I went into the procedure knowing that I did not have coverage for abortion and that I would be paying the full cost of that procedure. During my consultation before the actual procedure my doctor informed me that I could get a birth control implant placed at the same time since I was already in the clinic and would be under anesthesia. I was informed that the implant would be fully covered by my insurance as it was preventative care. So I agreed to get it done the same day. Earlier this year I received a ### for my abortion that included the implant. I called my insurance and asked why they did not cover this. They said that they were ###ed for and paid for the insertion of the implant, but were not ###ed for the actual implant itself, which amounts to over $###. They said that they will would have covered the implant as well if they were ###ed for it. I was told that I could contact the hospital ###ing department to resubmit the claim so that they can cover the implant. I called the ###ing department who said that they cannot split the abortion procedure claim and any related expenses. I asked why they were able to ### the insertion charge as part of a different claim, but not the implant itself. They said that due to the way that the implant was coded in ###ing they could not change the claim. I was not told that I would be responsible for the implant at the time that I got it and I asked why the doctor would even offer to do the implant at the same time if she knew that it would be coded under my abortion visit claim. The ###ing department stated that often times the doctor's do not know how ###ing works and just send out codes for ###ing. I want to know what my rights are in terms of being ### of the charges. If I had known that I would have been charged for something that my health insurance policy states they would cover and that the doctor stated would be covered just because I got it on the same day as something that was not covered by my insurance then I would have just come back another day. I feel as though I should not be legally responsible for paying for the implant. I do not believe that ### cannot change the claim. They ###ed the insertion of the insert as a separate visit. I do not understand how they can charge the insertion of something without also charging the implant inserted within the same claim. Thank you for your help.### ###43641.75625 I'd like to do a health care power of attorney.

You can certainly do that but you would probably have to draft your own document.  However I want to make sure you realize the impediment you would be creating by naming "joint" healthcare agents.  So you are in a car wreck - ### - in desperate need of emergency surgery.  You want the hospital to get in touch with two different people and get them to agree with the emergency surgery.  If either of them doesn't agree - you don't get emergency surgery.  If they can only reach one but not the other - you don't get emergency surgery.  Is this really how you want it to work?"43654.7840277778 You do not have to use an attorney.  Make sure your witnesses and Notary are not related to you and do not work for the healthcare industry. 43657.8284722222 thank you for helping me understand.  do I have to do a health care power of attorney through an attorney?  Or can it be self prepared with two witnesses and notary?43656.0861111111 I am sorry that this was your experience with this hospital. I hope that this never happens to you or your family again. For future reference if you are ever at this hospital or any other hospital and have any issues with the staff that are not being resolved with front-line management, you could always ask to speak with the hospital administrator. The hospital administrator or his/her designee is available 24/###. This person is available to resolve issues for staff, but also to address the concerns of patients and family members. If you feel comfortable doing so, it might be helpful to write a letter to the hospital administration, just to share your story. This could help the hospital improve the quality of their service, improve patient safety, and increase patient and family satisfaction. If you are still not satisfied with the response you receive, you could also reach out to the Joint Commission, the national accrediting organization for hospitals at ###.I hope you find this helpful.Thank you.43677.0333333333 Mr. De ###The parent or legally responsible person has authority over the childâ€™s healthcare. However, in c### where the parent and doctor disagree about treatment and the doctor feels the parent is preventing the child from receiving necessary medical treatment the doctor may take steps to do what is in the best interests of the child. In such c###, the doctor could contact authorities, such as Department of Social Services (DSS). Do you know if DSS was contacted in your c###?Without additional information, it would be difficult to say exactly why you were escorted from the hospital. Each hospital has its own policies regarding patient visitation and contact with staff. Understanding this hospitalâ€™s policy might help answer this question. Often, patient visitation can be restricted by the doctor or the nurse in charge of the patient care unit if in their judgment the visit is in not beneficial to the patient, staff, or operation of the unit.Are you seeking a specific remedy or resolution in this matter?43670.0680555556 Thank you for your reply. The officers kept telling me Child Protective Services (CPS) were called and on their way, but they removed me before anyone talked to me. I called the local CPS office in the parking lot afterwards and they said they received no report of any incident under my name.The only resolution I would like is for families to not be treated the way they are at that hospital. I looked up ### online afterwards and found several other stories that are identical to mine at this exact hospital. The hospital likes to use its Campus Police to intimidate and push people into conforming to what they want to happen. Some days later, they sent local law enforcement to our house for a welfare check. The officers said the report they got said I would be angry with my wife. Earlier that day, my wife and her father were at the hospital and the staff asked them if I was violent, to which they of course answered no.Their actions are obviously unethical and I believe my rights were violated when they continually ignored me asking to transfer hospitals. I don't care about compensation, I just care about what is right.Thank you for your time.43672.4479166667 Who has ultimate authority over a child's healthcare?My child was born on Monday at a hospital. Me and my wife watched over him in our room until the following afternoon around ###.M. A nurse came in and said they wanted to examine him further in the nursery. They took him and were gone for about ###, in which I kept asking if I could see him and what was going on. They told me they were just examining him and to wait a few minutes and will bring him back.Finally a doctor came in and said he breathing was slightly elevated and it was most likely some fluid in the lungs from birth, a very common issue that should clear up in a few days. They had also taken x-rays and inserted an IV without telling us.  They said they wanted to transfer him to another hospital to have him examined better, I disagreed but they said they would not be comfortable or capable to keep him at the current hospital.Reluctantly my wife agreed to the transfer. He arrived around ###.M. and it was about an hour before they allowed me into the room to see him. At this point, I know it had been awhile since he ate and asked to feed him and they told me I could not and it was dangerous with his ### elevated breathing, although he been eating since birth at the other hospital without any incident.In the morning around ###.M. when the morning nurse came in, I raised my concerns with the decisions of his healthcare. They  told me the doctors would make their rounds in about an hour and I could speak to them. I spoke to his doctor and we were going back and forth about what was absolutely necessary because I had been getting contradictory information. They assured me everything was necessary and there was a potential for harm if they did not perform these procedures. I questioned the risk because previous the doctors told me it was a common issue which self resolves in a few days.They allowed me to feed him a bottle, which he had no issue with. I asked if we could remove the IV since he was eating. They said it was not safe. I said I would like a different opinion in the matter, what are my options. They said I could transfer him to another hospital or doctor but that they would all agree with them. I said I wanted to do that then, and shortly after they brought ###. They said staff said I was harassing them and preventing them from treating the child, which is not true. They escorted me off the premises and said I would be charged with trespassing if I returned and that I could not see my child in their hospital.43657.8611111111 ###, If your question is whether the hospital committed medical malpractice by providing you with someone else's discharge papers, probably not.  In order to have a medical malpractice claim, there must be an element of harm.  I hope this is helpful. 43690.74375 On ### I went to ### Regional Medical Center to try to get treated for my mental health. They didnâ€™t really ask me any questions or help me with anything. I never received any care. They discharged me saying that I didnâ€™t seem like Iâ€™d do any harm to myself or anyone else. They then prescribed high blood pressure medicine. When I got to a friends house I looked over my discharge papers and it wasnâ€™t my information it was someone ###. So I think I they got our discharge papers mixed up. 43671.6583333333 Hello my name is ###, i am ###. I had a heart attack ###. As such i suffered 10% dead tissue to form in my heart. I have been dealing with this and many other ailments these past years now including a lengthy hospital visit. During my hospital visit i was told by medical staff to apply for Medicare for my bills and to also apply for Social Security as Medicare would kick in if SS approved me. I don't have any means to keep up my health care and no way to pay my past hospital bills so i did apply for Social Security and Medicare ###. Medicare originally turned me down but Social Security has dealt with me for the past ###. Last month i got the notice of my hearing denial from SS admin, they also informed me i would have ###. Then ### law said they would not keep representing me and that they turned my case over to the Disability Justice group and that they would contact me shortly. I was recently notified by ### Law after calling back myself to find out why DJ never contacted me that DJ also recused themselves from my case. At this point i don't know what else to do as i was told in the denial letter, ###, that i would have ###. I have been out of work the past ###.

Thank you very much for listening.43672.3361111111 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question, and I regret that this happened to you.  I would consult with a local personal injury or civil rights lawyer to better evaluate the viability of claim.  Based on your brief statement of the situation, I see no grounds for negligence, but I am sure there is more to the story than what this posting reveals.  Many personal injury lawyers (and likely a few civil rights lawyers as well) will offer free consultation of ###, or charge a small fee for the same, so there is no harm in seeking a preliminary opinion from counsel about whether you have enough of a case to go forward.  Normally I would say personal injury lawyers is the way to go, but since this happened in the course of incarceration, this might be a civil rights issue as well.  Use ### Find a Lawyer" feature as a free search tool for looking up lawyers in and around ### as well as contacting the ### County Bar and the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association to the extent needed.

Healthcare ### are fresh on my mind right now, as I met yesterday with a client to complete one, so I appreciate your asking us this question on NC Free Legal Answers.Since your mother does not presently retain her normal mental competency and faculties, the only alternative to a healthcare POA is to seek court-appointed guardianship over her physical person (guardian of the person") similar to how your brother is "guardian of the estate."  Whether you or your brother should seek to be the exclusive guardian of the person or should seek to be appointed as equal and joint guardians of the person is something that you two will need to work out beforehand.  If your resources allow you should hire a local elder ### attorney to assist you with preparing a Petition for Guardianship before the ### County Clerk of Superior Court and to pursue the guardianship action to its logical conclusion.  I would begin with an initial consultation with one of the reputable attorneys in town or closely nearby.Blessings and best wishes to you your mother and your family this winter."43774.8006944444 My mother is incompetent due to ###.  She has been clinically diagnosed with stage ###.  My father, her husband died ###.  My brother is her court appointed guardian over her money, but she needs a medical POA.  How do we handle this?43774.7965277778 Thank you very much for all of your help43774.8291666667 Thank you very much.  Does the guardian of the person" automatically become the "guardian of the estate or could the current guardian of the estate" remain in place and a "guardian of the person" be added?"43774.8111111111 The latter.  These are two entirely different kinds of guardianships.  They can be consolidated into one if the Clerk so orders, but if the final Order in your brother's appointment does not include ### powers, these can be sought in a separate, subsequent action, either by you, by him, by both, or by someone else who is morally and financially fit to fulfill this role, based on specific evidence and findings of fact noted in the Clerk's final order.  Be well.43774.8131944444 You are most welcome.  God bless you and yours.43774.8305555556 Absolutely.  Blessings to you, and thank you for your well wishes.43776.625 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  The first thing you need to do is consult with a North ### medical malpractice lawyer to see if there is really a case to begin with; nothing you post here indicates negligence by the doctor, even if your hopes of full recovery from the surgery have not been fulfilled as of yet.  Consulting with a medical malpractice lawyer and sharing (###) a brief fact summary of your situation (###-###), and (###) your medical records relating to your surgeries and their aftermath will help the lawyer make a preliminary finding about viable claims (or lack thereof).  Essentially, successful medical malpractice claims depend on proof that the doctor breached the standard of care to his/her patient by providing treatment or care that fell below the industry standard for a similarly educated, experienced and ### doctor in the same local medical community, and that as a result of such substandard treatment or care, you suffered physical or serious emotional/psychological damages.  This must be proven based on testimony of an expert witness who is also a doctor, and is retained by your lawyer to provide deposition or trial testimony based on the expert witnesses' detailed review of your medical records.Among your vetting resources can be ### Find a Lawyer" feature the ### County Bar and the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association.  I wish you well in your legal inquiries regarding medical malpractice and send my prayers and best wishes for your health and convalescence from your recent surgeries.  Have a blessed winter and Thanksgiving in a couple weeks."43776.1708333333 I have had ###. After the second one he said everything was ok. Call me if I needed him. My foot is so bad, as the new doctor told me it can't be fixed. He could try a couple things to make me comfortable. How can I take action against this doctor?43776.1583333333 Thank you for all your help. Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family.43776.2708333333 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  Medical malpractice is one of the most difficult and nuanced areas of the law in which to assert a case, and such cases are vigorously contested and ### against by ### insurance companies who protect the doctors.  All that to say, it is impossible to provide you with responsible and accurate assessments as to whether medical malpractice occurred without consulting in person with a medical malpractice lawyer.  Many such lawyers will provide initial consultations of one hour either for free or (relatively) low cost.  I would search online on ### and use the Find a Lawyer" feature and check with the Wake County Bar and Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association for possible lawyers from whom to request a consultation on this issue.A successful medical malpractice claim needs to show that the doctor provided treatment or care that fell below the normal standard of care by doctors of similar education training and experience in the same local region of practice (in this case the North Carolina ### community) and that the result of that subpar treatment or care was an injury to the plaintiff.  Not all instances in which a plaintiff is injured are the result of medical malpractice so this angle will be ### very carefully.  If the lawyer shows more than an initial interest in this case s/he will want to see your girlfriend's medical records and speak in detail about everything that happened from the time she was admitted to the hospital or healthcare facility after she passed out.  Much more so than in other areas of law each and every tiny detail matter so your girlfriend will need a lawyer to look this over ###.  If she cannot point to a specific injury that would not have happened but for an established fact of treatment below the normal standard of care winning a case against her doctor of the doctor's facility will be next to impossible.  Consultations of this kind will help you accurate vet your chances of success as well as the monetary value of any viable potential claims against doctors or facilities.If you decide to take this up further I hope your legal inquiries will be productive.  I wish you the best in this matter.  Blessings to you both this winter and Thanksgiving."43790.7166666667 Good morning, on ### my girlfriend went to the hospital (###) after passing out. The passing out was out of no where and plus she hit her head ###â€™t feeling well for the pass week. She was complaining that her head hurts and it gets worst while she is standing. We go check in and everything seem fine until they took us into a room. At that time they only did a ### witch turned out fine. When the doctor came in the room at first he didnâ€™t know who we were until he kept saying random patients scenarios also tried to make story up why was there. He didnâ€™t put her on a IV nor did any blood work and ask her if she wanted to go back to work and then left( he was literally in the room no more then ###) the nurse came in the room to give the discharge papers. And i asked him in a very concerning way â€œshould there be more test like blood work or anything to make sure she is fineâ€ he replied back very aggressively with an ###, well if the doctor doesn't seem like thereâ€™s anything wrong then no. But you can talk with himâ€ to be honest i wanted to talk with the doctor but after the way he talk to me and the doctor not even telling her to drink water then i felt like we had to go an other hospital. As we went to wake med they did all the testing and found out that she has low blood pressure, UTI, low thyroid, and a mild concussion. As well they prescribe medication to her. I felt that if she went home after the 1st hospital she would be feeling worst. And honestly i felt scared if something really happen to her if we didnâ€™t go to wake med. is there anything we can do? We felt like If we go any hospital then we should be treated the same. As well on the discharge papers with ### describe that she had a faint but the care wasnâ€™t for adults it was how to treat a child after passing out. I felt like that was an insult towards us. 43790.7041666667 Thank you as well have a good thanksgiving and winter43790.7208333333 Hi Ms. ###.  If you talked to the hospital's attorney, it is unlikely that the hospital would offer any compensation without, first,  consulting with an attorney that you retain.  I recommend that you consult with a medical malpractice attorney that handles plaintiffs' medical malpractice cases.   Please contact the North Carolina Lawyer Referral Service at 1-800-###, or visit the website at https://www.ncbar.org/public-resources/lawyer-referral-service/    Let the service know that you would like a referral for a medical malpractice attorney.

Honestly, it is impossible to say for certain on a site like this whether you have a successful medical malpractice claim to pursue against Dr. ###.  As you might know, medical malpractice suits are very hard to win in North Carolina, and are vigorously ### against by ### civil ### paid by the doctor's liability insurance company.  This does not at all mean that you should be intimidated or that you should give up, however; you will just have to consult in more ### ### a medical malpractice lawyer.  There are some very good choices in ###, Hickory and ###, among cities in your western part of the state.For an initial consultation, the medical malpractice lawyer you work with will schedule an appointment for discussion, and will also be highly interested in reviewing your pertinent medical records; so if you have not yet ordered or gotten together all such records, go ahead and do so during January so that you will have all this ready for the consultation.  If your lawyer is of the preliminary opinion that you have a case worth pursuing, s/he will likely retain a doctor who is an expert witness to go through the records and certify that a breach of the normal standard of medical care occurred, thereby likely causing your damages and injury.Many medical malpractice lawyers offer free or low-cost initial consultations, and if one of them agrees to take your case, the expenses and costs of the lawsuit will be fronted by the law firm, with payment to the lawyer on the back end if there is a settlement, court judgment or jury award, as can be negotiated between you and the lawyer.Among your sources for referrals can be ### Find a Lawyer" search function the Buncombe County Bar and the ### County Bar.I wish you a productive inquiry into this most important legal matter.

Should I wait some more or should I get a lawyer for low income people to get a hearing with DSS ?Thank you,### ######-###43839.9229166667 First, being declared disabled by Social Security for medicaid purposes is a difficult drawn out procedure.  Lawyers often write the letters for doctor's to sign that has the language needed to get approved.  Doctor's notes no not always contain the correct language.  Although once declared it works for medicaid and SSDI and SSI. Is there some-reason you aren't attempting to get SSI or SSDI.  I can't tell from your letter if you have tried to get into these programs.  If you have a work history you are eligible for SSDI and only have to show disability If you do not have enough work history you are eligible for SSI which requires proof of disability and low assets (less than $###,###).  Medicaid does not require a disability if you have less than $###.  Given this background, I would suggest you look for an elder law attorney who works with disability issues to figure out what program fits you the best. They should also be able to tell you what steps you need to take to get approved for this program.  Many times you will be able to handle at least some of the process by yourself. Since you have already applied I would wait for an answer and that may take some time.  When you get the response and its a denial, contact an elder law attorney with disability experience to help you with next steps. Good luck in this process!43852.7125 My first thought was the magistrate and the involuntary commitment process.  Since you mentioned magistrate you might have already tried this.  Another avenue might be to file an incompetency proceeding against your son in the Special Proceeding division of your Court Clerkâ€™s office.  The court will hold a hearing to determine whether your son is incompetent.  When I say court I am referring to the clerk.  The court will start with the assumption that he is competent and you will need to present evidence that he is not.  This might include medical records and other information related to his drug use.  if the court finds he is not competent to make appropriate decisions the court will determine him incompetent.  If found incompetent then the court will appoint a guardian.  The finding of incompetence and appointment of a guardian takes away from your son his legal rights and places them in the guardian.  The guardian then makes decisions, for instance going to rehab.  Look at the website ###; find the button for forms and search for guardian.  There you will see a pamphlet regarding the responsibilities of a guardian and you will see a guardianship questionnaire.  The questionnaire is helpful in identifying the type of information the court will use to make the incompetence determination.Those are my best legal thoughts.  However keep in mind that even a guardian will have limits as to the physical actions that can be taken, but a guardian may be more successful with the magistrates involuntary commitment process.I hope you are able to get help for your son.43852.7215277778 My son is  ###, and is on drugs badly. In trying to find answers to get him in a rehab help is been hard. Some family and myself have sought the magistrate, officers, drs, probation officers and find they will not do nothing in the matter. Excuses mostly. He's not willing himself to get help and has over doesed several times, the last, ###, littersky died for a couple moments. When ### took him to Dr, the Dr knew all of this and turned him loose , in which he went right back out to it. The PO says it's not her problem and she's not a baby ### but probation. If he has been locked up they let anyone bond him out. This mrth and heroin will eventually kill him and I'm not wanting to have to bury him this way.

Any advice as to how to get around the ### tape where someone will commit him?He knows he needs help and is doing for help in a way but too far in to do it himself, before getting him talked into it he's gone again out doing dripugs till the next time. Any advice , the system is a failure at this, to not ###ognized what's being asked for but not doing what they should be knowing there's a problem. ### ###. ### nc43852.1534722222 Dear Ms. Huml, Thanks for your question and I am sorry to hear about this frustrating issue with your insurance, which I am sure has impacted your life a great deal.  It is our understanding that you wish to no longer receive Medicare coverage and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.  We canâ€™t advise you whether this is the best plan financially, but you may look to the following resources for suggested assistance:  The ultimate goal for terminating Medicare Part B (assuming B is the one relevant to you) is to submit Form ### 1763 (link: https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-02713). It appears you are required to have an interview to terminate your coverage using this form. I understand you may have already done this last year but, unfortunately, you may have to follow-up with them and resubmit the form if they give you permission to do so. Perhaps you could call them and see if you could attempt to submit the form over the phone instead of going to the office. https://www.usa.gov/medicare#item-36827.  As for the SSI, it is possible you might be able to still receive some benefits while working. The following link goes through different scenarios of your work condition and whether or not the SSA would consider your work level â€œsubstantialâ€ (https://www.ssa.gov/planners/disability/work.html). This booklet provides information on how to report your work condition: https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10153.pdf. It is also possible you may qualify for benefits while you are working: https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10095.pdf.Hope this information helps and that you are able to get this resolved soon.Take care.43872.7493055556 I got SSI for my disability in ###, I have Muscular ### (MD). I did not know at the time that I would also get Medicaid/Medicare along with the SSI, I never used it because I was under my dad's insurance. I started working full time in ###. I also turned 26 (and got kicked off dad's insurance) in ###. I have been trying to cancel my Medicare (don't know why I got Medicare as I thought that was for older folks) ever since then with no success. I have not been able to see a few of my doctors I've had for years (who understand my rare form of MD) because they do not accept Medicare. Several times, I have had to pay out of pocket for doctor's visits because Medicare shows up as my primary but will not accept the charge. I've had a myriad of issues with it and just want to cancel it so I only have my United insurance through work. I have been to the SS office several times, and filled out a form last year to have it canceled. It is still on. So is my SSI. I keep getting told so many different things and having to pay back SSI. How do I cancel both for good? Specifically Medicare. Do I need an attorney? I need access to healthcare.43857.8395833333 I got approved for Medicaid transportation on ###th ### (the day I called to arrange medical transportation which was five days in advance) through December of ###. I also received a ### medical transportation notice in the mail today when social services didn't even pay for my fare nor provided transportation to and from my doctor appointment. I had to pay my own fare to and from the doctor appointment and arrange transportation. I'm going to ask for a hearing to see about clearing up my ### strike/warning. I have email correspondence from the caseworkers about the situation. My doctor appointment was on ###rd, ###. Social services told me the first day I called to arrange the appointment that they would make sure they paid for my fare to and from my appointment and that they were going to call my doctor's office to verify the appointment. So that I can receive possible future medical transportation services and current services from social services (food stamps and medicaid coverage); should I sign the notice of rights and responsibilities form they sent me in the mail today and send it back to them OR pay for my own future transportation AND file a disability discrimination/discrimnation lawsuit against the Department of social services for not providing service?43857.94375 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your very detailed fact summary, and for your important question.  Your concerns here are very understandable, and are similar to what any parent would feel in this situation.  Based on what you described, a technical violation of HIPPA has in fact occurred--at the very minimum--but now the question is whether this was a one-time mistake due to clerical error or carelessness in the office, or whether this was a repeated, willful act that would qualify the medical office for a civil and/or criminal sanction under federal law.  I do not know which one applies, but I suspect that this is more of a carelessness situation rather than a willful or malicious act to expose another person's medical records.As you may know, HIPPA does not authorize civil suits for breaches, but if you do not get a satisfactory explanation from the senior management at the medical office, you can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which will then investigate the matter and determine whether there should be punishment in the form of civil and/or criminal fines.  HOWEVER, I would not as a first resort go that route.  I would at least politely but firmly confront the management at the medical office and return the records you were sent in error.  See if there is a serious hearing among the management for your concerns as to why this happened, and why this should not happen again.  If you feel that they respected your views and took you seriously, you may wish to just end it there.  If you believe you were disrespected or that this was taken too lightly, then yes, you should consider filing a complaint with U.S. DHHS.  Here is the link just in case you wish to explore this:https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/index.htmlI hope this information is helpful, and that this will not happen again at this medical office.  You have good reason to be concerned.  God bless you and your family in ###.43868.9777777778 My daughter recently went to a doctor's appointment and we were waiting to receive the records to detail the results of her recent visit. I inquired about not receiving the records and was informed that the records were sent out in the mail. Once I received the envelop addressed to me, I opened it like any other mail. The records inside were not my daughter's. They belonged to another child. I informed the location. The receptionist had me confirm the medical records number and name of the patient. They apologized and told me that they were going to investigate the matter and send me a prepaid envelop to send the records back. I asked about my child's records and was told no one called complaining of receiving my daughter's record. I am concerned the records were switched and a HIPAA violation has occurred. I can see the records show when they were printed (date and time) and  who printed the record. I am pretty sure if my daughter's record was accessed and/or printed they can see that but will not tell me. I am trying to find out if this indeed is a HIPAA violation and if so, what type of lawyer I will need to proceed with this case?43868.9444444444 About four years ago I went to the emergency room with confusion, rapid heart rate, nausea, and hallucinating. I was talking out of my head but enough to ask for toxicology testing. They did a ekg and radiographs. Then had me involuntarily committed. After I still remained sick. Last week an amalgam filling broke and had it replaced with composite. I am feeling better but not completely but I have several amalgam fillings. If I was tested and it was because of the fillings would I have a case against the hospital? 43882.2201388889 Hello, Ms. ###:Thank you for this very important question.  Honestly, the only way to know for sure whether there is a valid medical malpractice or other personal injury claim is to consult with a law firm that handles these types of cases (probably, I would start with medical malpractice, then ask about the personal injury aspect in the event that they are separate legal issues/claims in your situation).  It is impossible to say on a website like this whether you have a good case, since these matters are very fact-specific and require a lawyer's analysis of both your more detailed account of what happened, as well as pertinent medical records.  Only then can a lawyer tell you with certainty whether the healthcare providers offered treatment or services that fell beneath the standard of care for the medical profession in similarly situated communities such as rural, western North Carolina.Also, please keep in mind that the statute of limitations for medical malpractice and personal injury cases is three years in North Carolina, so if the treatment of which you complain happened before ###, you are already out of time to file a lawsuit against the hospital.If you are still within your three-year period, however, by all means search online (perhaps using ### Find a Lawyer" feature in addition to Google) and find several North Carolina lawyers who practice medical malpractice and serious injury cases then reach out to them for an initial consultation.  Many of these lawyers offer consultations of up to ###.  Then you can be assured that you are fully and correctly advised of your options.I hope that your body spirit and mind heal ### in ###.  God bless you through these challenges.  Thank you again for posting on NC Free Legal Answers."43882.2319444444 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Medical malpractice cases are among the most difficult to gauge or vet in online forums like this one, because the cases are so ###, and contingent upon details that only medical records reveal.  The facts you shared here are serious and compelling enough to warrant an initial consultation with a North ### medical malpractice lawyer to better determine whether a strong case exists, and if so, what is likely monetary value is.  The lawyer you consult with would need a fact summary similar to the one you included here (with a slightly longer narrative for the lawyer's general information--perhaps ###-###?), plus all pertinent medical records from both generalists and specialists that you consulted.  The lawyer will then have a fairly accurate idea of whether to retain medical experts who might testify later in depositions or trial that your care was below the acceptable standard of care for similarly situated doctors in similar communities to central North Carolina.Many medical malpractice lawyers will offer either free or low-cost consultations for up to ### ###.  I see no downside to at least consulting with one or two medical malpractice firms, to see what your options are more precisely.  The worst that can happen is that they provide you a detailed legal opinion as to why a claim should not be pursued.I recommend using ### Find a Lawyer" search function to look for medical malpractice lawyers in or near Greensboro ### High Point ### and/or any other towns or cities within a comfortable driving distance from ### County.  Blessings and best wishes to you as you heal and inquire further about your legal options in regards to this potential claim.  Be well."43886.8930555556 Hello I don't know if I have a case.I broke my ankle ###. He ordered x-### and an MRI and said my ankle was not broken just wait and it would get better"After ###. the specialist was in the same group. He ordered no tests and told me I has "traumatic arthritis" and my bones would have to be cut and fused. So I asked the 1st Dr for another specialist referral and the 3rd doctor saw me ### took ###-### and showed me clearly on the x-ray how the bone had broken and pushed the ankle entirely out if line.So I had been trying to walk on a broken ankle for ###. He (Dr) just did the surgery this past Thursday. I have never sued anyone before even when I had cause but I am angry because I went to the Dr with a swollen bruised ankle and told him it was broken(I knew because I had broken it ###) and no one did anything for all those months. I do not know if this can be considered malpractice since the first and second doctors did not DO ANYTHING but I think some legal recourse might be called for?"43886.7625 Good afternoon, Ms. Blalock:Thank you for this important question.  I agree with you that only the biological parents and/or legal guardians have the right to sign this authorization, unless you as one of the biological parents have signed a sufficient legal instrument delegating such authority to the stepmother, or the stepmother is recognized as having this authority under a court order from a legal proceeding.  Otherwise, she should not sign authorizations for medical treatment of minor children.This may or may not be the fault of the medical provider--at least in the sense of a willful HIPPA violation.  If the medical provider believed based on the ### status that she was authorized to approve healthcare services for the child--or was in the mistaken belief that the stepmother was the actual parent of the ### provider would have been technically in violation of HIPPA, but would not have willfully" or "maliciously" violated the same and would likely not be penalized by U.S. ### as long as it was advised of this mistake and took reasonable efforts not to repeat it again.  This should be brought to the medical provider's attention so that it can be given a ### chance to explain its error and correct it as needed.If that does not work you may wish to schedule a consultation with a local family law attorney in ### County to discuss taking further action as needed.  I hope that this can be worked out to your reasonable satisfaction in an amicable way.God bless you and your family this spring."43895.8263888889 Is it legal for a new (###) stepmom who has no legal authority or custody of child to sign authorization for treatment and being present during exam without my knowledge of said exam taking place.

My sense is, if your mother still has episodes of lucidity, whether naturally or under medication, she should be able to sign a health care power of attorney (POA). She just has to be mentally competent at the time she signs it.  She needs to understand what she is signing.If you are her next of kin, you should be able to make some decisions for her, as well, without the POA--at least in the short ###.  It may depend on the policy of the facility where she is being held.  Have you asked them?I do not know in which county you would file for guardianship -- it could be the one in which your mother is currently residing (at the health care facility). In the meantime, there is this law firm in Greensboro that specializes in Elder Care, and they've written this article about ### and Guardianship:  https://www.elderlawfirm.com/power-of-attorney-and-guardianship-in-north-carolina/You can do a Google search for elder law firm" and the name of the city or county near you.I can look to see if there are others.

As long as the power of attorney is executed in NC according to NC law, that is all that is required.If, after you read through these sources, you still have questions -- please do not hesitate to ask.Best wishes to you and your mother,Linda43895.75 Hi Linda, thanks for getting back. She has not been formally adjudicated yet. She was just involuntarily committed ###, babbling incoherently, and then the doctors in the ER noted her condition. Though not formally diagnosed, during a recent visit with a psychologist, she was told she's bipolar. She was just transferred this morning to Old Vineyard Behavioral Services in  ### ### and a doctor is seeing her tomorrow morning.If you could recommend law firms that would be great or how I could search for one. Doesn't have the right to an attorney at no charge? She doesn't have much money. Also, where would we file the petition for guardianship, in the county where she is being held, or in the county where I live?43895.8243055556 How do I get guardianship or healthcare power of attorney for my mother who was just involuntarily committed to Old Vineyard Health Services in ### ### NC, which is in ### County. My mother is a Wisconsin resident, while I am I resident in Wake County, NC, if that makes any difference. She needs someone to advocate for her asap.43895.6784722222 Thank you so much for your help Linda!43896.1291666667 You're very welcome, ###.  I hope you find some resolution and that your mom gets the treatment she needs to feel better and function better.  I can imagine this is very difficult for both of you and the family.Let me know if there is anything else I can do.Regards,Linda43896.4965277778 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  These are all excellent questions, and I will briefly answer them below.  Please see the following:First, you are correct that your mother is not mentally competent to sign an estate planning instrument (including but not limited to a power of attorney), based on what you described about here here.  Yes, you will need to seek a guardianship appointment in order to make decisions in her name (we call it guardianship" in NC which is the same as "conservatorship" in California and other states that employ the ###).Second yes you are correct that the authority who would appoint you as your mother's guardian is the Clerk of Superior Court.  You would begin the process by filing a Petition for Guardianship with the Clerk.  A guardian ad litem will be appointed for your mother and that person will interview your mother and de###ine the extent of her mental and other abilities.  To the extent needed the Clerk might also appoint a medical professional to have your mother evaluated for purposes of the guardianship proceeding.  At the end of the process--probably not terribly long given the circumstances at play--the Clerk will appoint you as the guardian either of your mother's finances or person (or both) unless there is another family member who contests that prospect or unless the Clerk finds that you are unfit for such a role (I know of no reason why that would be so).Third no lawyer is required by law to start this process but navigating the procedure of this and knowing what to file and when will be much easier if you can afford to hire counsel for this matter.  You would wish to hire an elder law attorney for this type of case.  ### "Find a Lawyer" feature can help you ### search for counsel in this area and you can also Google "elder law attorneys ### County NC."  You can moreover call the ### Count Bar Association and see if they offer free referrals in this area.  Lastly ### F. ###001070 of ### County (next door to ###) is an excellent elder law attorney and one whom I know well; I used to clerk for him and his former firm when I was in law school.  You can look him up and call and let him know that his former law clerk ### ### recommended you to him with strong commendation.Fourth I think that both ### and Wake are ### counties for venue and it will depend on where your mother is likely to be physically present for the near future.  I suspect that ### is the better venue since that is where your mother's facility is but if your long-### plan is to have your mother with you in Wake County that could be a ### reason to have guardianship proceedings in Wake County.  If you hire a lawyer for this s/he can offer you additional insight into the venue question.I hope this helps you somewhat.  God bless you and your mother this spring.  I know that this situation is less than ideal and pray you strength and peace of mind as you work through it."43895.8152777778 My mother has just been involuntarily committed because of mental illness to Old Vineyard Behavorial Services in ### ### NC and has no one to advocate for her.I assume because of her current situation she's considered mentally incompetent to sign a power of attorney. In that case, my understanding is the next step is to initiate conservatorship proceedings with a Clerk of Court. How do I do that and does it have to happen in the county where she is currently located - ### County - or in the county where I live, which is Wake and does it require an attorney?43895.7638888889 My ### ### for her mental health disorder. My daughter has suffered with this since the age of ###. After seeing this therapist for the first time, the therapist advised us To go to the local emergency room for a Mental health assessment. Being compliant, we went. After being at the emergency room for ###, after two hours of waiting for discharge documents my daughter was held against her will and restrained. Everything we told the physician was turned around, they manifested her diagnoses and admitted her into the hospital for absolutely no reason. My daughter was given shots, and restrained. I was kicked out of the hospital. I missed a college class. My daughter missed school, and work. Her manager said she would write a statement saying my daughter was indeed a very stable employee. When I went to visit my daughter one of the nurses asked me â€œwhy my daughter was even thereâ€. On ###/###, she never told a provider anything that would have made them think she was unstable. This is wrong on so many levels.

Whether you were exposed or not isn't really the question.  You didn't state whether you wee tested within the few days after that and if you were positive and then became sick or hospitalized.  If not, most likely not a case.

Sincerley, ### ### 44301.8034722222 My wife was an outpatient at ### Behavioral Health.  We had issues communicating with her team and were going in circles getting some record transferred and other things, so I complained against the Doctor.  The Doctor called me, and told a number of lies suggesting she hadn't even checked our records.  (She had recommended an evaluation, we followed up with the ###rdinator, she clearly stated that she wasn't recommending the evaluation at that point -- but if that were true, the ###rdinator could have told us to stop seeking the treatment at any time over a two month period of time going in circles and not getting the referral.)I complained to the hospital, and despite numerous individuals being brought on, we couldn't reach a resolution to the problem and how it was effecting my wife's treatment referral for months, so we offered to just pick up our medical records and take them elsewhere.   We did -- and when we read through them we found out that they were peppered with ### lies and defamatory remarks that seemed aimed at discrediting my complaint.  Information about my wife was very inaccurate, and strange statements were attributed to both of us, plus there were strange remarks that I was gay" and casting aspersions over the purpose of our marriage and shifting the focus of treatment onto convincing my wife that I was controlling and gaslighting her even though my concerns to the hospital are mirrored in the observations of other members of the treatment time.  (These ### remarks appear mainly in the doctors notes and seem ### in type-os and odd auto-corrects.)I contacted the hospital to complain and asked if they could check the time stamps on the records wondering if the reason the records weren't released and info was inaccurate was that the records were made up in a hurry when we requested them.   The Vice President of ### Operations and I believe the Chief Psychiatrist acting as ### were brought in and agreed to investigate.   A few days later they brought me into a zoom meeting stating that findings that warranted escalations to their legal and compliance office were found.  Today I received an e-mail requesting me to attend a zoom meeting with members who seem to be the VP CAO a supervisor and two members of their legal team from legal and compliance.

We've contacted numerous attorneys, and some have told us that damages would be minimal for a case like this and hourly representation would be costly.    Is there a process that without a lawyer we could have a judge examine the records, subpoena time stamps and look into our claims of falsification, and the hospital be ordered to void, correct or ### the records, and pay for re-assessment and treatment elsewhere?

The document was never notorized even though it included a page for a notary public.In the last couple of months she became very demanding of my time and added a lot of stress to my daily life. I suffer from various mental and physical illnesses and we both came to the conclusion that I would not be best person to fulfill these duties. She decided to release me of these obligations about three weeks ago when we discussed it in person.

There is no requirement for an investigation  much less a fair investigation. The only thing an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon the employee being a member of a protected class (race, age, sex, religion, national origin or disability). Right or wrong the employer is within its rights to discharge and there is very little recourse. 43473.2659722222 In Missouri slander cases are exceedingly difficult cases to make. 30+ years ago the Missouri Supreme Court eliminated per se ###.  Under per se ### all that you needed to show was that something communicated was false and of such a nature that damages to one's reputation was presumed.  In those cases the jury could award $###.  With the elimination of per se ### you must now prove actual monetary damages as a direct result of the slander or libel.  This is very often exceedingly difficult to do.  For example, if the employer ### the employee based upon a belief that the employee borrowed $###, the resulting lost wages do not qualify as damages from the alleged ###.  The ### believing the information caused the employment loss, not the ###'s subsequent ### to a third-party party. No doubt if this information gets around it may well be hard for the nurse to find another position in the area but it will be very hard for the nurse to prove that that she didn't get a specific job because of the alleged ###.  None of the potential employers are likely to admit that they refused to hire the nurse because of being told about the situation.If the matter is submitted to the Missouri Board of Nursing that will likely not be a basis for ### as such complaints are provided with qualified immunity. Lastly, the US Supreme Court has held that opinions are protected speech under the First Amendment so to the extent that the allegedly slanderous statement constitutes an opinion it cannot be a basis for slander.43472.7548611111 Thank you very much for that explanation. So if an investigation is started due to something said does that nurse have to give a statement?

If you are on the ### Medicaid program (which is Medicaid for the aged, blind or disabled) you do have to report your income but it may not affect your Medicaid coverage. For example, if you get Medicaid because you are disabled and also receiving SSI or SSDI benefits, you are allowed to work part time. As long as your income from work does not exceed the ### (substantial gainful activity) amount, you can keep your benefits. However you must report your income. For ### $###. For ### $###. This means that if you get Medicaid because you are disabled (through the ### program) and you earn less than $###.There are also programs that allow you to temporarily attempt to work when you are disabled. So you can ask about those programs which might allow you to continue your benefits while attempting to work - even if you earn more than the ### amounts above. I will try to attach a picture here with this information. The best places to get free legal advice are:  here, your local Legal Aid office and any other Missouri Bar program.  You can also go to your local MO Dept of Social Services office and they can explain your benefits and your reporting requirements. I hope this information helps. 43507.2319444444 I recently recieved a letter in the mail saying my MO health net is under review.

I would think that might be somewhat doubtful.           The bigger challenge seems to be to get the medical records.   If I am understanding you correctly, you have made a number of telephone calls.   I think your best option is to go for the ### walk-in and establish a personal relationship with someone there who wants to help you.   I tend to think that would get the records available to you.   I know this is not very ### legal advice.   However, I think it is the best advice for making something happen.   The phone calls appear to not be getting things done.

What type of ### would I look for?43522.8694444444 As I said if it is not a WC or similar issue then you should be able to get a fit for duty report from another doctor and there is no reason for the employer to require that a specific doctor sign off. I would press the issue with the employer rather than with the doctor. 43523.6625 I do not know of any legal basis in which you can force a doctor to provide you with a return to work form. Just like I donâ€™t have to represent anyone I donâ€™t feel like, a doctor has no legal obligation to treat anyone they choose not to. I recognize that you are not necessarily wanting treatment but rather a note saying you are fit to work but a doctor canâ€™t provide that without seeing and evaluating you. What doesnâ€™t make sense is that the employer wonâ€™t accept any other doctorâ€™s evaluation unless this is a work comp case and this is the work comp doctor. But if that is the case then why arenâ€™t they anxious to get you back to work to stop paying you temporary total disability benefits?### other circumstance that Iâ€™ve come across in which the employer may have a vested interest in ensuring that the return to work evaluation be done by a doctor of its choosing is where there has been some sort of incident that led it to require counseling or be evaluated by their psychiatrist before being able to return  Basically if there is no reason for the employer to insist on this particular doctor issuing the return to work note then this is an employment law issue and you can speak to an attorney in that field. If this is a work comp matter then you need to have your work comp attorney handle this and if you donâ€™t have one get one as you are foolish to handle it yourself. 43523.33125 I will try that. Thank you. 43523.94375 Thank you. Basically you are asking the same questions as I am. It is not a work comp issue. It may be that this doctor for whatever reason is discriminating against me or something as the such. Because I have been jumping through hoop after hoop to no avail. To my understanding all they needed was for me to be cleared by a neurologist. To which I have. There  are others in a similar career field that have the issues I â€œsupposedlyâ€ have, to which the specialist all have said I do not. This doctor has cost me over $30k in salary and so on, not being able to work in the position I was hired for. It does not make sense that I have provided everything the doctor has requested, has been given more than sufficient evidence that I am fit for duty, and still refuses to clear me. 43523.3493055556 Why would a doctor refuse to provide you with the medical clearance that you need without a medical reason?  That doesn't make much sense so I suspect that there is part of the story that is missing.  Have you been to see the physician recently so that you could be evaluated?  Is the doctor refusing to complete paperwork until you pay the fee charged by the physician's office?  Why is it that this doctor is refusing to provide you with what you are needing?  I don't feel comfortable addressing your issue without knowing the facts.43522.9298611111 Youâ€™re right, it does not make sense. Which is why Iâ€™m trying to go about finding a lawyer. No fees charged to ### paying for it all, last set of physician notes given to the doctor about two weeks ago per their request and the doctors response is â€œwhy are you giving me the same notes as before?â€ This being that this was their request, notes have ###. Iâ€™ve had a neurologist, psycologist, and so on, say that there is no reason that I should not be able to work. And they have been saying this for over a year. I just want to know what law practice this would fall under so I can consult a lawyer in person, with documentation, with all the dates, without vague information as presented here, to figure out if I have a case or not. 43523.0715277778 First, anyone seeking treatment for mental illness should be commended, not reprimanded. Medical records are protected under HIPPA laws and cannot be disclosed without your consent. I don't believe the treatment effects a license that is already in existence, but may effect the ability to obtain certain licenses in the future, depending on the type of condition / treatment sought / criminal history. I'm not familiar with a CCW, so I cannot speak to the requirements for that license. Simply seeing a psychiatrist for a medical condition does not exclusively prohibit your ability to obtain a hunting license and does not require the state to take your guns away. Criminal convictions may bar the individual from being able to own a gun, particularly if there is a felony conviction for illegally possessing opiates.Simply seeing a psychiatrist also typically does not bar anyone from working in a career of their choosing. Obviously if there is a criminal conviction, that may limit the areas of employment and ### opportunities. It's impossible to speak to each individual employer and what they'd require as a condition of employment. Some drug test, some don't. If the individual can't test negative for opioid use, that may prohibit his employment at a corporation who tests for that drug.I know of no instance where psychiatric treatment disqualified an individual for financial aid to college. This is a non-issue to me.43528.6819444444 First, thank you for taking the time to answer this for free. Assuming no legal ###, if a person seeks help for a medical condition such as an anxiety disorder or joins a program to help get off of prescribed opiates, what are the consequences of that? Can that lead to them losing their guns, hunting license, ccw or cdl? Can it affect ones ability to find work in a career such as engineering? Can it affect financial aid for college?Thanks again.43523.7430555556 Thank you43528.7333333333 Additional info:  1st surgeon was A.J. Strong, M.D. and 2nd surgeon was ### ###, M.D.   I have severely suffered with significant impairment to my ### and lifestyle.  I have to use a ### to walk more than ###!  Thank you for your consideration.  ### ###43530.8541666667 Ms. ###,I'm sorry you are having so much difficulty with your knee.  However whether or not you have a malpractice claim is an issue that is first determined by a medical opinion, and whether or not the treatment your received deviated from an objective standard of care.  Medical malpractice claims also usually have a short (two-year) statute of limitations.  The medical lobby is extremely strong thanks to the Missouri ### legislature, and one of the ### in the nation.  An attorney on this site for specific civil law questions cannot give you an opinion about your potential legal action.Your claim, if any, is probably time-barred -- BUT I would still encourage you to consult with a medical ### liability attorney -- just in case.  While it may be too late to bring an action against the doctor or hospital, there could be a products liability or other claim still viable.  You should locate an attorney to discuss your possible claim, and have him or her review your situation to see if there is any action which might still be possible. Many attorneys will not charge for an initial consultation, or the fee will be relatively small.  Obtaining medical records will be an additional expense.However keep in mind that there are often complications from any type of surgery, and there may be no negligence or malpractice involved in your case.  The fact that you have continued pain does not necessarily establish that anything was done wrong.  Apparently two doctors have concluded there is nothing unusual from the surgeries.  If you haven't already done so, you should obviously follow up with the neurologist as recommended.The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function here:  ###Best wishes.43530.875 My knee has been VERY painful and VERY swollen ever since the 1st surgery!  I've been back to both surgeons numerous times, had x-rays and they finally referred me to another orthopedic doctor who said everything looks good".

"43530.8430555556 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOU QUICK AND VERY INFORMATIVE REPLY!  YOU THOROUGHLY ADDRESSED ALL MY QUESTIONS.  I WILL GO SEE A NEUROLOGIST.

Pain management doctors refuse him, He has been told he need surgery but will not recommend at this time with no reason given. We need help for him. Thank you43532.7756944444 Perhaps I'm misunderstanding but it sounds like the treating physician is refusing to prescribe the treatment that the patient believes he/she needs.  What you need to understand is that the doctor is not going to be obligated to treat someone if the doctor doesn't wish to do so anymore than you would be obligated to work somewhere that you do not want to work.  Quite frankly I suspect that the doctor has his/her reasons for refusing to provide the pain meds but even if the doctor is simply being unreasonable there is nothing that you can do legally to force the doctor to treat you.  If you are dissatisfied with the care give then solution is to go to a different provider.43532.8305555556 Thanks 43537.7298611111 When I ordered my back my wheelchair.

Do I have right to sue?43537.0736111111 You do not have any damages from an economic legal standpoint so you cannot prevail in a lawsuit.

However two years later the ### water under the bridge."I do not understand the connection between the ###.

If you are seeking to hire an attorney for legal assistance there is a search function on the Missouri Bar web site here:  ###Best wishes.43567.6895833333 Don't assume that your old dentist will provide you with an affidavit.  Generally one has to get these from someone that practices in a different state a fair distance away as no healthcare provider wants to be talked about in the circle that they practice in as having provided support for a malpractice claim.  Not saying that your prior dentist definitely won't, just noting that it would be unusual if he did.Even if the repair is $### $50,### $5,### $10,### $###.  That is a losing proposition even if you win.You can certainly file a complaint with the Missouri Board of Healing ###.  I think that would be the correct place to submit the complaint as it covers all other healthcare provider complaints but it may be that dentists have their own governing board within the Missouri Department of Professional Registration.  You will simply need to get on their website and look around.  Note that these bodies often focus more on ethical type of violations as opposed to malpractice issues so I cannot say how likely they are to take action.  I do not know that the Missouri Department of Insurance will have much interest in a provider's potential malpractice claim as it doesn't really involve insurance.Like I said before I would get the necessary treatment first so that you have evidence of the true cost for damages purposes and to show the judge that the issue was real and not just an attempt to recoup some money.  Then I would file the small claims suit and shortly thereafter file any complaints with the Board of Healing ###, etc.43573.7819444444 I can probably get an expert's affidavit from the Dentist that made my ###. It is a new type and several Dentist that I've been to  since have ### the new material used. It's not $1000, now it's $###. I plan to get a quote from my prior dentist who lives far away.

I just don't know who to contact first.43573.7118055556 I had expected my ### to last years longer, and they should have. This is an expense that should not have occurred and I don't have or want to pay an out of pocket expense that I had no control over. I do not want any extra money, I just want to be put back in the position I was in when I went to see him. Thanks for your help. Sadly, ###43573.8097222222 I received new Dental coverage from united Health Care. So went to a new Dentist for a check up and cleaning. While talking to him, he suggested that a tooth be pulled and his lab could put another tooth on the partial for $75.  When I returned they had incorrectly put the tooth on the wrong side. They had said the LAB Tech. had heart problems. This happened appx. in July.  I have been to the Dentist numerous times since, as the partial did not work properly after that.  It does not function at all now, and I'm unable to chew. This is a ### type partial, I paid $### $###. Because your teeth need to be adjusted for upper and lower teeth to function properly, this is now effecting my lower partial. He quoted a $###. He has dropped the price down to $###. It appears now I may have to do something about the lower partial too. I am ###. My partial was in excellent condition prior to seeing this Dentist. I have all the documentation on the facts I list above. I use to be in the insurance business until I was sadly diagnosed with ###,, so I document facts well. It's very difficult to be put in this situation with minimal recourse. I know I can go to small claims which I would like to avoid if possible. I checked with legal aid and they don't handle this type of suit. Any help would be greatly appreciated.     43573.6409722222 The problem is that dental malpractice suits are seldom worth pursuing from a cost benefit standpoint.  The cost of pursuing a dental malpractice claim is going to be little different from the $50,### $1,000.  What attorney is going to be interested in a case where even if they win the expenses of litigation will likely exceed any damages award?If I were you I would go ahead and get the replacement upper partial and then sue in small claims court for the amount charged along with pain and suffering.  Hopefully you won't be required to provide an expert's affidavit with the case being in small claims court.43573.6701388889 Ms. Chase,I think the question you are asking is whether or not the discrimination was illegal.  Most discrimination is legal.  Discrimination is only illegal if there is a law or statute which makes it illegal.  If the particular facility was not suitable or equipped to admit and treat your daughter, it would likely have been perfectly appropriate to refuse to accept your daughter into the facility.  It would take a great deal of additional information and research to determine if, for example, there might have been an ### violation.I would suggest you confer with an attorney who handles ### claims to determine whether or not you have a claim, and whether or not it is worth pursuing.

Best wishes  ### ###"43575.9326388889  I found out via Mercy that I had ### ###â€™s services insurance to a point. Working with planned parenthood and mercy, I ### up having a procedure done. ### County Hospital performed a procedure on me, yet I have records stating MULTIPLE procedures that are NOT covered, yet nobody in the building can tell me what they actually did to me. It was supposed to be a safe, routine procedure. Since then Iâ€™ve found on my own that theyâ€™ve not only have ###, but now Medicaid has literally approved and denied within one week the same issue. The multiple codes are accompanied by a ### laboratory ### from Medical Laboratory Services, also knowing that thy falsified records the provider has ceased contact with me, unless they sent collection agencies. Iâ€™ve got all of this subject matter recorded in black and white as well. I lit rally feel like Iâ€™m being punished for being a female. I had a biopsy that I KNEW about to diagnose at ### and ### pathology, it was coded correctly, never had any issue. Now this Laboratory is ruining whatâ€™s left of my life, when they canâ€™t even tell me why the biopsy occurred on the date of services (with multiple codes) or what said biopsy was for, ### theyâ€™d already diagnosed the issue with a covered biopsy. I had no knowledge of this biopsy. Had I known, I never ### had any services provided had they not told me it was 100% covered service, especially when they found I had cervical cancer progressing. Now Iâ€™ve had the surgery, theyâ€™ve ruined my body, Iâ€™m not covered to receive any follow up care of any sorts, and they simply refuse to acknowledge anything regarding the procedure(s) that occurred that day. I also had my mother there, just in case anything went wrong, they were to consult before removal of ANYTHING other than what we had discussed, and clearly that is not what occurred. I picked up my medical records ASAP from hospital, showed a full ### occurred. Also, providers website stated a partial ### occurred. The office that performed this stated I had to sign and wait for my records in the mail. The records received in the mail state that a simple ### (what I was told) occurred. Iâ€™m scared of this place now, Iâ€™m stuck with horrific side effects due to the lack of service from said provider, and theyâ€™re attempting to cover all of this up stating itâ€™s my fault, my responsibility, when I did everything I was supposed to do correctly. The provider is the one that lied about coverage, procedures occurred, and Laboratory service. The initial ### was absolutely fine, UNTIL the place that performed the surgery got involved. This has not only ruined my marriage, but how I feel about myself as a female. I literally have no clue what they did, and couldnâ€™t possibly have consented to anything because I was completely under anesthesia.43592.85625 I never said that you should get an attorney pro bono as no medical malpractice lawyer is going to take on an entire case pro bono.  Personal injury lawsuits including medical malpractice cases are typically handled on a contingency fee basis.  What that means is that the attorney agrees to handle your case in exchange for receiving some percentage of the amount of the settlement or jury verdict.  A common percentage fee in a medical malpractice is 40%.  So no, the lawyer is not doing it pro bono but rather on a fee basis where he/she does not get paid unless you win and the amount of the fee is based upon the amount of the recovery.Incidentally, ### of the bladder is a known possible complication of that surgery so I doubt that you have a viable case if it is simply based upon that but a careful review of the medical records is necessary to make a full determination.The reason that you need an expert outside of ### (and likely outside of Missouri) is not that they all work for the University but rather than no local doctor is likely to testify against a fellow doctor in their local community.I suggest that you try speaking with some medical malpractice attorneys about representing you on a contingent fee basis.43670.6770833333 If you canâ€™t afford an attorney to represent you in your medical malpractice case then you certainly canâ€™t afford a medical expert to evaluate it and testify. Typically medical malpractice cases are handled by attorneys on a contingency fee basis meaning that it doesnâ€™t cost you anything as the attorney gets paid out of the recovery. Of course you will have a difficult time getting an attorney to represent on that basis if the case isnâ€™t any good but in that case you arenâ€™t going to be able to pursue it on your own effectively either. No medical expert will bother to review your medical records without getting paid to do so up front. And you will have to have that expert testify at trial as well which will be even more expensive. The cost of an expert in a medical malpractice case is thousands of dollars hence my initial statement that if you canâ€™t afford a lawyer you certainly canâ€™t afford a medical expert. Incidentally, you will have to look for an expert that isnâ€™t merely unaffiliated with the university but most likely outside of Missouri in order to get them to testify. 43669.9902777778 So my only recourse is finding an attorney to do it pro bono? Wow our justice system is really stacked in favor of the rich and huge corporations like the university. Can you refer me to an attorney in ### that has it in them to take on the university? Also, why would I need a medical expert outside of ###? Do all of the experts in this town work for the university??? 43670.0381944444 The university of missouri hospital ### my bladder during a bladder ### surgery last March .

Is he not attempting to extort us? 43693.0291666667 I repeat, you are doing your daughter a disservice by handling this yourselves.  You don't hire an attorney after unsuccessfully negotiating it yourself and needing to file suit - you hire an attorney to negotiate it from the beginning.  And just to be clear, I stopped doing PI work over a decade ago so it is not like I am trying to drum up business.  I'm merely advising you that unrepresented parties settlements are substantially below that which are obtained by represented parties.While I can appreciate the provider's concerns about submitting billing that is not what was actually charged that is not going to keep the provider from having to pay punitive damages for failing to turn over the medical records and bills.  The provider can submit the medical bills for the full amount reflecting that you have only paid X amount or the provider can submit bills simply reflecting the amount actually paid.  What the provider cannot do is require you to pay anything else before releasing the records and bills other than the very minimal charges set out by law for the cost of the records.43693.6229166667 My daughter was in a car accident and we took her to ### Chiropractic Clinic Mid ### for treatment for her soft tissue injuries after her facial fracture had healed.

We explained and got verification from the claims representative with the insurance company that they would accept it that a note could be attached to the records stating she was seen at the clinic and did not pay the full amount listed on the records but paid a discounted student rate. He refused and said he would not release the records until we paid the difference in price. Understand ###ing is not even offered  this is a clinic and payment in FULL is REQUIRED at the time of service. I have every receipt. I furnished my insurance coverage on our first visit but used a student account instead per the staff's advice because it cost less. I have never received any ### my insurance was never ###ed and the office says we have a ZERO balance. He is basically saying we don't owe any money unless we want the records sent so that way the amount the records show we paid will match the actual amount we paid. I have no idea what the records say we paid but we paid $### $### ### $###. I understand that a search fee and a per page fee can be charged for the record up to a specified amount.

If she has had injuries such as you described then she will struggle with problems when she gets older. Trust me, I assumed I would be fine after hurting my back at work in college but now have to be careful or be laid up for days. To answer your question yes the provider is obligated to provide your daughter with her records and bills.

I am supposed to be sedated during these procedures, however during my last procedure I vividly remember waking up and feeling a needle go into my neck. When I tried to raise my arms and head to stop the doctor the nurses held my arms down and told me to stop moving. This was very traumatic for me and I am experiencing more pain than before I underwent this procedure. I am wondering if I have a case against this doctor for my pain and suffering. 43753.725 I'm in an 8+yr relationship (he comes and goes as he pleases. I ### put him on my deed) with someone whose mental health is on a very rapid decline (due to ### drug usage encouraged by his parents). Since the middle of the summer, he's had several stays in the local mental health unit, once involuntarily per his doctor at the drug treatment center. A couple weeks ago I tried to have law enforcement take him to the hospital on a Sunday because he was threatening my life, his father's life and to commit suicide. I stayed in a hotel while local law enforcement took him to his parents house just a few blocks away from the house. He has the local p.d. thinking he is always a victim, never the aggressor. He took himself to the hospital late Monday afternoon. At approximately ### that Mon night I received a phone call from ###" at the hospital to inform me that he'd made a very specific threat to my life and she said she was legally obligated to contact me but because of the privacy laws couldn't tell me much more than that. I confirmed that he was in the mental unit the next morning (Tuesday).  I thought that Missouri had a manditory ###??? Needless to say I was very surprised when the mental unit RELEASED HIM BEFORE NOON ON WEDNESDAY and I get a call from my house phone from him that afternoon making veiled threats again (He'd broken in a window AGAIN but local p.d. tells him he can do that). This past Monday at approximately ### he'd started making threats to strangers at a local business (not the first time doing that but the charges were dropped on it & he only has the assault on me from the previous time) i got him out of there and was driving home.

While you could sue for medical negligence, unless you suffered thousands of dollars or additional medical expenses as a result of the harm done or it a doctor will opine that your son will need long ### treatment, it wonâ€™t make sense for an attorney to invest thousands or tens of thousands of dollars or her time in filing suit on a contingency basis.  Likewise, even if you have that amount of extra money sitting around, it wonâ€™t make financial sense for you to pay an attorney hundreds of dollar per hour to litigate the case.  Plus, youâ€™d likely have to pay a medical expert witness $500+ per hour.   Unfortunately, the legal system is terribly expensive. 43772.8291666667 What legal action can be taken against access care clinic for medical ### of my ###?They blew both veins one in each arm while ### him down to a board, then sat there milking his finger for more blood, my son ### puked while they were doing this all over and she just kept milking his finger of blood instead of stopping and allowing him a break, the other nurse was suppose to be helping but she wasent she was laughing and talking with someone else, so we had to sit there for at least ###. It was the most traumatizing blood draw I've ever witnessedI then returned to the exam room with my traumatized son his Primary care physician did nothing about the situation and he stated that he didnt know what to say! He also admitted to avoiding me for a months time about my sons health and not calling me back. The  lab techs also knew my son had a bit of food in his mouth and still continued to strap him in making him choke and they weren't stopping to set him up and check on him the just kept going only caring about getting the blood at any cost43763.7159722222 ### you so much. I will contact her father in the morning. Will find out my information tomorrow then contact you and let you know.43768.3048611111 Either your daughter isnâ€™t being truthful or she misunderstood. She can be placed on a ###. They canâ€™t do anything beyond that without a court order or the patientâ€™s permission. If the hospital attempts to have her committed an attorney will be appointed to represent her interests. The notion that someone would assert that a patient was going to be in a facility for two years is absurd as it isnâ€™t possible to assess how long someone would need that level of treatment. Additionally neither an insurance company nor Medicaid will be willing to pay for in-patient treatment for that length of time. 43768.2361111111 My daughter got into a car wreck on Saturday night and was admitted to the hospital. During her intake the nurse asked her if she has ever thought about committing suicide and she replied yes but not for a long time. She was then asked if she would ever act out on it and she said no. She was informed tonight by a doctor that they were taking over power of attorney over her and that they were locking her up in a psych ### for ###. My question is can they legally lock her up when she has never even tried to commit suicide. She has only thought about it when she is depressed. Also what legal rights does she have? 43768.0951388889 My ### ###. All said ok and was only supposed to get two but ended up getting ###. I became alarmed and spoke with her doctor afterwards who didnâ€™t seem concerned and said it was in her best interest. I did sign the form but felt I was rushed because my child saw the needles and they were already putting her on the table to give her the shots so I hurriedly signed because she was already crying. I realized that she was given the flu shot after her doctor confirmed she did even though they all knew I did not want her to have it. She only had soreness and ### from it but I made it very clear that it was not to be given. I felt like it was snuck in on purpose. Her doctor feels strongly about it. I left and called the office and spoke with the acting supervisor crying and she agreed that it shouldnâ€™t have been given. Do I have any case with this? Thank you. 43775.7527777778 You would have to prove damages which you cannot so it is not worth pursuing in my opinion.  Feel free to call around and speak to local medical malpractice attorneys but I suspect that they will take the same position.43775.7784722222 My daughter is mentally disabled. Iâ€™m legal guardian.

Sheâ€™s on monthly disability and Medicaid and resides at a habilitation center?43783.6194444444 You should consider setting up a Special Needs Trust. That will provide for your daughter while not interfering with her Medicaid or disability. An attorney can help draft it and answer whether you can be a beneficiary.43794.8909722222 I am unemployed and do not receive Disability, but my Medicaid application (for MO Healthnet) has been approved and retroactively covers all my medical ###s.  I have no income at all (a friend pays my monthly ###s).  I've had no problem with Medicaid or with getting any of my medical ###s paid except for one ### from ### County Medical Center, located in ###, ###. Over the summer, I attempted suicide (by overdosing on prescription pills) while traveling through ### and was transported by ambulance to the hospital for ### measures.  After being ###ed for the treatment, I sent them my Medicaid information.  They refused to ### Medicaid, however, stating they do not ### out of state providers and have signs all over the hospital stating such.  (I was unresponsive when brought in and, though I was awake by the time I was discharged, I barely remember even being at the ### I certainly didn't see any signs nor was I in any condition to seek treatment elsewhere.) Anyway, since the hospital wouldn't ### Medicaid, they sent me the health insurance claim forms (already filled out) with instructions for me to send them to MO Healthnet.  The hospital representative said Medicaid would pay me, but I would have to be the one to pay the hospital.  I sent them into MO Healthnet.  Medicaid refused to pay and sent the hospital instructions for enrolling in their program.  A representative from MO Healthnet told me the hospital need only enroll to collect payment; but, if they won't enroll, Medicaid won't pay.   That same representative suggested I seek a debt ### because most hospitals offer those.  I filled out the appropriate papers for the hospital, but my application was denied as soon as I turned it in because they only give financial aid to (###) people who are residents of their county or (###) people who have seen one of their medical doctors at least twice before being treated at the hospital.So here I am: unemployed but medically insured; yet, possessing a hospital ### I can't pay and no one seemingly willing to help.  I feel I've exhausted all my options.

When I arrived in my room, the male nurse told me that it was protocol for him to be in the room while I Dress into my gown. I later found out that it in fact was not protocol to watch me dress into my gown so I feel sexually harassed. The doctor then came in my room and told me that an X-ray on my face would be too expensive, sent me on my way with a broken ### and a concussion. Really I donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s broken or out of place because an X-ray wasnâ€™t performed on me. I tried to set an appointment with an eyes, ears and ### doctor because I donâ€™t have insurance so I donâ€™t wanna keep getting billed to go to different hospitals, not realizing that the appointment I made was expensive as well. Iâ€™m just stuck and I feel like I was done wrong and need legal advice or if itâ€™s even worth going to court for neglect and sexual harassment 43796.7354166667 Ms. ###,Since you were uncomfortable with the presence of the male nurse, refusing to undress until he left or asking for a supervisor would have been appropriate.  Apparently you have reviewed the hospital's protocols, and determined the ### actions violated hospital policy.  Did you see any exceptions in the hospital's policy?   Since you had a head injury and were diagnosed with a concussion, it might  have been required that you not be left you alone in the ER room.   I assume you filed a complaint with the hospital after your visit about the male nurse?  If you did not, you should still do this to address your complaint about the nurse.  But the ### presence would not fit the definition of sexual harassment or merit a legal action.  (If you haven't already done so) follow up with the hospital and perhaps the Mo. Board of Nursing about the particular nurse:  ###You indicated you have no health insurance.  Very generally speaking, the hospital was only required to take such action as the ER doctor determined was medically necessary to ### your injuries.  I assume you did not offer to pay for the X-ray or other tests or treatment at St. ### ER at the time.  It does not appear that St. ### was negligent based on what you wrote.  You were released and needed to go to follow up with your own doctor or specialist concerning the nose injury.  Lacking insurance, it is your obligation to pay for these services.  Hospitals have limited obligations to  uninsured, non-paying patients.If you believe you have a claim to pursue, you should hire an attorney for advice and possible representation.  However your time and money would probably be better spent for a follow-up with an ENT specialist for examination and any needed treatment.  Best wishes.43806.2652777778 In Missouri the statute of limitations for medical malpractice cases is very short. Specifically, two years from the date of the surgery. There are certain limited exceptions but nothing that seems ### from the facts which you have provided.I strongly suggest that you contact a medical malpractice plaintiffâ€™s attorney in order to have your case evaluated. If you choose to do so you should do so promptly as there is already a very good chance it is too late for you to pursue this matter. You do not want to delay and then find that had you acted sooner you would have been able to pursue the case.43802.8888888889 That criminal case really had nothing to do with your case so even if he had been convicted you would still have had to prove that the doctor's treatment of you was below the standard of care and that as a result you were injured.  The fact that it was ultimatley dropped does not really impact your ability to pursue the case. The real issue is whether or not you are beyond the statute of limitations to pursue a case against the doctor.  Even if you had a video of this doctor detailing in excruciating detail the numerous ways in which he violated the standard of care intentionally in order to be able to charge you more for treatment it wouldn't matter if it is too late to file suit.  The medical lobby is quite powerful and has successfully lobbied to limit the statute of limitations for doctors to a strict two (###) years from the date of negligent treatment.  The court's have interpreted the statute to not start running during the time period that you are still seeing the doctor in follow up care to the surgery, etc. So if it has been more than two (###) years since you had your last follow up to the surgery it is going to be too late to file suit.  There are a couple of exceptions in the statute such as if the doctor left something in your body during the surgery (typically a ###) then the statute starts to run when you first knew, or should have known, of the item having been left behind after the surgery.  That does not appear to be the case here from what you have described.All of these other things that you are asking about have no bearing to the case if you cannot get past the statute of limitations issue.  I haven't handled medical malpractice cases in over a decade so its possible that there may be available avenues to pursue the matter of which I am not aware.  That is why I mentioned before, if you want to pursue the matter then you need to contact a plaintiff's attorney that handles medical malpractice cases to discuss it with them.  Most such attorneys handle such cases on a contingency fee basis so it won't cost you anything to make an appointment to get your questions answered.  43802.9576388889 case aginst doctorThis doctor put hardware (metal) in my back when none was needed after a accedent i had. he had interest in the company or his wife did that sell the metal. they found him guilty.

I can also appreciate how difficult and frustrating it must be if you canâ€™t get needed meds for your condition. However the paperwork you submitted doesnâ€™t indicate that you are being denied access to care as it specifically states that you have an appointment scheduled with a Dr. ### ### on ###.Additionally, there is no provision within the medical system by which it can put a black ### against a patient receiving care. The electronic chart does allow for a doctor to note possible drug seeking efforts but not the denial of care overall. In looking at what you provided, there are two different medications that are listed twice which could have raised a question as to possible drug seeking behavior so perhaps that is what the doctor was referring to. What you need to understand is that notations in your chart for possible drug seeking efforts isnâ€™t illegal but in fact the proper standard of medical care.I have a daughter whose mental health issues are far more serious than my own. When she is struggling she often misinterprets what she is being told as offensive or ###.  This of course leads to her becoming even more distressed. If you are not currently taking needed medications it may be that you have misinterpreted what this person meant when he/she made the comment about a â€œ### on my chart keeping me from getting any help from a mercy doctor in my area.â€I applaud you for not ignoring your issue and actively seeking efforts to obtain needed medical care. Far too often folks donâ€™t pursue the care they need leading to very sad outcomes. Allow me to offer a couple of comments or suggestions that may help you. First, your appointment in February is with what looks to be an ### rather than a psychiatrist. I strongly suggest that you get care for mental health issues from a psychiatrist. Second, if you are unable to travel to a doctorâ€™s office for care it may be possible to obtain care via Tele-medicine. There are multiple providers now that can see you and prescribe medications just by speaking with you on the phone through an app on your smartphone. Good luck and keep taking care of yourself!43861.7145833333 Hi ###,I am sorry you are in this predicament. Unfortunately, the insurance companyâ€™s denial may be legal.  If you had purchased an ACA compliant health insurance policy, this would not be legal, but short ### policies are not real health insurance and do not have to comply with the ACA. You need to get a copy of your policy and see if it says it is ACA compatible or if it specifically states it is short ### coverage and does not meet the requirements of the ACA.Also an ACA compliant policy can NOT deny claims based on pre-existing conditions but a short ### policy can.  These are some of the reasons why the costs are so different.To answer your second question, if the policy is a true ACA health insurance policy, then you can report them  to the Missouri Department of Insurance.  You can find their information here:  https://insurance.mo.gov/consumers/complaints/The other bad news is that you are responsible for the medical bills for treatment you received.  If your insurance company does not end up having to pay this claim for the reasons set out above, you are responsible.  However, you can and should ask the hospital for a discount.  You might also qualify for their charity care program.  They may also accept payments over time.In the future be sure to read the fine print on any insurance policy you buy and if the price on a policy is a lot lower rememberer there is likely a good reason.Please feel free to call me at my office at ###-### if you have additional questions.Good luck,### ###The ### Law FirmPerryville, MO43876.0861111111 In December of ###0###8, I made a visit to the ER. At the time, I was on a short-term insurance plan from an insurance company called ###. Due to the need for a cat-scan, the final ### of the ER was $6,4###3.###0. I had a deductible of only $###,###. However, without getting into the specifics that would take too many words, the ### Company/Group didn't just turn down payment, they refused to talk to either me or the Hospital at all past a certain point. They initially asked for some information from both myself and the hospital, which was provided (multiple times in the Hospital's case), then they stalled for months claiming they were 'seeking more information about pre-existing conditions in order to make a determination.' Eventually, they came back to demands from both me and the hospital claiming that:Good Afternoon. The claim in question is closed for pre-existing review. The plan has not yet been able to make a benefit determination on the claim. We did receive the requested information from you and from the member it is currently being reviewed. Due to the large volume of information that is received daily the reviews are processed in the order that they were received. Once all correspondence is reviewed we will determine benefits and issue a new explanation of benefits. If you require further assistance please contact a live customer service agent at ### Monday-Friday 8:00AM-8:00PM EST. Thank you for contacting customer service." Except that that was on ###. I never got a new EoB and neither did the Hospital. The Hospital continued to pursue payment from them until January of this year. At which time they said that since the insurance company had refused to provide any information beyond that response no matter what they tried that there was nothing more that they could do and I was personally on the hook for the entire ###. No adjustments even.From my perspective there seems like there can be no way that this is legal. For the insurance company to simply stonewall until the hospital gives up. Unfortunately in this case I don't even know what sort of legal assistance to look for. Given the sheer amount of time stress anxiety and financial pressure this has put on me I'm very much ready to pursue legal action against the insurer at this point. But I don't know where to even start. I supposed in essence there are two interconnected questions here.###) Is what the insurance company did in fact illegal?and###) What sort of legal assistance should I look for?

Iâ€™ve got written proof from a medical professional  stating that having all my teeth removed is a medically necessity. My mouth is full of infection and it effects every organ in my body. Iâ€™m not going to walk around with no teeth. Denture isnâ€™t a good solution, although cheaper,  they arenâ€™t going to give me anymore confidence ( my moms fall out while she is talking all the time) they are nothing but a temporary fix, not to mention implant supported dentures allows the ### to fuse to the implants. If nothing is there your jaw slowly deteriorates causing your face to sink in. If I was 75+ Iâ€™d opt for dentures... but Iâ€™m only in my ###.... there is still so many possibilities in my future. no health net hasnâ€™t technically DENIED the services but Iâ€™ve talked to Missouri care and Iâ€™ve talked with the new provider they have. Both say the same thing. They donâ€™t cover it... they DO cover medically necessary.. I can not function in life right now. My toothaches are debilitating, and I wonâ€™t speak to anyone in person.. this has to be medically necessary!! Please give me a direction to go in!!43886.7263888889 Dear Mr. ###,I am responding because your post will drop off unanswered soon, and you likely will not receive any other reply. You apparently have multiple complex issues, and I hope you are receiving satisfactory assistance.  This site is for asking specific civil law questions.  What you are seeking is an opinion as to whether or not you have the legal basis for a lawsuit.  It is not clear from what you wrote that there is or is not litigation is worth pursuing.  In order to have an attorney evaluate a possible lawsuit and agree to provide representation, you are going to need to actually confer with the attorney and review the history in depth.  The opinion of any volunteer attorney on this forum is really of no value, since the attorney will not be handling your alleged claim.The home health agency refused to continue providing services, and appears to have provided you with the required notice.  I would expect that the agency has a very different version of what occurred. Even if there is the basis for a lawsuit, which I doubt, it is highly unlikely that you will find an attorney willing to accept the case on a contingency basis.  If you are willing to pay the attorney on an hourly basis the chances might be greater.  The cost of attorney's fees could exceed the potential value of your claim.It is difficult to determine what sort of lawsuit you believe you have, if any.  All I can suggest is that you contact attorneys in your area, and get a definitive evaluation.  The cost of an initial consultation is usually modest.  Although the best recommendations often come from satisfied family or friends, the Missouri Bar has an attorney search function here: https://mobar.org/public/LawyerSearch.aspxBest wishes.43914.8194444444 I also have other docs I wanted to attach to this question but I could not send all of them.

Made the comment that we talked to you about getting implants.  I did not want/no could I afford implants.  He then asked if I still had my old dentures I replied yes.  He said to wear those and walked out of the room.  I'm being bombarded with calls from the finance company on a daily basis for payment.   I contacted ### Dental Management Inc. at ADMI (### Dental Management Inc} Attn: Patient Satisfaction - 0873 P. O.

She also has several other disabilities including autism and other developmental delays. She is able to live independently but with supports. Unfortunately, in ###. Prior to discharge, she was connected with a Dr. ### ###, the owner/operator of an organization called The Community Counseling and Housing Services. His CEO/partner, ### ###, came to the hospital to pick her up. She had her sign papers releasing her to their agency's care and that same day they moved her in to one of their many group homes in the St. ### area. He said he would ensure she would receive proper care to include psychiatric treatment, drug counseling and treatment, group counseling sessions and other therapies to help her get well. He did not.I got suspicious after a well check and saw her living conditions. I reached out to Dr. ### to ask about his credentials. He became extremely defensive. After a bit of back and forth" he hung up on me. Representatives from my daughter's agency supports became ### of him also after he refused to provide them his credentials necessary for them to ensure he would be a good fit for my daughter's care team. They were also ### because she receives social security income and has Medicaid and Medicare.I started researching him and his operations and found him to be a scam. Several articles have been written about his schemes the most recent one details my story at: www.stltoday.com.I found:Dr. ### is not a medical professional. He has an Ed.D. from Lindenwood University.He is not ###. The Missouri ### Board has not renewed his Drug Counselor license. He is operating a new business CenterPointe. The website states they offer In Patient and psychiatric services.He is not licensed by The State of Missouri (Dept. of ###; DMH) to operate group homes and the homes were not certified by the City of St. ### nor St. ### County. He falsified my daughter's lease agreement. She never signed it nor reviewed it.  After ###.stltoday.com he shut down his website for The Community Counseling and Housing Services  https://www.tcchs.us/contact He is still being investigating for future articles. This is a link to one of them https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/tony-messenger/messenger-nonprofit-s-sober-living-houses-come-with-a-catch/article_8530603affb94f2a83b5-7f6b-5a48-9bdc-.html He misrepresented his credentials. He fraudulently advertised services to entice her to choose him for treatment and she chose him based on his claim to be certified in these areas. He called himself "Dr." in a way to appear as a medical professional. He assured his ability to treat the complexities of her diagnoses as there are many. Instead he has done more harm. Since leaving his home her drug habit has worsened and she is homeless. And...Disabled! Most of all she is my daughter and she is loved.Is there a case and what type of an attorney would I reach out to?"43907.0854166667 I recieved a called today from child protective services stating that I was ### last week for leaving my son in the hospital for several days. My son is mentally ill I am his legal guardian. His was taken to progress west hospital by ambulance for jumping out of my car. They told me they would be keeping him and try to find a bed for admitting at a psych hospital. I was in communication with the nurse the doctor and the social worker at the hospital. I never left my son. On ###th I spoke with his doctors at wash university they told me they had been in contact with the doctors at and staff at progress west and advised me he was to remain in the hospital until a bed became available for him. Around ### talk to you I said excuse me what do you mean she then goes on a rant talking about he was suppose to be discharged this morning by our psych staff doctor I said right but Dr Constantino spoke with you guys and said that would not be best or appropriate for him he needs to be admitted. So she then goes to say he doesnâ€™t have any authority here at our hospital I asked her why is she telling me all of this she needs to be addressing him she stated I have been calling Dr ### he gave me his personal cell I said well call him and tell him that they told me he is not coming home and he is awaiting a bed. She then threatens to hotline me to DMH she stated if I feel heâ€™s not safe to be at home because they are having a hard time finding bed for him. Fast forward today I get call saying I was ### for leaving my son in the hospital for several days. But I have discharge papers I picked him up. I want to file a lawsuit for false reporting from a healthcare provider my son is mentally ill and disabled and I am passed emotionally drained with failed healthcare professionals not wanting to having any empathy for mentally ill. Itâ€™s doctors notes from correspondence with his doctors and their staff doctor and nurses. So why would a nurse maliciously file a false report of neglect to Child protected services43907.7055555556 Ms. ###,I offer no opinion as to whether or not you have the basis for a lawsuit.  But if that's what you want to do you'll need to hire an attorney for advice and representation.  If the hotline complaint is still pending, you should have an attorney assist you in responding to the state agency.  I assume you've already filed a formal complaint with the hospital.  It's possible there was simply a lack of communication, and perhaps even a mandated report involved.   Mandated reporters are generally granted civil and criminal immunity, with some exceptions.  See:  https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=210.135&bid=11308&hl=Unless you're willing to pay the attorney hourly, you may have difficulty finding an attorney to handle this for you.  Even if there is a basis for a lawsuit, the damages would be minimal.  A contingency fee arrangement would be very unlikely.

Fast forward to ###$8959.00.   My sister, who has both medical and financial POA for me, went to a local branch of my bank (Central Bank of the Midwest) and had a cashier's check drawn up for $9,###.   This check was presented to BG who apparently did not endorse it, and subsequently the check was returned.   BG has not returned the check to me or my family but only a photocopy of it along with the letterhead of BGs bank.   What are my rights here?   Then BG went and added a bunch of extra charges to the account after this, things that are ridiculous such as charging us $### 9.### $### 24.5mile trip to Meadowbrook Hospital in ### KS.   I was also charged $### (device called a halo") that I never asked for or never consented to.So my question is:  what are my rights here?   Can i tell BG they get nothing until I get the check back so I can get my ### back?   Can I deny the additional add on charges that are ridiculous and that I never consented to?   Can I simply walk away and say I did my part (presented payment) and they didn't do theirs (properly ### the check).I have attached redacted copies of the check return statement and a redacted copy of my account statement."43938.6569444444 Hi ###,Let me see if I can clear up some of your confusion about the TRICARE eligibility rules for former spouses.A former spouse is eligible for TRICARE if either:(###) your ex-spouse has at least ###; you were married to the same service member for at least ###; and all ### ### (Active or Reserve) service which counted towards your sponsor's retirement.or(###) your ex-spouse has at least ###; you were married to the same service member for at least ###; and ### ### (Active or Reserve) service which counted towards your sponsor's retirement.In the case of this second scenario, your coverage eligibility is determined by the date your marriage ended, not the date of your marriage.  It is only the case that if your marriage ended before ###, that you would be fully eligible for TRICARE.  If your marriage ended after ###, you would have one year of TRICARE eligibility from the date of divorce.So, if your marriage to the service member was over ### ###, you are eligible.  If the service member was only engaged in creditable service for over ###5, but less than ###0, of the years in which you were married, you would only have one year of TRICARE eligibility from the date of your divorce.A former spouse can also lose their TRICARE eligibility if they remarry, or purchase and are covered by an employer-sponsored health plan.Hope this helps.43901.7388888889 Hi, i am a divorcee of a service member.

Also, does your sister have a spouse or adult child who might be considered next of kin?43948.6819444444 My sister has been in ### Hospital and is unresponsive. We have been getting tests & they have been maintaining her care in addition they gave us ###.  We selected the course of action that ### life and since we made that selection they have not honored our choice. The MedICU team gave direction that we were just waiting on the scheduling for the trach/peg to be implemented but we were later told the surgical team denied the surgery.

We ended up speaking with the ethics team representative; we ended the meeting with the understanding that they would look to facilitate other opportunities via transfer so we were awaiting feedback. As we are awaiting the charting system to be updated with feedback from the other hospitals I found out that the ethics team instituted a DNR code if anything transpires; which we ### DISAGREE with.

Does someone have a Health Care Power of Attorney for your aunt?  Has your aunt signed an advanced directive?  She could have signed these at some time in the past or when she was admitted in the hospital.  These documents are often required before being admitted.  If she has signed an advanced directive this might have precidence over your desires.   If she has signed the POA then the person she has designated would have the final say if that is not you.  What you want now may ot matter if she has signed one or both of these documents.  If she has not signed any docuements then you need to find out why they have instituted a DNR.   This is not normal procedure at most hospitals.  You need to find more information out to determine why they are doing this. 43948.6805555556 Hi ###,It looks like your deadline has passed. I hope the information I provide may still be assistance to you in this case or in your future dealings with the medicaid disputes.In general, if you are dealing with an administrative agency, you won't be able to appeal through the state trial court. This may have been the cause of your frustrations trying to get information from Guilford County Superior Court.If you had a hearing on Medicaid before an Administrative Law Judge, that may have been through the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings.  More information on how to appeal a decision in that scenario can be found here: https://www.oah.nc.gov/hearings-division/medicaid-recipient-appeals/filing-contested-medicaid-recipient-appeal  If this is the case, there should have been a Medicaid Services Recipient Hearing Request Form included with your adverse decision.  You would need to fill this form out to appeal the decision.If you had a hearing on Medicare before an Administrative Law Judge, that would likely have been through the Department of Health and Human Resources.  More information on how to appeal a decision from an Administrative Law Judge can be found here: https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/omha/the-appeals-process/index.html I have attached the appeal form and the request for extension of time form to this message.Best of luck.44028.6208333333 My name is ### ###.

Please help us! 43929.5645833333 Good Saturday afternoon to you, Ms. Dearing:Thank you for this question.  You raise good questions here that merit a second, closer look by an experienced medical malpractice lawyer.  Of the many types of legal questions posted in an online forum like this, medical malpractice questions are often the hardest to answer with any certainty, since establishing a firm claim against a doctor or hospital requires a close inspection of all relevant medical records, along with ### facts not in the written record that the patient/client can provide the lawyer during an initial consultation.  While I cannot say for sure that you have a case, after reading your helpful fact summary, I do believe that your concerns are serious enough for you to earnestly pursue a consultation with legal counsel to precisely evaluate whether you have a claim, and if so, what its approximate monetary value is in light of pain and suffering, emotional distress, and (if applicable) reasonably anticipated future medical costs.  This is definitely something you should follow up on.Since you live in ### County, you are probably going to have to reach beyond your immediate local community, and consider reaching out to medical malpractice firms in ###, or beyond if you so desire.  I recommend going to ### and using the Find a Lawyer" tab near the top right of your screen.  Searching in the ### area (or in other NC towns or cities) look for lawyers under the practice area heading of "Medical Malpractice and you will see a ### of lawyers who handle cases similar to yours.  Some, though not necessarily all, medical malpractice lawyers offer ### free consultations.  Once you see a few that you find potentially desirable, call or email them and request a consultation.  Counsel will provide you with instructions as to the sharing of medical records and other materials to inform their guidance to you on a preliminary basis.Blessings and best wishes to you this spring.43946.7145833333 Had surgery last ###.

They never told me or my wife about the situation ###. I cant remember anything from my time in the hospital. I went in for a liver biopsy and had issues with pain. The last thing I remember was being put to sleep for the procedure. Do I possibly have a claim?43945.1263888889 Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  This is too brief a factual summary to know, even from a perspective of preliminary conjecture, whether medical negligence occurred.  I do not see anything here that automatically means the doctor or the hospital would be at fault, but again, I also cannot tell from just four lines whether that is can be confirmed.  Your best bet is to search for North ### medical malpractice lawyers in or around the ### area, and ask for an initial consultation (probably ###, after the lawyer has been mailed or emailed pertinent medical records).  Once a medical malpractice lawyer has reviewed the facts with you and has inspected the medical records, s/he will have a better sense of whether a claim should be asserted, and if so, what the monetary value of that claim likely is.You can search on ### using the Find a Lawyer" feature searching under the practice area of "Medical Malpractice in whatever NC town or city you desire in localizing your search results.  I hope you can obtain a more precise, definite opinion on this important matter once you have had the benefit of discussion with counsel.Blessings and best wishes to you, your wife, and your respective families during this present pandemic.  Good health, safety, financial stability and peace of mind to you all.43945.2631944444 First, I am very sorry for what you have been through.  With regard to finding an attorney, I can advise that you contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association.  You can find out how to contact them through the website of the NC Bar Association or by calling ###.  There is a description of the program on the website.  You can be directed to an attorney who can provide a limited consultation, which might assist you in finding an attorney to consider your potential claim.What I can do if it is helpful, is provide some general information about the law applying to professional negligence.  To successfully pursue a professional negligence claim in NC, one must prove that the healthcare provider did not comply with the applicable standards of practice, which basically means that they did not meet the minimum standards of behavior that is required in a particular circumstance.  In order to prove that, other professionals in the same field have to testify as to what these standards are and that they were violated by the professional in question.  It also is required that an expert witness testify that the outcome would have been different if the standards of practice had not been violated.  These experts also testify to the extent of any injury caused and what it costs to treat the injury.The need for these experts is why attorneys have to retain expert witnesses as part of a case.  I wish you well in finding an attorney.  There are other avenues to have the care of individuals investigated, such as licensing boards.  They do not assist with compensation, but they do investigate issues with regard to the professionals that they license.I wish you well in obtaining an attorney or arranging a settlement with the involved party if you are able to do that without an attorney.  A consultation with an attorney through the Lawyer Referral Service mentioned above may help you explore these options.  I cannot provide you with legal advice about statute of limitations deadlines in this limited setting.  But I can generally make you aware of a NC law that provides that a lawsuit related to an injury caused by negligence must be filed within three years of the negligent conduct and injury.  An attorney must be consulted well in advance of that deadline in order to comply and also for the attorney alert you of the precise deadline in your case and whether some other deadline might apply.  Good luck to you. 43952.7069444444 I have been dealing with dental malpractice and have reached out to ###. However, due to a law that passed in ###, they said they take on very few medical cases. They have told me that I have a very strong case. I have much evidence of fault and even the medical office has in a way admitted fault but they don't want to give fair compensation. Also, because of their error and lack of communication, I have further ### needing to be done. So far I have paid $10,###. How can I get justice? Thank you!43951.8 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  Any de###ination of medical malpractice requires a lawyer's careful review of all medical records, in addition to any facts that you might have to share about what you experienced in the course of your care.  We cannot in a forum such as this tell you with certainty whether malpractice happened, since that ### a very specific legal definition that does not necessarily apply when non-lawyers use that ###.  To prove malpractice, a plaintiff/patient essentially has to establish that the care s/he received fell below the standard of a physician exercising reasonable care, as defined by the regular practices of that physician's local medical community--and that failure to meet that standard caused the injury of which the plaintiff/patient complains.  This is a very nuanced, careful analysis that a lawyer must work through based on the client's facts and the supporting medical records.While there might be a legal issue relating to the ### if the doctors administered ### that you expressly declined on behalf of the infant, and such ### were not required by law, but otherwise, I do not see anything here, at least at first glance, that suggests malpractice" as that ### is precisely defined by law.  However the only way to be certain one way or the other is to consult with a medical malpractice lawyer and share the pertinent records.Try searching for medical malpractice lawyers on ### using the "Find a Lawyer" feature near the top right of the screen.  Search under the NC city you desire and under the practice area heading "Medical Malpractice."  I hope you can soon find a good lawyer in this field who can offer you a more definite legal opinion based on review of the documentation.Blessings to you and your family during the Covid-###.

I also signed the paper work declining the immunizations for both my son and I, but they still gave me TET vaccine, MMR vaccine, and Varicella vaccine. I need to know what I should do about this issue I feel this is malpractice.43969.8569444444 I was seen in order to determine whether or not I had an illness that my loved one had just been tested for and was awaiting results . I was told after an inspection of my body that I did not have it and prescribed medicine for another issue , as well as sent to a Gynecologist. At the gynecologist I was told I did have the illness I inquired about originally , as well as the fact that I should not have been prescribed the medicine I was told to take because I am too young . I was also diagnosed with something at THIS doctor that I do not have , and actually took the medicine prescribed to me for no reason . In general I feel my concerns were originally ignored and as if I can just be prescribed any medication and told any number of things .

When I consulted with the orthodontist I held the belief that braces would fix my concern about my bite and also mastication (chewing). The orthodontist reassured me that this was a legit reason to go through with the treatment plan. Later on many months later... He said the whole purpose of the treatment was just cosmetic. This is not what he told me in the beginning. I felt very misled. If I had known it was just a cosmetic issue I would have not gotten the braces. I am mentally disabled and receive very low income. I am concerned that the orthodontist took advantage of me. I was misinformed and also he knew that I'm struggling. I returned later on after the braces were off for a follow-up regarding my retainers. I lost a front tooth due to a spontaneous trauma. I consulted with the orthodontist about my prognosis in which she said "The world will not come to an end." as my answer. I have talked this over in detail with my support system. My peer also agrees that the whole ordeal wasn't appropriate. My quality of life has been affected by this unfortunate dilemma. I lost a lot of money for no good reason.

Be well.44049.6034722222 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for asking this very important question on NC Free Legal Answers.  I can briefly address both aspects of your question, and provide a recommendation for initial consultation and discussion about any possible claims.First, all lawsuits (including those for medical malpractice) require proof of legal injury or harm; that appears to not be the case in your situation, but I am not sufficiently versed in the details of what happened to say that for certain.  To win in a medical malpractice, in a nutshell, you must show the following: (###) duty of care (usually based on a doctor-patient relationship or consultation; (###) breach of the standard of care; (###) causation; and (###) damages/harm.  The only way to know whether you satisfy all four (###) elements of medical negligence is to consult with a medical malpractice lawyer and share with him/her any and all pertinent documentation of your treatment.  Normally such a lawyer can give you a good idea of what options you might have once s/he has consulted with you at least once.Second, the type of person you would want to speak to is a medical malpractice lawyer (as mentioned in the first part).  I recommend your reaching out to ### ### of ###, who has handled medical malpractice and serious injury cases for around ###.  He is deeply versed in this area and would know whether you have a claim worth pursuing--whether through private negotiation, or litigation.  See his contact information below:https://www.cccattorneys.com/cfcI hope this will lead to a productive conversation.  At the very least, you can get a detailed review of your situation and what your legal options, if any, might be at this point.Blessings and best wishes to you and your family during the present pandemic.44048.8986111111 I am a long ### patient in an opiate maintenance treatment program called MMT or Methadone Maintenance Treatment and am currently seeing a provider in Wake County North Carolina. At the beginning of ### while ### in the clinic the nurse who dispenses the medication made a mistake and gave me ### my daily dose of 190MG's for a total ###'s of Methadone. In over ###, this has never happened to me, and I am unaware of it happening to anyone. The day it happened the facility came up short in their end of day inventory of medicine and was able to figure out who it happened to and called me that day to tell me what happened. They were obviously very concerned and actually called me hourly until ###. Luckily the amount of medicine taken was not fatal for me but easily could have been. If I had been killed I know my family would have had a good lawsuit on their hands but wanted to find out if they could be liable simply for putting my life in danger by making this mistake and if I could pursue a lawsuit. The second part of my question is if they do have some liability who should I contact or how do I proceed with filing the lawsuit or have an attorney you could recommend that might have dealt with something like this before. At this time I do not feel comfortable revealing the name of the company where this event took place and hope you can answer the question with that information. Thank you very much for your time and for reading/answering my question.44048.8034722222 Thank you very much for your prompt reply to my question and providing such a detailed answer. I will definitely reach out to Mr. ### to determine what options I may have going forward. Best Regards,Will44049.5347222222 Good morning, Liles:Thanks for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  I think you have included just the right degree of information at this preliminary stage of legal advice, and I thank you for taking the time to ### a thoughtful fact summary.  While I cannot say for sure after reading your post that this presents a strong dental malpractice case, I do think that the issues you raised here are serious enough to justify at least one consultation with a medical malpractice lawyer who handles dental malpractice, specifically.  During the consultation and probably just before, the lawyer will want to collect certain information from you that s/he can study in greater detail than is possible here, and get back with you with a precise legal opinion as to whether trying to settle privately with the dentist's malpractice insurance provider, or filing a lawsuit against the dental practice, is warranted.  The worst that can happen from such a follow-up inquiry is that the lawyer tells you that there is not enough fault or wrongdoing to warrant a medical malpractice claim.There are several good resources by which to vet potential ### for this matter.  You can go to ### and use the Find a Lawyer" feature and search for lawyers by NC town/city under the practice area of "Medical Malpractice"; note that you may want to search not only in Greensboro but also in other cities nearby (### and ### perhaps) to get a wider pool of legal talent in your search results.  Also consider inquiring with the Greensboro Bar Association and Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association for additional leads.I hope that you soon get the detailed feedback that you need for this important issue.  Blessings to you in health safety financial security and peace of mind during the present pandemic."44063.6645833333 Hello, thank you for helping. I had a dental procedure done late last year (root canal and crown). Within a couple months the crown fell off, and while waiting to get back in to the dentist to have it fixed, the tooth broke. The dentist who did this work told me there was no longer enough tooth for a repair and I'd have to get additional work that would cost me more money. I asked for them to give free service or a discount since their work failed, and they would only offer refund on the cost of the physical crown (they did eventually send this amount to me via the financing company I'd had to use for the original procedure).I talked with my insurance who advised asking the dentist to return the claim for the service, since I was only covered for one crown, but again the dentist declined to do this.I sent a patient remediation request for help to the NC Dental Society but they returned my request saying they don't have the legal authority for complaints involving dental costs/billing. They recommended I file a complaint with the NC attorney general, and I can still do this, but I wanted to know if I have any other legal recourse. I'm going to another dentist who is repairing my tooth, but this is additional money I'm having to pay that I wouldn't have to had the original dental work been done correctly.Sorry if this is too much info, I wasn't sure what to include. Thank you!44063.6 Hello, if I called the paramedics for a potential overdose, and she is admitted by ambulance to the ER and under ###, does the hospitals ### ### ### ? This patient has Tachycardia so she was admitted to the ICU the first day, the second day she was in the general care unit being heart monitored. At the ###, they Out of no where transferred her to ###H without serving her any papers from the Sheriff or anyone and physically forced her to go to ###. How and when does the ###? 44079.4166666667 I have been at a nursing / physical rehabilitation facility in Rich Square, North Carolina for about a month at the recommendation of the doctor at the local hospital. The reason I was recommended was muscle weakness, generalized weakness, and balance issues. About four or five days ago, I was getting out of the shower in my room and I slipped and fell right on the tile floor. There was/is no mat in the bathroom. I asked to go to the hospital for shoulder pain after the fall and was taken to the local emergency room. My shoulder is broken, my hip and knee are in pain, my chin and toes bruised, and I am having a harder time remembering things than I did before the slip. No alterations have been made to the bathroom since the slip. I am a medicare recipient and do not know much about the monetary costs, but I have been required to stay in the physical rehabilitation facility for ###. I am ###. I'm wondering if I have a case.44089.5979166667 Thank you for your question.  I am very sorry about your fall and hope that you are making progress in your recovery.  You described the circumstances of your fall after getting out of the shower and your injuries.  You stated that you are wondering if you have a case.  In NC, someone has a legal claim for compensation for their injuries if the injuries were caused by the negligence of another person or entity.  In NC, a person cannot recover compensation for their injuries if they contributed to those injuries by their own negligence.  So the two questions to be answered in determining whether you have a case are whether the facility where this occurred was negligent in some way in causing your fall and whether you were negligent in any way in relation to the fall.  Negligence generally is defined as unreasonable behavior and as to the providing of professional services at a care facility, there are standards of practice for how certain things should be handled.  Also, property owners, such as your care facility, are responsible for keeping their facilities in a safe condition and are required to warn people of unforeseen dangers in the property.  I cannot advise you with the limited information of an email exchange as to whether you have a case.  But I hope this information about our law helps you to think about whether you might have a case.  You can consult with an attorney about the situation.  You or your family also can speak with someone who operates the facility where this occurred about the incident.  The office within a company that addresses such matters is sometimes referred to as a risk management office or quality assurance office.  They can receive the facts of your case and conduct an investigation, which may involve an incident report being prepared.  This may help to have the situation addressed both with regard to whether you have a potential legal claim and also can put the company on notice of a safety problem they need to address with regard to their patients.  You and your family can decide whether you feel comfortable doing that without the assistance of an attorney or whether you want to consult an attorney first to learn more about your rights.  There are attorneys and law firms in NC that evaluate whether people have a potential case related to injuries in a nursing or care facility.  They can discuss this with you further.  Good luck to you in your recovery and in your consideration of a potential legal matter.44129.7104166667 Thanks so much for this information and your time44131.5541666667 You are welcome.  Good luck to you in your recovery and in considering your legal rights.  I do want to clarify one thing in the information.  If you contact the risk management or quality assurance office for the facility where this occurred, any investigation they undertake is for their purposes, which means they cannot advise you whether you have a claim.  But reporting it to them can help them be aware of what happened and puts them on notice of a potential problem they may need to address with their facility and/or staff.  They can advise you as to their belief as to whether they were at fault but they do not represent your interests in doing that.  I want to clarify that as you consider your options, including whether to consult an attorney.  Again, good luck to you.44131.5826388889 I ordered some contact ### from my eye doctor about five months ago and today I have gotten a chance to get them and when I got home I noticed that they all were expired some expired on ### ###19, what can I do about this? 44112.9590277778 I would recommend you contact your Eye Doctor (first) and the contact lens company (second) about the situation and see if they can refund you what you paid or provide new contact ###.

The easiest way is to have your husband sign a power of attorney over to you. The standard to incapacity is quite low. This means that if he can state the date, day of the week, general other facts (ie who is the president); he could sign one of these giving you full authority once he becomes incapacitated.

This surgery was intended to perform a labral tear repair along with femoral and acetabular osteochondroplasty. The labrum was to be ### back in place as it had been torn and any bone spurs to be shaved down. The impression after this surgery was that the surgeon had performed what he stated he would and that the issues at hand we resolved. However after this most recent surgery the surgeon revealed  that the sutures were free floating in my hip and that the labrum was torn and that there were still bone spurs that could not have grown within ###. I do not have a record of a MRI from ### that states that there was a labral tear which would give the surgeon a reason to perform a surgery. The MRI I have is from ###, yet a surgery was performed in ###. I have made drastic life changes between school, work and my life quality due to these surgeries and the amount of time required to recover. The amount of pain Iâ€™ve endured has taken a huge toll on my quality of life and how I enjoy it. I used to play soccer and tennis and havenâ€™t been able to do either ever since. I also have had two surgeries addressing similar issues on the right hip from the same surgeon at ### University  that have continued to give me pain and have not been resolved with surgery. It is known that there is an operable issue in the right hip as well that may have been caused by the surgeon. At this time we are waiting for the left hip to heal properly before addressing the right hip ###.  My question is, how do I file malpractice at this time for at least the left hip as there are multiple issues that the previous surgeon did not fix though his intention for surgery was to resolve these issues. My other question is, would it be wise to file a claim now just for the left hip or wait until I have surgery on the right side as well to make a joint claim that involves both hips as I can only assume that there will also be issues with the right side as well.  44127.1243055556 You should contact a personal injury attorney as soon as possible.

The time they sent me home bleeding from my gallbladder, they had given me over twenty units of blood and thought it was going into a ### vac I had on my leg, yet the vac never filled. All of these issues along with a few more now cause me severe ptsd and I'm already physically ### by them but now they've stolen my mental health too. Doctors have called me to apologize numerous times, but I can't work, get ssi, and my father just died at same hospital due to covid and I wasn't even allowed to see him but once for a few minutes, a panic attack caused me to lose half of the last few minutes I've could have ever had. Are there statute of limitations when the medical error ends up affecting me worse in the long run then it had originally? Should I look for a lawyer outside of my county? Do you think with a strong enough case they would just choose a settlement? Thank you for taking your time to help me with these questions. I never could face dealing with all of this while trying to physically heal but I know that in order to mentally heal I'd like to know that lazy judgment is a faulty way to practice medicine and no one else should ever go through what I've gone through at that hospital. They even messed me up so many times that they kept calling a different hospital to take me, a choice I gladly agreed to and probably the only reason why I've only died twice outside of an operating room due to their errors and the bigger judgement error of passing me along instead of fixing their mistake first, not preforming the proper diagnostics to accurately address the problem instead of assuming I want pain medicine, which I always refuse and then deal with the pain just so they will take me seriously. They did not the last time and that's when I lost the toe...Thank you for your time, legal advice, and for caring enough to volunteer your time,Thomas. ###44130.1347222222 Thank you for your question.  I am very sorry for what you have been through and are going through.  You have described various aspects of health care about which you have concerns.  Through this program, I cannot identify for you whether you have a case.  But I can share with you some general aspects of law in NC regarding medical negligence claims.  You asked about statute of limitations deadlines.  Yes, there are important deadlines in NC law related to how long a person has to file a lawsuit relating to an injury they contend is caused by negligence.  You must consult directly with a lawyer to convey the particular facts and details in order for them to provide you with the precise deadline that applies to your claim.  So I would recommend you consult an attorney right away if you want to learn those deadlines with regard to the particular items of medical care about which you have concerns.  In order to prove a case of medical negligence, one must be able to prove that the health care you received did not meet applicable standards of practice or that duties a healthcare provider owed to you were breached in some way.  This is how negligence is proved in a medical case.  You must also be able to show that you suffered injury as a result of the negligence.  These two items of proof usually require opinions by expert witnesses in the medical field of the care at issue and the alleged injury.  An attorney can assist in obtaining the review of cases by an expert and there are filing requirements in NC law related to expert reviews before a medical malpractice case is filed.  If you want to consult directly with an attorney and are having difficulty finding one, you can contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association at ###.  You can have a limited ### $###.  There are other attorneys in the field of medical malpractice you may be able to find on your own as well.  Good luck to you.44132.7166666667 Thank you very much44142.5256944444 Good afternoon: The employer did not violate HIPPA protections.  It actually violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. Employers must have a certain number of employees to be covered. The ### requires that positive COVID tests remain confidential, and your name should not have been disclosed to any other employee.  You can bring ### claims to the EEEOC, and for ### County, your regional office is likely in ###.  https://www.eeoc.gov/field-office/###/locationSince you voluntarily disclosed the positive cases for your wife and mother to your employer, you sort of waived any right to privacy by retelling it.  Since your wife and mom are not employees, the employer does not really owe them a right to privacy if that makes sense.  As it relates to you though, you were entitled to the privacy, and it was not lawful for the company to tell your co-workers. Good luck. 44149.8034722222 I tested positive for COVID and my supervisor named me specifically as the positive tests to other co-workers instead of keeping it confidential.  I also informed the supervisor and two owners that my wife and mother were positive as well, and asked for it to remain private, but found out from a co-worker today that she was told by the supervisor that it was a mild case got my family and I.  What are my options?44130.7652777778 I have a ###, both about land inherited. One part concerns Medicaid the other area is estate/inheritance.  I have been living out of my former business for the last few years, because there was a problem with the water on my home land. My father's land was divided into pieces between all sons back in the ###. I am the only one remaining. I was living on a piece which was my last living brother's until my nephews sold it. My oldest daughter tried to help buy it so I wouldn't be displaced, but we couldn't. I am retired and on a fixed income. That same daughter has paid my taxes for me, so I wouldn't lose everything. ### I had a heart attack and open heart ###. I need medicaid to help with my medical expense, but do not qualify due to the land asset. The land is going to my daughter anyway and the only reason I still have it is because she paid the taxes. I was told if she was a joint owner then I could possibly qualify for the medical help from Medicaid. I need to know if that is actually true and a legal fact.The second problem I have a question about is that when I was made to move onto my personal land back a few years ago, the last remaining piece to my family's property I was told there would be no road rights after me. My nephews told me if I sell the land while I'm living or leave the land to my daughters no one will have any road rights to the road I built ###. I also need to know if that is true. Please advise me on these two questions so I know what to do or what I can do. Thank you.44144.6854166667 Regarding your Medicaid question, Medicaid has a look-back" period that ranges from ### ###.  You can transfer the land into joint names but your daughter would have to pay you for one-half of the value of the property.  After you have spent down that amount of money for medical expenses then Medicaid would probably qualify you for benefits (I don't know for sure because there are a lot more questions I would have to ask you - so this is based solely on the information you just provided.)  If this is the only land that you own Medicaid would probably still qualify you for benefits.  If you end up with inpatient expenses for a facility then when you die the property would need to be sold to pay Medicaid back for the benefits you received.  Regarding your right of access to the property I'm afraid I would have to see all of the recorded instruments in your chain of title in order to answer that question.  If the recorded documents do not adequately speak to this issue there are several type of court actions for easements that are possibly available to you.I hope this information helps."44144.8159722222 I had a hernia repaired two months ago. I have had complications since. On Thursday, ###rd. I found myself in extreme pain on my way to work. I called the hospital that I had my surgery done at.

I demanded that they take the IV out of my arm so I could leave. They forced me to wait in extreme pain for a length of time before taking it out.I was able to gather my things and leave. EMS had given me morphine on the ambulance. I was not able to drive. Even if I was my car was miles away. Due to the actions of the staff i became stranded in extreme pain.

Also, Iâ€™m a smoker & have had ### â€˜surpriseâ€™ charges alleging that I was given medical advice on quitting smoking. First time ( a yr ago)- I was asked about it, went along, even though I had no intention in quitting- (covid and the stress!)â€¨ ###, I was charged an extra $###. The following appointment I was prepared to stop the conversation if it was brought up. It wasnâ€™t. Smoking, not smoking, none of that came up in the previous appointment.

I contested the surprise ### when I was on the phone, making this upcoming appointment. After speaking to the office manager, the receptionist told me that she â€˜was not in the roomâ€™ and basically that I was not to be believed. I have an appointment this Friday and planning to record all of my interactions- using the NC ### consent. Iâ€™m worried that if I am recording and the nurse practitioner asks why- that if I bring up the situation, that just by mentioning it, even if Iâ€™m referring to past appointments, that they will charge me for it.  Should I speak to the office manager when I arrive- to ask how to avoid being charged for this issue (and record it as well)?How should I go about recording my interactions at my next appointment? Is there anything specific I should say to make my intent clear when I start the recording? What can I do to make sure this does not happen again? This may be paranoid, but Iâ€™m worried that if I give them the recording- if they try to charge me again- the office will say that I tampered with it. Help.

I've been to physical therapy also have documentation from back specialist and my primary care doctor stating that my breast are causing my pain.. I had a referral to a plastic surgery but was denied bye medicaid for approval. Im currently waiting on a appeal. I have no lawyer i cant get through to legal aid. Line always busy... Medicaid said they ### giving breast reductions do to back and neck pain 2010...Not sure if ill have a cast at my appeal. Though i have strong evidence44184.2847222222 Ms. Brown, I am so sorry that you are having back and neck issues.  I know that they can impact every part of your life and truly am sorry that you are going through both the pain and the difficulty in getting the care that you need due to Medicaid's prior approval process.  Unfortunately, while Medicaid is required to pay for 'medically necessary' treatment by law, Clinical Coverage Policies have been adopted to help determine and define what is considered 'medically necessary' in different circumstances.  These Clinical Coverage Policies are helpful to have some additional understanding as to what is covered, but can make things very difficult when they do not authorize the care that you may need.  In your case the Clinical Coverage Policy that applies to Breast Surgeries, 1A-12, does not cover bilateral breast reduction (of both breasts) due to pain regardless of the documentation that you may have.  Specifically, it only covers breast reductions of a unilateral (one) breast in certain circumstances as noted in Section 3.2.1.d or bilaterally when part of a ### surgery associated with a lumpectomy or ### due to cancer under 3.2.1.e. The actual policy can be found at https://files.nc.gov/ncdma/documents/files/1A-12_0.pdf  and the sections I've referenced are on page 7. What this means is that Medicaid will not cover - or pay - for the surgery.  Given the policy does not allow for the coverage in any other circumstances, the appeal is not likely to be favorable.  You can still continue working with your doctor to discuss with the Hospital whether it may be willing to provide the surgery for you without payment from Medicaid due to your circumstances.44200.9319444444 Hello. My ###, but we were notified at the beginning of this year that she would be losing it due to her age; however, they have been continuing coverage month to month bc of Covid. As a precaution, I also added her to my BCBS Healthcare Marketplace policy. I didnt realize I was responsible for notifying Medicaid that she had a secondary insurance. Medicaid has now discovered this and denied payment for some recent ###. And I was told BCBS wont pay bc I didnt get prior approval. These ### cost around $32,### ###. I am afraid of the possibility of being accused of Medicaid fraud and wanted to get advice before contacting either insurance company. Thanks so much!44186.6770833333 I recommend you contact BCBS and explain the situation and see if they will make an exception.  Medicaid should pay whatever BCBS does not pay.  Just be very up front with both BCBS and Medicaid and see if you can get it worked out with BCBS as primary payer and Medicaid as secondary.  You did not intend to make this mistake and you won't be accused of Medicaid fraud - it was an honest mistake.  If you cannot get either BCBS or Medicaid to pay for the recent ###, then the medical provider will not be happy but they will be out of luck.  You are not personally responsible for paying the ### unless you signed some document stating that you would be personally responsible.  Your daughter is personally responsible but she probably does not have any money and the provider knows that - so they will probably not go after your daughter for the cost of the ###.If it does not work out as it should, you may need to hire an attorney to help you or a company which is experienced in medical insurance denials - there are companies who help people appeal denials of coverage for private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid.44186.6861111111 Medical Claims Rx in Chapel Hill handles insurance claims appeals.

There is no legal distinction between a person and his/her business when the business is an unincorporated sole ### or general (or limited) partnership, so yes, your business is in its entirety an asset to the extent that your receipts exceed your expenses.

I am not sure about SSI since I do not regularly handle legal matters with that kind of implication, but as for Medicaid, your ownership of a business interest can be counted as an asset for Medicaid penalties or the five-year lookback period.  To what extent Medicaid would reach depends on how your business is structured, and whether there is a clear distinction between company assets and personal assets.This is just one of several reasons why you would want to collaborate in greater detail with an estate planning lawyer who is also well versed in Medicaid asset protection planning.  While there is overlap between the two areas, not all estate planning lawyers are necessarily ### in Medicaid asset planning, which is a nuanced subset of its own.Best wishes.44225.0284722222 So are you saying that it is different for ssi than it is for medicaid, because ssi didn't count my business assets like bank accounts for the business as assets for many years. I think it may have been under the PESS (Property Essential for Self Support) aspect of it. It did not count when I was on ssi when i had one. Is medicaid not under the same rules as PESS or is a brokerage considered different than a bank account for sole proprietorships? Does Medicaid have a PESS program too. or is that only ssi?44222.0923611111 Can I take legal action against a dentist office that tried to remove teeth that they were not equipped to remove?I had a consult to get my wisdom teeth removed and my dentist did an exam and scheduled an appointment.

Lawyers are typically hesitant to ### light a potential medical malpractice claim, because confirming the existence of a valuable claim requires such an intensive analysis of not only a timeline similar to the one you prepared, but also testimonial facts from the patient, and the patient's medical records.  It is almost impossible to receive a yes" or "no" as to a medical malpractice case on a website like this one since this is designed for questions more basic than the very worthwhile one you are asking.  I agree that you need to act with reasonable diligence given the three-year statute of limitations (accruing from the date of injury) and that a timeline/summary view of events leading up to the injury is highly desirable to a medical malpractice lawyer at the vetting stage.I am not sure how long you have been waiting for the lawyer you consulted with to get back with you but generally you can count on waiting for ###-###.  If you need to find other lawyers in North Carolina to consult with for second or third opinions feel free to visit ### and use the "Find a Lawyer" feature and search by town or city under the "Medical Malpractice" category.  You can also contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association at the link below:https://www.ncbar.org/members/resources/lawyer-referral-service/I hope that the lawyer you spoke with earlier will get back with you soon as well.

I hope you are doing well. It is normal for physicians to refer things like this to their insurance company. If you are interested in seeking relief from the insurance company, you will want to provide the information requested to the insurance company. It is possible for you to do this on your own, but you may want to consider hiring an attorney who specializes in medical malpractice. It would be helpful to know more about your communication so far with the physician. It's unlikely that a physician would issue an apologize (even if an issue was considered minor), as that could be used as evidence of wrongdoing on their part. Please let me know if I can help further. Thanks, ###44298.6513888889 Hi, ###, I just tried to give you a call from ###-###. Give me a call back when you can. Thanks, ### 44302.8291666667 Hi, ###, It was nice speaking with you today. I hope that our discussions were helpful. As a recap so that I can refresh my memory later if needed: we talked about the theory of liability and ideas for restructuring for clarity we discussed the legal theory behind medical malpractice we discussed the types of medical documentation that could be submitted we discussed the possibility of meeting with another physician to get a quote we discussed the possibility of meeting with medical malpractice attorneys to see if someone would take your case on a contingency basis. If you decide to move forward without an attorney, I am happy to look over your theory of liability again and help you decide on an amount of damages to demand. Good luck! Thanks, ### 44305.7444444444 Hi, ###, Yes, your theory of liability is, in a nutshell, what you think that the doctor did improperly and why. You will want to explain what the doctor did wrong, and why it was wrong. It may be helpful to provide examples (via internet research etc) of the procedure done properly and what that would look like. Often, medical bills will be involved because people have to visit other doctors to have problems corrected. In this case, you will not have any.For damages, you have to explain to them in what way you have been harmed by what occurred. Try to be as detailed as you can and explain how this has affected you from when it originally happened up until this day. Be specific. This is often very hard to prove. You should be prepared for them to push back" against your claims and the process could take awhile. Medical malpractice is a very complicated area of the law. If you feel that you have substantial damages on the line I would encourage you to consult with an attorney. Thanks ###"44298.7854166667 Hi, By when would you like to return this to them?

We can try to talk this afternoon if that works for you. 44302.5381944444 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  This sounds like an interesting business enterprise.  While you will eventually need to hire both a local business lawyer and CPA, I can offer a few suggestions for you to consider in your planning process.  Please see the following below:First, you likely would want to organize an LLC in North Carolina, and hire a local lawyer to draft an operating agreement to ### your personal liability protection, and to identify the capital and governance structure of your company.  The operating agreement, unlike the Articles of Organization, is a private document and is not filed with the Secretary of State.Second, as you mentioned, you should indeed have some form of business insurance.  What package you purchase is largely up to you.  General business liability insurance is a good option, provided that you carefully review the terms of your policy in order to know what liabilities are, and are not, covered.  You can also contact the Wake County Health Department and the NC Department of Health and Human Services to see if they offer any guidance to the public about liability insurance policies for the kind of work you plan to perform in your new business (not sure, but if so, these are the two authorities where I would make initial inquiries). Third, at least consult with a local CPA who advises small businesses, in order to get the best advice on tax consequences of your new business.  My educated guess is that the default pass-through (i.e., disregarded") status will be more than sufficient for you if this is going to be a single-member LLC but a CPA can confirm this for you once s/he knows the details about your business.  It would be a good idea to have your lawyer cross reference your ### advice while the former is drafting your operating agreement.This is a good start on how to properly set up and govern your new business while protecting yourself from personal liability exposure as much as the law permits.###."44298.9416666667 I would like to start my own wellness check service for seniors citizens in my area. I would like to know which insurance(s) I need to have to cover my business. I will not be ### any medicine. I will not be physically touching the residents i.e. ###, providing shots, feeding. The sole purpose is to do a safety visit by knocking on the door and waiting for the resident to respond. I would like to have a spare key for the resident's home. The spare key will be used only for the purpose if there's no response to the knock at the door or the phone call. The goal is to make sure no one has fallen and/or badly hurt. Sometimes living by yourself while being a senior can make you vulnerable. Therefore I can access their home and call 911. I do plan on being CPR certified as well.Again the business structure is just doing a wellness check. Not there to do any household work. Or providing health care assistance. I would like to know if there's any specific insurances Wake County, North Carolina would require. Thank you for your time any assistance is greatly appreciated!44298.4875 Hi Ms. Day,Although your doctorâ€™s office is required to produce your medical records to you, it is not required to do so on the same day that you request the records.  The physician is only required to provide the records in a â€œtimely manner,â€ which the Board of Registration in Medicine typically interprets as being two to three weeks (###4-###).  Federal law allows up to ###.  I have attached a medical records brochure issued by the Board of Registration in medicine, which says that the Board defines a request for medical records to be satisfied in a â€œtimely mannerâ€ when the request is satisfied within two to three weeks.  Thus, if you requested your records yesterday and your doctor is out for a few days, he will still be within the law if he releases your records to you when he comes back to the office as long as you get your records within ###-###. Below, are the state laws and re###tions that are relevant to your question:### Ch. ######### Â§ 70E(g): â€œEvery patient . . . shall have the right: upon request, to inspect his medical records and to receive a copy thereof in accordance with section 70 . . .â€;### Ch. ######CC: â€œA health care provider who maintains records for a patient treated or examined by such provider shall permit inspection of such records by such patient or an authorized representative of the patient, and upon request, a copy of such patientâ€™s records shall be furnished upon payment of a reasonable fee.â€###.### ###.07(###3)(b): â€œUpon a patientâ€™s request, a licensee shall provide the following in a timely manner, to a patient . . . ###. The opportunity to inspect a patientâ€™s medical record.â€Also, I noticed that your specific question was about urine results, so I wanted to hi###ght another law for you that may be helpful.  If the urine test is for employment purposes, you may be able to get your urine test results (and any other physical examination results) from your employer under M.### Ch. ###49 Â§ ###9A, which requires that: â€œAny employer requiring a physical examination of an employee shall, upon request, cause said person to be furnished with a copy of the medical report following the said examination.â€Please let me know if you have any questions.Best,### Das, Esq. 43228.8479166667 I requested a copy of my urine results from my doctor's office the office told me my doctor must sign off before they can release the results to me is this legal practice my doctor is out of the office for a few days and I requested my results now I thought as long as I sign a medical release I could get my results right then and there43228.8472222222 ###:The Patient advocate program should also be able to connect you with other resources in the community which should include help with your insurance.

Before dual-eligibility I had been on ### since ###10. During this time Iâ€™ve become progressively more disabled from a combination of autoimmune, endocrine, nervous, skeletal and hematologic disorders with no treatment until finally limited symptomatic treatment this past year without any investigation into underlying causes. These include anemia, ###, secondary adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadism, osteoporosis, ### ###, femur and tibia fracture from a low impact fall, spinal stenosis, blue extremities without exertion, and â€œlosses of time.â€ These began progressing much faster in the past year and a half and after trying to find better care coordination myself through new PCPs I began asking ### for help beginning ###16. Numerous requests received no response. Once on Medicare in ### ### (the fastest I could get an appointment each time.) I kept explaining how I could barely get out of bed and showering was so exhausting and made my feet turn blue that I would then have to rest before even getting dressed. I did not even receive a CBC until my last visit in October which was highly abnormal but he still wouldn't address it until my next appointment a month later. I also requested a referral to a Neurologist because of numbness, weakness, and pain from spinal stenosis which he said he would not do until I gave him my psychiatric records. After several emails/calls he did issue a referral but I showed up to the appointment to find out it was a neuropsychiatrist--nothing to do with spinal stenosis, numbness or weakness. Meanwhile I had requested a Fair Hearing from ### due to their lack of response to my requests for help with care coordination. After ### ###, I received a call from an unidentified member of the board of hearings who said I never received a response because there was nothing they could do about it. He said my only option was OneCare which finally after the last appointment with the MGH PCP I joined. Now after ###, numerous calls regarding the urgency of my situation and a 4-day hospital admission, I'm set to re-enroll in original Medicare since OneCare did not help at all and I couldn't even see the doctors the hospital wanted me to follow up with. I don't know what to do since I can barely shower and eat granola bars in bed since I can't stand long enough to cook most days. I'm wondering what my options are and if ### has any legal obligation to make sure I have access to care and if my rights were violated by the MGH PCP who wouldnâ€™t order any tests or refer me to a specialist without psychiatric records. I'm quickly becoming too sick to manage this on my own.43228.8479166667 Mr ###:MGH can and may have assigned a social worker to work with you on your medical care.  These types of issues can be overwhelming and usually there is a social worker at the hospital to help you navigate the system.  That is where I would start. I will try and find more information about this and get back to you.###43228.8486111111 You are great.  I really appreciate your help with this and the other question I posted.  I looked online and saw a Patient Advocate program but it's meant to help you work things out with your existing doctor and I can't trust him.  The social services says you need to be referred by your doctor but they are both worth trying to explain my situation in case they may still help.  I will try contacting them. Thanks again.###43228.8486111111 Appologies. Neighborhood Health is subject to the same issue. I would reach out again and specify that you need more than just a neurosurgeon, one who can specifically handle the issue. If you have a letter from the physician, i would attach it. I would re-enforce that you will notify the state because the network is inadequate. That should hopefully get their attention. If not, then i would call the Medicaid office and file a complaint. The buzz word is network adequacy. They will get in trouble for an insufficient network.

They think a neurosurgen is just a neurosurgeon but not all of them can treat my specific issue.43228.8479166667 Ms. ###-If you are receiving your ### benfits through Network Health, Network Health is required to have a policy in place to arrange for care by a qualified provider if the care is not available from an in-network provider. You need to notify the insurer and request that they direct you to an out-of network provider who can provide the service because there are no qualified providers in the network who can provide the service. You should note that their network is not adequate and that you will be notifying the state if necessary.  The plan should direct you to an approriate physician, though it may not be the physician of your choosing.43228.8479166667 So crazy!  Just after replying to you I got word that I was approved.

I really do need to move but I'm not ready to sell. Please advice - Thank you43228.8513888889 The program your husband is applying for has both an income and an asset test.  Your husband's separate countable income must be under $### (2017). Rental income will be counted but only after certain business expenses are deducted from the gross rent collected. Also if both you and your husband are entitled to the rental income, only his share of the income will count against the $###. The ### rules are at ### 520.010 (c) (rental income).There is also an asset test. A house that he occupies as a principal residence will not be counted as an asset, but if the house is rented out and neither of you live in the house, this exclusion will not apply.

Because of these, I was wondering if the law accomodates any hardships from taking employer insurance, and what defines those hardships.  Here is an incomplete list of my family's hardships:We see mental health providers that do not accept ### directly, nor accept billing ### through a fee-per basis.  This means that, as our health insurance choice charges a deductible, we must pay all deductibles out-of-pocket without financial assistance from ###.

How soon is it? Does it cover the entire amount? Does it cover up-to a certain insurance?   Are there circumstances upon which we don't qualify? To get an insurance on-par with ###, we would need to pay twice the montly premium--would ### cover that?The amount that her health insurance premiums cost are pushing my spouse to get a second job, as our budget can't already handle our food budget problems.

Again I suggest you and your brother consult an attorney to enable you both to understand what kind of distributions he an make under the trust, how it might affect your benefits, and also any tax or other consequences. If you don't want to go to the lawyer who ### up the trust, you can certainly go to someone else, but will need to bring a copy of the trust document. Before selecting a lawyer, you can ask about the fee to make sure it is something affordable given the size of the trust. If you want to consult an attorney with experience in special needs trusts, you may want to look for an attorney who is a member of the Mass. Chapter of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys. It's website is here: ###/  I'm sorry but don't think I can be of any further help.###43228.8520833333 Hi, I am on SSDI, in public housing, and receive ###.There is a irevokable disability trust in my name aft my dad died, but my brother always says i can't get any money from it, because it will affect my ### or housing.

If you don't think that's a good option, do you have a copy of the trust document?###43228.8520833333 No, i don't have a copy of the trust document, but my brother would.

If your SSDI & other countable income exceeds $###, you will go over the income guidelines for ### for that month. ### is based on current monthly income. If you are ###, the income limit is lower and there is an asset test. Some distributions from a trust --like cash paid to you--are countable income, but some kinds of distributions may not be countable. One thing you can do is meet with the lawyer who set up the trust to find out more about what kind of distributions will not result in countable income for ### purposes. For example, your brother could make you a small cash allowance that would not put your income over the $### in-kind" payments that benefit you but will not count as income. Depending on your relationship with your brother you and he may want to meet with the trust lawyer together to learn about the options and come up with a plan or you may want to meet with the trust lawyer on your own. If you don't know who the trust lawyer is you can also meet with another private attorney.  You can try legal services but may need to find a private lawyer who charge for their services. I can give you the names of some private lawyers who handle "special needs trusts" if that is what you want to do.There are also some ### programs with higher income guidelines than $###. If you qualify for ### home and community based services or PACE the current upper income limit is $###. These programs have age and clinical eligiblity rules and an asset test and are primarily for people who need long ### supports to live in the community. You can get more information about these programs from a local organization in your community. ###/If you are working at least ###-time deductible there is also a ### program for people with disabilities  called  CommonHealth in which ### charges a monthly premium based on income rather than applying an upper income limit. Assuming you also have Medicare a SHINE counselor may also be able to tell you more about CommonHealth &  other pathways to ### with higher income limits .###I don't have information on the subsidized housing implications but you can check with the housing office of your project or the housing authority about the upper income guidelines to remain eligible what rules they may have for counting a trust distribution (often if matters whether it is cash or "in-kind") and how an increase in countable income would affect your rent.

Obviously, the judge agreed with this assessment.Do I have a legal case here? And if so, with whom should l be conferring? I was recently struck with an autoimmune disease which has made me severely impaired. It was cast in the request to the court as being alcohol related. Another inference based on no scientific findings. Also, the morning of my discharge and trip to court I was given outrageous amounts of IV sedatives by a male nurse who also told another girl on the unit that a girl on the unit was being sectioned. I was the only other girl on the unit". She is willing to attest to this. What section of the HIPPA code would this violate?

I need help and protection.44117.7652777778 Good afternoon:  You may have a case, but I can't tell whether you do or not.  Regardless, I suggest you contact an attorney in your area that has an expertise in medical malpractice.  There are a lot of reasons why you may not have a case but the small amount of information you have provided does not allow me to make any reliable judgment.  However, if the cancer was discovered within ###, there is a likelihood that the delay has not resulted in any damage to you.  Expert medical testimony will be required to establish that damage was done - that is, the delay caused your cancer to worsen or reach a point that treatments available at the time of the first scan are no longer available because of the delay.  The second hurdle is whether the scan was faulty at all.  It may have been the interpretation of the scan or the nature of the scan that was ordered.  If so, it may be the doctor who is at fault, not the ### office.  Regardless of who may be at fault, if anyone, the burden on a plaintiff is to prove that to reasonable degree of medical certainty that the doctor or other healthcare provider failed to meet the standard of care - considering all factors.  Here's the statute that governs medical malpractice standard of care:  http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0###/0766/Sections/0766.102.htmlAgain, I can't determine whether you have  case that may be successful.  Therefore, I urge you to contact a local attorney who should consult with you without initial charge.  If he/she believes you have a good case, most personal injury, including medical malpractice, attorneys, will handle the case on a contingency fee basis.Good luck.44127.7111111111 Had 1st CT scan done in ### in the Villages".

He does not have a current legal case open toward this issue. My father became addicted to prescription opioids many years ago and, when threatened with a termination from his job, sought medical attention to become clean. The doctor he went to prescribed him Suboxone. Suboxone is a drug commonly used to help opioid addicts lessen their cravings and work toward becoming clean. In most cases, Suboxone is used under medical supervision to wean a person off the opioids within a year, sometimes a little over a year. In my father's case, his doctor did not try to lessen the doses when progress in his (my father's) performance was made. My father showed signs of improvement in every day life, such as improving his work performance and saving money. His doctor continued to prescribe my father the same dose of Suboxone and he has done so for over ###. My father's job is now at stake again as the Suboxone has cut into his life the same way the opioids did. The doctor continues to prescribe them, despite my father ###. My father is currently seeking more intense medical treatment by entering a rehab center for addicts to get off Suboxone. My father has spent over ###.

However, you should contact local attorneys who have particular expertise in medical malpractice to determine whether the statute of limitations might have begun to run later than age ###, such as product liability for the drug.

Instead if they have failed to fulfill the obligations under the policy you can sue them for your damages.  That doesn't help you get your dental issues addressed.

B premium, and I highly recommend that your check with her ### plan to understand why her out of pocket costs for the cataract surgery were so high before she pays this ###. On the ### front, itâ€™s more complicated. Even if she spends down her assets, her income will be too high to qualify for ### Standard for community residents. There is an income spenddown program but it is not a workable solution for most people. There are a couple of specialized ### programs with higher income limits, but only if she is either very disabled or, on the other hand, can work at least part-time. For her dental care, some options are the nearest community health center with a dental clinic or one of the dental schools which offer reduced price services. More information on all this is set out below. If her income is $### $6000, she is currently eligible for a program administered by ### called the Buy-In that will pay her Pt. B Medicare premium which is usually $###. It will also make her automatically eligible for â€œextra helpâ€ with the premium cost of her Medicare drug plan. The Buy-In application form is posted on the ### website here: ###Unlike the full ### application, it is a much shorter and simpler form. If she qualifies, ask check with ### that it will also cover her past ###. ### will pay her premium to Social Security and Social Security will stop deducting the premium from her checks and reimburse her for any past premiums ### pays.   She can also apply for the buy-in program by using the standard ### application for seniors. This has the advantage of also being an application for Health Safety Net coverage which can help with hospital out of pocket costs and costs at a Community Health Center dental clinic that Medicare does not cover, but it is a more complicated application and will require verification of her assets. Medicare covers cataract surgery and while she will have out of pocket costs, $###. It sounds like she is in a Medicare Advantage plan through ###. Take a look at her ### card and any Explanation of Benefit form she has related to her eye surgery. When you are with her, call ### to ask them to explain her out of pocket costs. If you think there is a problem with her Medicare coverage, there is help. There is a program called SHINE that can provide Medicare counselling (This is a website where you can find a SHINE counselor near her. ### ), and if her Medicare charges appear questionable the Medicare Advocacy Project at GBLS should be of help, call 800-###. The ### financial standards for people age ### 100% of the poverty level or $### 2018, in addition to the countable resource standard of only $2000. Even if she spent down her assets to $2000, her income would be too high for ###. After applying a $###, her income of $### $###. She can qualify for ### through an income spend-down program, but it compares her income to a standard of $### 100% of poverty. She would have to incur medical and related expenses of $### ### (($1210-522)*6) before ### kicked in and even then it would only be for the balance of the six months, and then it starts all over with another deductible/spenddown amount for the next ###. In terms of her assets of $6,000, she can spend-down for any purpose, so long as she does not give the assets away, but should be sure to keep her receipts to show where the assets went. Paying her ### to the doctor (after confirming that Medicare has paid its share of the cost) and setting up a burial account would be one way to do it. For ### purposes, she can set up a separately ### account at her bank for funeral expenses up to $###. The separate account will not be counted against the $###, but unlike an irrevocable burial trust set up through a funeral home, the money remains available to her if she needs it for another pressing need later. You said that she was disabled. If she is very disabled, she might qualify for the ### Frail Elder Waiver which uses a higher income standard that she can meet, but has the same $###. If this is a possibility, you can call one of the agencies on this website for more information and an evaluation if this looks like an option. ###/ On the other hand, if she cannot work full time but could work at least ### â€“even if it is non-competitive employment--she might qualify for the ### CommonHealth program for the working disabled which has no asset test. The agencies at the website above can supply more information about that program too if it is a possibility she wants to explore. For her dental work, she might want to contact one of the dental schools or a community health center near her that operates a dental clinic or look into the costs of purchasing dental insurance through the Health Connector. ### ###, Health Law AttorneyMassachusetts Law Reform Institute43318.5784722222 I am a social worker working with a ###, unmarried,  disabled woman.

You don't mention a spouse, so I am assuming you are a household of one. Household size affects the upper income limits for ###. For a single adult under age ###, your current monthly income must be under ###33% of the poverty level to qualify for ###, and there is a standard deduction from your income. The dollar amounts are adjusted each March, but in 20###8, ###33% of the poverty level for a single person is $### $5###. If your yearly income is $###5,996, I assume your current monthly income is ###/### $###333. This means right now ### is comparing your current income of $###282 ($###333-5###) to the upper income limit of $###346. If your income were $###, you current monthly income would be $### $###. If you took a one-time lump sum award of $###5,000, the first question is whether it would be considered taxable income.  I don't know the anser to that. You will have to find out from your pension plan, accountant, or tax advisor. ### generally follows the tax rules. If it's the kind of income that is included in adjusted gross income" (line ### ###040) it will be counted by ###. However even if it is taxable ### only counts a lump sum as income  in the month of receipt. This means at worst a lump sum may disqualify you for a single month.  As a practical matter because it can take more than a month for ### to process a reported change in income it may not disqualify you at all. There is no asset test for people under age ### $###5### but any interest or dividend income will be counted toward your monthly income.However the rules change when you turn 65 (and presumably qualify for Medicare). At 65 the ### upper income limit is ###00% of the poverty level. In ### $### and there is a standard deduction of $20. There is also an asset test of $### (but some assets like your house and car do not count). Therefore once you turn 65 you will make too much for ### just based on your Social Security income. (Different rules apply if you need nursing home care). I hope you find this information helpful. Let me know if it is not clear.### ###MLRI Health Law Attorney"43419.8222222222 I have been given the option from my pension plan I had with ### Labs ( I worked there for ### ) to take a lump sum of ###.How will the lump sum effect my ### (Medicaid ) benefits ?I have to decide whether to take the lump sum or take ###I am ### ###.I have to make a decision by ### or I wait  until I am ###.I am currently ### 15,###which I began when became ###. 43413.8590277778 Thank You for your help it cleared up the issue.I sent in my form  for the lump sum distribution Friday the 23, 2018.

Legal Answers On-Line (MLAO").  I will try to respond helpfully to your question.I doubt that your girlfriend is able to "take you off child support if there is a court order relating to the child support.  In general, child support usually is court ordered; and only a judge can order that no child support has to be paid, and it would be a rare case for that to happen.  In Massachusetts, the law generally requires that both parents provide support for their dependent children; and Massachusetts courts usually will not allow one parent to take off" the other parent's child support obligations [three possible exceptions are noted below].  Moreover the Massachusetts Department of Revenue Child Support Enforcement Division ("DOR/CSE") most likely would require that the non-custodial parent pay the amount of child support ordered by the court and calculated based on the formulas in the current Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines if the custodial parent gets Mass Health for their child.  So even if your girlfriend wants to stop your child support obligations she probably would not be able to persuade a judge or the DOR/CSE to terminate your current child support obligations especially if she is receiving public assistance (such as Mass Health or AFDC) for your child.  (They also would not allow her to have no health insurance for your child when it is reasonably available if these issues were in court.)If no child support has ever been ordered by a court and if your support payments have been made voluntarily without any court order then you and the mother may agree to whatever amount or type of support that you both agree is fair and reasonable.  However if there is a court order for you to pay child support then the court is not likely to allow you out of child support except possibly in a few unusual types of cases:  {###} the mother marries another man who then adopts the child as his own (at the same time relieving the biological father of the court order for his child support); or {###} the non-custodial parent has no income and no ability to be employed (for example a complete disability) and he successfully pursues a Complaint for Modification in the Probate and Family Court to reduce or to suspend his child support obligation; or {###} the parents start to live together with their child with both parents contributing to a joint family household and they successfully petition the court to modify an earlier child support order.If you know of another way that applies to your situation which might allow your girlfriend [the child's mother I presume] to "take you off child support then you may send me that information [i.e., how that could ever be done] through MLAO within ten days; and I would try to respond to that.  43656.7201388889 I just wanted to know if my son loses his mass health if she takes me off child support 43630.0756944444 My prior PCP & Insurance (### Health Together with CHA) in the proper management of my diabetes care finally arranged for me to have a manual pump (### device) and ### Sensor ### for blood sugar monitoring.

Legal Answers On-line (MLAO").  I see that no one else has responded to your marriage questions and that you have some deadline in two days; and so I decided to respond as best I can even though I have had no client and no experience with a similar dilemma or similar questions and I cannot give you any definitive answers.I am assuming that you already have decided to remain legally single (with no legal marriage); and I will not comment about that subject or your reasoning.  I have no information that ### would object to your cohabitation or reconsider your eligibility based on your cohabitation.  (Do they require participants to report household members who contribute to the participants' support?  I do not know.)  Your questions I believe center around still having a religious ceremony with family and friends.  Is it "legal"?  Would the "officiant" require you to have a marriage license to perform the ceremony?  Could the "officiant" be a lay person? I cannot answer what a ### or other person might require of you (as their legal obligation to perform your ceremony).  I also do not know if a religious facility would allow a lay person to conduct a ### ceremony in its facility.  One idea is to ask them.  It might be easier than you anticipate.As I understand your goals (based on your statement to the MLAO) you want a religious ceremony with family and friends and religious ### to celebrate your new or increased commitment to each other.  In other circumstances this might be called a "civil union which however has no legal status in Massachusetts (nor elsewhere, as far as I know, except in states that have ### civil unions" for gay couples).  Since the financial implications of a legal marriage seem insurmountable to you a this time and since you want the happy ceremony to declare something to your friends and family you might just ask everyone else who is involved whether this plan is feasible and acceptable.  I see no legal impediment to your calling it a "civil union" [outside legal matrimony and without the legal rights and the legal obligations of a legal marriage].  I believe that most people could understand and have empathy for your dilemma and your goals.  Many seniors these days have similar financial issues when they come to consider formalizing their love relationships with new partners; and I believe that many decide against getting legally married although they intend the relationship to be ### loving and permanent.  [The following is not legal advice or commentary but it seems to me to be a natural follow-up consideration.]  Have you told your family and friends that you will not be legally married at this ceremony and do they accept it?   As a matter of courtesy I doubt that a surprise announcement at the ceremony would be welcomed.  Keeping it secret might be worse.  Going through with it if everyone will celebrate with you seems like a joyful idea!  Good luck."43736.7034722222 I am a ###. I am currently working part-time making about $15,###. I live with my partner and we would like to get married but are concerned about health care costs. Given the options provided by his job, if we get legally married we will need to pay about $25,###, deductibles and copays (we expect to hit the out of pocket maximum on any plan we choose). Our combined income is above the amount where I would still qualify for ### and just above the amount that would allow me to get subsidies on a connector plan. However, our income is still low enough that we would be paying ###/###. We know that we could just choose to not get legally married and stay single entities legally and are okay with that option. Our question is this: Before realizing the financial implications, we had already booked a wedding venue and are excited to have a religious Jewish ceremony and celebrate our relationship with family and friends. Is it okay to have this type of commitment ### wedding and just not go through the process to legally marry until the health insurance issues improve? We would of course continue to file our taxes separately, be single entities for all legal purposes, and not claim any of the financial benefits of marriage (taxes, hospital visitation, etc...). Does the state or federal government or ### care if we have a ceremony and a party but don't get a marriage certificate and marriage license and legally remain the same status we have now?This seems like something that people have done for a variety of reasons but we want to make sure that it is legal.We are also wondering if an officiant who performs the ceremony has any legal obligation to have a marriage license from the couple in order to perform a religious (Jewish) ceremony. The officiant could be either a layperson or a ### member (###) if that matters at all for this question. 43731.0916666667 Hi ###.  Thank you for your question.I don't think I understand.  Does your employer just need proof that you are married?  Or is your employer asking for more information about your divorce decree?If your employer just needs proof that you are married, you can get a marriage certificate from the county you got married in.  If you tell me where that was, I can send you an address and telephone number. If your employer is asking for more information about your divorce decree, what do you think your employer is asking for?  Maybe it would be enough to show your employer a copy of the divorce decree.  If you don't have a copy, you can get one from the court where you got divorced.  If you tell me where that was, I can send you an address and telephone number.  I hope this is helpful.

If the Health Connector does not agree that  you are due a refund, it's a different kind of problem. The Health Connector has an internal Ombudsman to help people who don't get anywhere with customer asssistance. If you haven't tried that office, it's worth a shot. This is a website explaining how to reach them. https://www.mahealthconnector.org/about/contact#contact-ombudsmanIf you've been there, done that, another avenue is to go to your state or federal ### constituent services offices who may be more successful getting the Health Connector's attention. You can locate your state legislators at this website. ###  You can find your federal legislators here https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/MAThere is also a legal process for addressing disputes with the Health Connector that can be used to appeal from the Connector's inaction in not refunding this money but it will take longer to go that route.Try the Ombudsman and/or elected officials & let me know if that gets you nowhere & you still need help.Good luck.### ###, Mass.

Martins"44384.66875 There are several questions and issues here.  First, a HIPAA violation arises when your personal medical information is released to a third party without your consent.  If new" providers' names appear in your patient portal you should inquire directly to the provider(s) and ask if they have access to your records and why.  Very often providers are listed in the patient portal because they were residents ### consultants or other folks who were involved in your care.  You may not recognize their names.As for information "###" from your portal records I can't give a definitive answer.  Patient ### are notorious for omissions of data.  When I review a potential claim I never trust portal information.  I ask the institution for a "full and unredacted" set of records.  That works for me as an attorney; I've found however that hospitals routinely ### information when patients request records.  I suspect you'll need to ask an attorney to get the ### for you.  They can also request an audit trail which identifies any changes made in the electronic medical record (this step usually requires filing a lawsuit and I'm not sure that you have a claim based on this limited information).Third a HIPAA violation--unless really egregious--is hard to prosecute.  It's a miserable process to fight expensive to pursue and it must be filed in federal court.All told I would suggest that you focus upon treatment of your Hep C not on the medical records.

Honestly, this post does not make a lot of sense.  I do not see any immediate evidence of a HIPAA violation, but if you believe your HIPAA privacy rights were violated, you can go online and file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for an investigation.As to retrieving lost communications, data entries, etc., you can go up higher the hospital administrative chain and see if someone in management can help you with this, or have a healthcare lawyer send the hospital a letter on your behalf, demanding certain information that you previously had access to, and which has been subsequently omitted.  If you decide to reach out to local lawyers, consider either healthcare lawyers in private practice, medical malpractice lawyers, or general practitioners.All the best to you this summer, and I hope that whatever health-related concerns you might have right now will be allayed with positive developments in the near future.  Blessings to you.44396.7465277778 You are very welcome, Ms. Martins.  Have a good summer, and be well.44397.7652777778 Do I have a claim regarding hernia mesh surgery.  There was a lawsuit regarding problems with the mesh used in these surgeries.  I had double hernia surgery where this mesh was placed in my body for this procedure.  This surgery was done on 4-15-2016.  Several months later, I had to have emergency surgery to remove the mesh.  Thank you for your help.44442.6263888889 Good morning, Mr. ###es:Thank you very much for posting on NC Free Legal Answers, and a happy fall to you, upcoming.  While we cannot say for sure on this website whether you have a valid lawsuit over the material used in the surgery (as this website is more for general legal questions than ### inquiries), I do believe that what you describe here is serious enough that it merits a closer look by either a products liability or medical malpractice lawyer, during an initial consultation on this matter.  Many though not all such lawyers offer initial consultations for free, so this is definitely something worth exploring.  I can recommend at least two lawyers in my network who can help you get started.  See if either of these might work for you:### ### https://pckb-law.com/attorney/###athan-p-###### ###https://www.farrin.com/attorney/###-###/A question like yours can be answered only when a lawyer and his/her staff have reviewed your pertinent medical records and facts you can provide about the treatment you received, then review the medical standards in place at the time you received the surgery.  Once this analysis is completed after a consultation with you, a lawyer can give you a realistic assessment of whether you have a case, and if so, what its possible monetary value would be.I hope this helps somewhat.  Blessings to you and yours this fall.44442.6409722222 Good afternoon, Ms. Allgood:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  Assuming that no serious bodily or psychological injury to you occurred as a result of the surgery, this would not be medical malpractice, but possibly duress and/or battery (in a civil sense), depending on the facts.  The only way to know for sure whether you have a viable lawsuit for anything against the head RN and/or the hospital where that person works is to consult in detail with a lawyer who handles personal injury, serious injury or medical malpractice cases (even though, again, this is not, strictly speaking, medical malpractice" if the issue is more about the coercion or intimidation rather than the actual treatment).  I would search online and see if you can find a few such lawyers who would offer you a ### initial consultation on this issue.Try searching on ### using the "Find a Lawyer" feature.  You can also contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association which tries to connect callers with North Carolina lawyers in various practice areas who charge only $### ###.

Good luck. 44463.7333333333 I visited FastMed twice in August to get a prescription for blood pressure medication and was treated by ### Routzahn, who prescribed 5mg of amlodipine since my blood pressure was averaging 140-150/110. After monitoring it for a month and seeing no change, I had a follow-up appointment on ###. A couple days previously I had a tooth issue and had to go to an emergency dental appointment, but because my blood pressure was then 170/130, and my dentist refused to do the tooth surgery because I was in stroke territory (this was likely because of the pain and lack of sleep that the tooth was causing). The dentist gave me the option of promising to go see my doctor the same day, or she would call an ambulance for me. I made the promise to see my doctor since their office was just around the corner, and went there immediately after leaving the dentist's office with a note from my dentist. I went to the receptionist's desk and asked to see ### Routzahn for just ###, but they told me they couldn't do that and I had to make an appointment for the following morning, so I did. When I came in for my appointment the next morning, my blood pressure was still at 170/130. Immediately upon walking in the room, ### started giving contradictory reasons for why she couldn't just increase my medication, but I responded with well something's got to give" because my blood pressure was dangerously high and my dentist won't fix my tooth problem because of it. She interrupted me to remind me that she was the doctor here and demanded respect (it was only later that I found out she is not in fact a doctor but an NP). At this point being upset and in pain I said "this is ### ridiculous I've been to your office four times paid over $###'re refusing to treat me". She responded by saying that she had been to school for too many years to be talked to this way. After which she told me I had to "fix my attitude" because she did not have to treat me and would not treat me until I apologized. Worried for my life I acquiesced she forced me to apologize several more times and made me promise several times that I would never complain to her again. She berated me further before finally sending in the prescription for ###. I was stripped of my dignity humiliated and forced to beg for my life. This woman should not be allowed to practice medicine."44456.6395833333 Had a hair transplant in ### with poor results, and I feel that I should get some if not all my money back. The doctor made some cuts and holes but I was blindfolded and know a technician was also making holes which I was told the doctor would solely do himself. I feel staff also wasnâ€™t medically trained or certified in assisting surgery, after taking to them during the procedure which also is apparent from the results. I was lied to I also paid by the ### and another doctor told me that I didnt receive the amount I paid for. Although thatâ€™s near impossible to prove. I also found out they used another clinics images on their website to make it seem like they have better results.

Thankyou 44459.6805555556 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  I am sorry to hear about such a painful experience.  This will be a tough battle to win, but if interested in pursuing this further, I would suggest consulting with a personal injury or medical malpractice lawyer (both of which types of lawyers often offer free consultations of ### ###, and sometimes more).  I suggest that you prepare a ###-###, and share with counsel any medical records about your treatment and the procedures done, and allow your lawyer to review all of these to better ascertain whether you have a claim that can stand up in court.  If so, your lawyer can send a demand letter on your behalf in order to initiate a private claim against the facility's liability insurance, or follow up with a lawsuit to the extent needed.  Search on ### by using the Find a Lawyer" feature and search under the "Personal Injury" and "Medical Malpractice" categories.  Develop a ### of perhaps five potential ### then reach out to at least three of them and request an initial consultation on your issue.

The doctor made cuts and holes but had a tech make holes as well. I was blindfolded but I know he worked on one side while the other person did the other. I was told the doctor would solely do himself. I feel staff also wasnâ€™t medically trained or certified in assisting surgery, after talking to them during the procedure, which also is apparent from the results. I feel I was lied to I also paid for a certain amount of grafts and another doctor told me that I didn't receive near the amount I paid for. Although thatâ€™s near impossible to prove.

Thankyou 44459.7020833333 ###-I hope this email finds you well.  Yes, you are obligated to report the inheritance as an asset for Medicaid purposes.  The definition of a countable asset under Medicaid includes cash (so even if you hide it under your mattress and don't put all of it in your bank account, it counts as an asset), stocks, bonds, investments, IRAs, credit union, savings, checking accounts, and real estate in which the applicant does not reside.  There are other assets that do not count towards your total assets for Medicaid purposes - personal belongings, household furnishings, an automobile, irrevocable burial trusts, and one's primary home (but only if that home is where the applicant lives or intends to return to it and the applicant's equity in the home is not greater than $603,000).  When applying for Medicaid, the state will look back for the past ### (from the application date) to ensure no assets were sold or given away under fair market value.  If a violation of the look back rule is found, it is assumed it was done to meet Medicaid's asset limit, and there will be a penalty period during which one is ineligible for Medicaid and fees are assessed. If one is already on Medicaid, there is a requirement to report a change in circumstance (such as receipt of inheritance).  Medicaid will view the inheritance as unearned income, and will result in ineligibility in the month it is received.  However, if the money is spent entirely during the month of receipt and without violating the look back rule, one will be eligible again the following month.  There are various ways one can spend down an inheritance in a way that does not violate the look back rule, including paying off debt, paying for long ### care, making home modifications/additions for safety and accessibility purposes, purchasing an irrevocable funeral trust to prepay for ### costs, and buying assets that are exempt from the asset limit (see first paragraph for examples).Have you spoken with a Medicaid Planner?  See here for a form that will put you in touch with a Certified Medicaid Planner who can help with strategies for maintaining Medicaid eligibility even with receipt of the inheritance: https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/fmp-form/See here for a helpful resource from the American Council on Aging on the impact of receiving an inheritance on Medicaid eligibility: https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/inheritance/ See here for NC-specific rules and eligibility thresholds for Medicaid: https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/medicaid-eligibility-north-carolina/Hope this is helpful.  Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions.  44530.9548611111 I am essentially disabled and trying to apply for Medicaid, which requires I submit a bank statement. I also have a charity care program from ###-affiliated hospitals, which requires the same. For the past year I lived in my momâ€™s house as her caretaker until she died of cancer. Since, I have lived off of a $###. That is almost gone. In the next few months, Iâ€™m going to have to cash in my momâ€™s retirement policy, which is currently around $###.I feel like Iâ€™m caught in a legal Catch 22. If I put that money in my bank account, I wonâ€™t be approved for Medicaid nor the ### program, â€”so, unable to afford medical care, and I will die. If I donâ€™t cash it, Iâ€™ll be approved for both, but will be living under a nearby bridge, with similar results.Friends state the obvious: cash the check, put some in my bank account, and hide the rest under my mattress.

While we cannot say for certain whether you could actually win a lawsuit against the doctor, what you describe in detail here is serious enough that it merits a closer look by a medical malpractice lawyer, who can consult with you and review your related medical records, and then provide you with a preliminary opinion as to whether you have a strong claim, and if so, what its likely monetary value is if you settle the case, or win an award in court (whether by a judge's summary judgment order or by a jury verdict).  Many if not all medical malpractice lawyers offer free initial consults, so there is no harm in reaching out to several practices and gauging their interest in your matter.  I strongly encourage you to do so.Basically, you would need to prove that the doctor provided you a standard of care that was below the minimum standard for similarly trained physicians in your area of the medical community, and that as a result of such deficient care, you suffered damages.Try visiting ### and using the Find a Lawyer" feature.  Search by NC town/city under the "Medical Malpractice" practice area category.  Reach out to a few ### once you have a strong ### of potential good fits.  I hope that one or more of these lawyers can give you a strong accurate and precise rendering of the potential claim you might assert.God bless you in health of body spirit and mind and in your financial personal and professional lives this fall.  May wonderful things come to you soon."44471.8673611111 I was in a car accident on ### and was flown by Eastcare to ### Medical Center in ###, NC.  I had multiple injuries including fractures of my right great toe and second toe, and two lacerations to my right leg.  I went to the OR on ### for surgical repair of my toes and to wash and clean and staple my leg ###s.  Dr. Koerner, the orthopedic surgeon,  had a hard splint placed and fully wrapped, covering the ###.  I was told that the dressing would remain in place until my first follow up, which they had already scheduled for ###.  I asked several different doctors and nurses about looking at my leg lacerations and was told by all that the dressing had to stay on and that it was fine for it to stay on that long since it was done in the OR.  I am a nurse and I have never heard of any such thing.  ###s should be assessed daily.  The toes were a different story.  They could be seen and evaluated through the opening in the end of the splint.  On ###, I had my follow up with Dr Koerner.  He was happy with the way my toes were progressing but was shocked to see that the laceration on my ### ### was badly infected.   Dr Koerner told me that I would have to be careful with this ### and keep my blood sugar under control or I was going to need an amputation.  He ordered Home Health to come in and do dressing changes two days a week.  He mentioned a referral to a ### specialist but didn't think I needed it at that time.  He prescribed antibiotics and pain medicine and then let me go.  Since that visit, I have had several hospitalizations for breathing problems related to my accident, COVID-19, and my last admission for severely infected leg ###.My leg ### continues to worsen.  I did see a ### specialist yesterday and I will be following up with him weekly.  I'm hoping and praying that he can save my leg from amputation.  I feel like this didn't have to happen.  Had my leg been assessed while I was in the hospital for ###, I don't believe that the laceration would have ended up like this.  I feel like the doctor was negligent in leaving the splint and dressing in place for so long without checking my ###s.  I have experienced pain and suffering at a high level.I want to sue Dr Koerner but am unsure under what grounds.  Does this sound like I have grounds for a law suit?Thank you44471.2395833333 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  Based on what you wrote in your attached fact summary, you really need to consult with a medical malpractice lawyer, who can provide you a much more precise and accurate answer about a possible legal claim than is possible on a basic Q&A site like this one.  Having volunteered on this website for almost five years, I am confident that none of the lawyers who regularly answer questions on this site are experts in medical malpractice, so it would be a serious risk for any of us--no matter how talented or competent we might be in other areas--to tell you for certain whether you have a case.  You have raised some serious points here, and I believe that an experienced medical malpractice lawyer would be interested in looking at this more closely--with recourse to the pertinent medical records.The most attention will be paid to whether the care received fell below industry standards for doctors of similar training in a similar medical/professional community, and whether there was a sufficient link between a failure to meet a medical standard of care, and the injuries suffered.  While this sounds straightforward, when it comes to making out a case in court, it is much more complex than would appear.I noticed when reading your fact summary that this was prepared for the review of ### ###; is she currently reviewing your case?  If so, she is far better situated to give definite advice than any of us on NC Free Legal Answers.  You can also seek a second and third opinion by submitting this document to other medical malpractice lawyers, along with any medical records that they request as a part of their initial inquiry into your case.On ###, you can use the Find a Lawyer" feature to search for lawyers in certain ### in NC under the "Medical Malpractice" practice area category.

The doctor has changed my diagnosis without discussion nor discussed that a patient contract would be involved. I believe Iâ€™m being labeled a difficult patient, due to ### of the practice, poor communication, and weird billing. 44480.8 Mr. ###: You have not really presented any legal question here.  It is unlikely that the doctor is taking kickbacks" for medication given the intense scrutiny of doctors' prescriptions in light of new legislation in the wake of the opioid litigation.  If you suggest that the doctor is taking "kickbacks" that may be viewed as an attack on their professional integrity and may contribute to a doctor finding you difficult. It is good to advocate for yourself but there may be things outside of the doctors' control such as weird billing. You certainly do not have to sign any contract if you are not comfortable but is there another care provider who may be a better fit? It is wonderful you are seeking the help you need and it sounds like you may have reached an impasse with this particular doctor. You have not asked a legal question and only a care provider can help you determine what is best for you. Best of luck with this.

I don't think that's fair if my son assists with home's maintenance and purchase. So ###) I want to protect home from Medicaid. ###) I NEED my benefits. And ###) I NEED son's financial assistance to help cover home-ownership costs. Right now we figure that I'll require $###00-$###/or mortgage payments above and beyond my financial capabilities. I've also heard there are "trusts" that can be set up to manage this scenario. So how much does it cost to set up a trust what type of trust is recommended do I do this BEFORE or AFTER purchasing a home? Or do I just say forget it and live in my car because I can't AFFORD to live anywhere except some hole in the wall in Ohio? Thanks for any response!

Since you and your husband have been living separate for more than one year, then the assets of the one NOT going to a nursing home will NOT be counted in determining Medicaid eligibility for the one going to the nursing home.Neither a nursing home nor Medicaid can take your home while you are on Medicaid in a nursing home.  However, after your death, your house may need to be sold to pay back Medicaid.  There are a number of ways to protect the house in that situation, but they are complicated and you will need to consult an elder law attorney to help you do that.44543.7881944444 My husband and I were legally separated in 2012.My husband wants a divorce to protect is home and car from Medicaid if he gets very sick and goes into a home.

I dress myself in the clothes that I brought and I was instructed to follow a  nursing assistant through  the doors to end my stay.

I stopped and politely said  Am I not  supposed to be discharged by a nurse and I have not signed any paperwork and also stated no one has  gone over my discharge information with me?  Immediately the nurse assistant went to get a male nurse that was  behind a ### in protected area.  The male nurse  came out to see me with papers in his hand. He didn't  introduce himself to me  and was red om the face.  As he approached me I said to him were you  guys going to discharge me without going over any discharge information with me  and not have me sign paperwork that I understood the plan of care for me for discharge? Immediately the guy nurse with blond hair said you can leave the emergency department shoved   some papers into my hand aggressivel and  continued postering me with a red face saying  you could leave or youâ€™ll be ###. I said I am not leaving until you discharge me appropriately and I have a right to be informed about my care and provided verbal and written material  information regarding  the care given to me  inpatient and recommendations as I am becoming outpatient status I continued and stared I'm not even understanding what I'm suppose to be doing on this discharge and I feel I deserve respectable care and appropriate care from start to finish. The guy nurse called UN C security police  and within minutes two   officers arrived. At first i felt released and safe thinking these individuals would advocate for me in disseminating what was ### very quickly.  I attempted to explain the same information I just stated to the male nurse and many stading around me in witness. Suddenly  the security officer said you need to leave sir! ;  I said I'm not leaving until I'm discharged  that's my patient right.. By that time for more officers arrived approximately ###  took me By the arms  and shoved and pushed and pulled me out of the ER through the corredorâ€™s past other ancillary staff in the emergency room.

My wife was sent to ### Regional Medical Center (### Health owned) by her primary care physician for server pneumonia symptoms to get treatment she needed to survive. ### Regional didnâ€™t admit her, and her primary doctor stated that she would have received the care she desperately needed if she was vaccinated for Covid 19. She was not admitted, and still needed professional medical care. We had to seek treatment elsewhere, and out of network. Her doctor stated that she could have died if she didnâ€™t get treatment. Another bad aspect of the situation is that my wife is not only a patient of ### Health, but also an employee. And ### wouldnâ€™t even look after one of their own employees. We have heard other ### stories that were similar to ours, but have ended tragically. All because they are treating vaccinated people and basically ignoring unvaccinated people. The only reason my wife wasnâ€™t vaccinated is because she has Multiple ###, and was communicating with her neurologist to determine if the vaccination would be helpful or harmful.  We have names, dates, and reports emphasizing her vaccination status from the doctors report from ### Regional hospital.

Do you have any advice or tips? We donâ€™t even know where to begin with this process. Thank you. 43921.9729166667 First, I am sorry that you find yourself in this situation during the pandemic.  Itâ€™s such a trying and stressful time. As for the doctor refusing to allow you to bring your child with you to the appointment, the office has the right to do that.  During this pandemic, there are various guidelines that businesses have implemented in order to protect employees and customers.  Restricting who can attend a doctorâ€™s appointment and who can accompany the patient are common measures being taken to protect patients, doctors, and staff.    I wish you a healthy and safe pregnancy.43973.73125 I have a ### ### ###.My daughters father and I are not together and he has not been super involved. We were never married and never went to court so I have full custody of her, and I watch her under my care ###. I allow him to see her/etc. but he chooses to very seldom out of his own choice. He pays me child support every month and weâ€™ve been separated since she was ###. We were living together but now Iâ€™m living with my mom and her husband temporarily till I can get my own housing.  I donâ€™t have much family that lives in Massachusetts.  I have asked her father to watch her during my pre-needle appointment however he said he was leaving Cape Cod and wouldnâ€™t tell me where he was going and told me that he wasnâ€™t going to be around for a while.   My mom is an essential worker and she works Monday through Friday during the day and she canâ€™t get a day off until a month ahead of time.  As you can see I have no one to watch my daughter during my prenatal appointment so the only place I could bring her to an emergency childcare where she would be exposed to children of essential workers or a random babysitter that I have no time to screen and trust.  Her doctors office will not allow me to bring her in even though sheâ€™s ###â€™m the only person sheâ€™s with all the time.   My opinion if I put her in a daycare or a babysitter sheâ€™s going to be exposed to more people which in turn will expose me which in turn will expose their whole office as well.  So this policy makes no sense for me and I just wanted to know if they legally were allowed to refuse my daughter to come into my appointment with me. The next office I can go to with my insurance is an hour away and Iâ€™m doing this pregnancy alone and I donâ€™t think I will be able to do all of this traveling especially towards the end of my pregnancy.  The second baby I am carrying has the same father of the first but again he just refuses to help and thatâ€™s not something I can change.  He has offered his mom to watch her however she has only met my daughter twice and I donâ€™t know if I can trust her with my daughter  I just donâ€™t feel that itâ€™s fair for them to refuse me to bring my child he was only expose me into my appointments during the quarantine and force her to go to an emergency daycare or a stranger. Iâ€™m not sure what to do but I feel as though this is not rightThank you for your time. 43952.7201388889 Am I legally obligated to continue paying for my daughters health insurance after she is emancipated at the age of 23. 43998.6888888889 Teh Affordable Care Act gives you the right to keep your daughter on our health insurance until age 26.

In regards to the Medical Board, I did need to disclose specific info (according to them). Aside from that, I am writing professionally about these issues (https://www.madinamerica.com/2020/09/addiction-treatment-how-many-meds/). I'm pretty sure I'm within legal rights to do so in the way I am doing it (without naming clients or facilities), but wanted clarity on that...Does that make sense? I am meeting with the Massachusetts State Medical Board in the next week or two to discuss a formal compliant I issued. It's my first time doing something like that. Do you know if I need to have my own lawyer present for a meeting like that? They want to discuss the complaint I filed. Thank you for your time and expertise. It's appreciated!Sincerely, ### Lundgren 44126.9152777778 Hi ###, It's such an important issue. I have experience in my personal life, seeing relatives who would seem to me to be over-medicated. It's not clear to me from your question whether you are actually talking about disclosing PHI, and if you are, why disclosing PHI would be necessary for the purposes you are proposing. I'll assume you're covered by HIPAA in the context you're working in. HIPAA regulates the disclosure of protected health information (PHI). The general rule is you can't disclose PHI unless you meet an exception. Regarding your question (###), I would say it is possible that sharing PHI in that context could fit under an exception. However, I would think the best approach would be to bring your concerns to the Board without disclosing PHI and let the Board determine if it wants to acquire any PHI itself in the course of its investigation, assuming there is one. I don't see from the question why sharing PHI up front would be necessary.On your question (###), you don't provide much detail, and at the moment I'm not ### a context outside of the medical facility where sharing PHI would be appropriate. Maybe you had something specific in mind?I hope this is a little helpful. Feel free to write back with further information or questions.Kind regards,###44126.0215277778 Hi ###,Keep in mind that if you are writing about particular cases, there are requirements and standards for de-identifying PHI. You want to be very careful that you do not inadvertently identify a patient. You may be aware of some research in the field of re-identification of ### or anonymous data sets. In many cases it takes less information than you might expect. Also, you may have non-disclosure agreements with facilities where you have worked, and those could have terms that go beyond HIPAA requirements.As for meeting with the Board, I do not have experience there. It's probably not a requirement that you have your own attorney. However, if it were me, I'd want to have one with me who has experience before the Board.Good luck!###44126.9243055556 I am an addiction recovery advocate and speaker; working in the addiction treatment field. Some of the things I'm seeing - concern me - regarding the excessive use, and dangerous combination, of psychiatric medications. I'm not a Doctor; but I am an addiction treatment Professional. The research I have done validates the problems, and outcomes, I'm seeing from these problems. My questions is ###:###) When filing a complaint with the Massachusetts State Medical Board, how much information can I legally provide? i.e. without being legally bound to HIPAA laws...###) When discussing my professional experience and opinion (not as a Doctor), how much information can I share without violating HIPAA?Thank you very much,### Lundgren 44099.6458333333 I'd consider whether you risk revealing information to anyone who doesn't already have it. 44129.6201388889 In theory, that should be fine, as long as there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual." But I'd be very careful that there's not something unique in the context that could identify the patient. For example what if the "this happened" is something that people would recognize as a unique event? You might find this DHS page interesting: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html"44127.0256944444 It's not a legal thing. It's about whether you've implicitly identified a patient. I'll try to make up an example.  I saw an individual prescribed Suboxone and Gabapentin at the same time and then they fell off a ladder and landed on their dog and both were hospitalized." It's a silly example but the point is there are people out there who could probably identify the patient based on that since it's such a unique occurrence.

HIPAA protections apply to current and former patients.Details may be relevant, however, so I would have a number of questions as to your specific case, including for example:Are the employees tagging former clients from their personal Facebook accounts or the ### account? Do the employees have personal relationships with these clients outside of the program?How exactly are they tagging them? What kind of content?How exactly are they being identified as patients -- directly or by implication?Regards,###44104.7319444444 Hi,Just want to clarify if an early intervention program can let employees tag former clients in a Facebook post/on social media identifying them as former clients (parents of a child that was in the program)?Health insurance is billed for all services and each client has a medical record.Is this considered disclosing PHI/ a HIPAA violation because you identified that they were in the early intervention program without their express written consent?Do HIPAA protections expire when a client leaves the program?Any clarification you could provide would be greatly appreciated!!Thanks,###44100.0013888889 Hi,Thank you so much for your response!! A staff member posted on their personal Facebook page asking for donations to a fundraiser for our program. The program was identified in the post, and it also asked for donations from former Early Intervention families" with former clients tagged underneath. So to answer the first question it was from a personal account that also named and tagged our program in the post along with former clients. My understanding is that the relationship between the former client and employee is through our program the employee provided services for the child and family when they were in the program and they became Facebook friends.They were tagged by name in the post after they were identified as "former early intervention families" and our program name and current fundraiser were also included in the post.After an email went out ### this as a marketing strategy I became concerned that other staff would follow suit and do the same thing in their Facebook posts basically doxying former clients and posting that they and their child were in our program without first getting written consent because identifying them by name in connection with our program could be considered disclosing PHI. From my research even if the post is on an employee's personal social media page if PHI (names) are disclosed in connection with our program it's a HIPAA violation. I replied to the email ### the Facebook post as great marketing and just asked if they had considered HIPAA when using social media. They responded rather disingenuously by trying to say that former clients weren't named and it was "just a bunch of random people" tagged in the post even though I had seen the post and it clearly identified them as former early intervention clients...and they had the employee deleted the post almost immediately after I sent my email about it being a possible HIPAA violation. My understanding is that this would be a clear HIPAA violation and I just wanted to make sure my understanding is correct if I have to follow up about this.Any guidance you have is great appreciated!!Thanks again ###"44104.8201388889 My pleasure. All the best!-###44104.9520833333 Thank you so much for your quick response!I completely agree, if it's not an actual HIPAA violation, it's definitely inappropriate, clients should be able to self-determine if they want the information that they were formerly in early intervention shared on social media!Part of the issue is that there is no formal social media policy, and I don't think there is anyone in charge of HIPAA at the program, and I don't think they realized we need someone to be, or that we are considered a health care provider and need to be HIPAA compliant. Our CEO of ###. Its never been mentioned before and we've never had any kind of HIPAA training. I gently suggested a social media policy be developed in addition to HIPAA trainings, so they are aware now. I'm not sure if they will follow through with this, which is on them to take responsibility for if there is ever an issue. Just trying to prevent children from loosing critical services because the agency closes due to the financial fees that can come with HIPAA violations, but if that happens it's on the higher ups for not addressing it!ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸Thanks so much for all your advice, I truly appreciate it!! ###44104.8611111111 This is not a venue where I can give a definitive answer on whether that was or was not a HIPAA violation. It would be a very fact-specific exercise. For example, another thought I just had is whether it could make a difference whether the former clients had themselves given some public indication that they were client, i.e. by liking a page or something. That said, from what you have described, it does sound inappropriate to me. If I were in charge of HIPAA at that program, I would have a social media policy and would prohibit exactly that kind of behavior, maybe with some exceptions for cases where the client initiates contact and/or gives consent. It really should be up to the client as to whether they want to be identified as a former client, or associated in any way publicly with the program.44104.8423611111 I was seeing a DR out of the Baystate Health system for ### disc disorder.  I was at Athol ER several times because I was in so much pain, I was treated with percocet and given a prescription for these.  I had a follow up with my PCP wo refused to continue the prescription and said he wouldn't prescribe pain meds for me.  I filed a complaint with MA Board of Medicine (I had been to ER for pain several times already).

I was discharged and could not be seen.   The DR ### my prescription for the month of September but now I'm out of meds and scrambling to get into a doctor.   Under these circumstances can the DR legally discharge me and/or does he have any legal obligation to continue my prescription until I secure an appt. with a new DR (besides my pain returning being off this med I am at risk for withdrawals which could be a concern as I had a stroke five years ago).

On December ### I had the Gastric Sleeve done and ever since then, I've had nothing but problems.  I don't trust the original surgeon.

I had an upper GI by a doctor at ### & Wommen's which shows I have I hiatal hernia.  Between that and the GERD being so bad, the motility specialist, Dr. Iturrino, said that she felt that the ONLY way to help was to deal with the hernia and then give me the upgrade to the full bypass.  She contacted the bariatric GI to let him know as well as Dr. ###. I went to go and try to make a follow-up with Dr. ###.

I'm ###, a 2nd-year college student in the Boston area and I've been living on-campus for the last month and a half. Before coming to campus this semester, my university(Berklee College of Music) charged me $###,###. I paid this charge and expected to have active health insurance when I arrived on campus. However, yesterday, I went to refill my prescription for ### at a pharmacy and I was told that the insurance account that I was provided was not active.After hearing this, I called the health insurance company(Massachusetts Blue Cross Blue Shield). They told me that my account had been declared inactive since ###th, ###. They then transferred me to a call with the company that handles the ### health insurance accounts(Gallagher Health) and I was told that the college had never notified them to reactivate my account despite the fact that I had paid the premiums for the entire semester. After this conversation, the company is now working on reactivating my account.I must point out that the semester is now 25% over with it being week ### ###6. Essentially, I've been studying, living and even working as a resident assistant for the college on-campus since ###rd, without any health coverage whatsoever. It is also worth mentioning that all of this has happened during a pandemic and due to the high density of college students living in a small area, I have been at an elevated risk of infection and need of medical services.I want to make it clear that I have not talked to the school's bursar office yet about the situation as I wanted to have a better understanding of my options before I started sharing information with them.Questions:What are my options legally? - I currently have no desire for litigation and I'm currently not expecting any money out of this situation besides at least a refund for the 25% of the plan that was not activated during my time here. However, I imagine that there must be some laws in place to address situations like these and I want to see the school penalized for potentially, for a lack of better words, screwing me and possibly others over.Am I entitled to a refund? - I think that it is reasonable to demand a refund on the part of the policy that was not active during the semester. However, I'm not sure if I am actually entitled to such a thing.Are there better ways to resolve this without an attorney? - I'm a ###. I can't realistically afford an attorney if I don't absolutely need one.

Thanks!-###ander(###) ###44245.7805555556 Hi ###,what a frustrating situation! I know it seems like this mistake by the University in failing to reactivate your health insurance account should result in a refund for the time you were technically uncovered, but it probably doesn't. The reason is that your actual damages would only potentially be the expenses that you had to pay out of pocket that should have been covered by the insurance policy. The what might have happened" is not actually compensable because it did not occur.The best way to approach this is to contact the Bursar's office to get the policy reinstated retroactive to the beginning of the semester so that the insurance pays out the appropriate costs. Alternatively they could get the insurance policy in place going forward and just reimburse your out-of-pocket costs. Either way I would expect this to be something you could resolve with them without having to involve an attorney. If you can't get anywhere with the right offices at Berklee they probably also have an Ombudsman's office whose job it is to help work out disputes within the community.Hope this helps and good luck to you in your studies! ###"44249.6590277778 Hi!Thank you so much for the advice.

I have already spent/lost/invested the following funds into this surgery--$767.###:$### (receipts/debit documentation can be provided)$### (documentation of my absence and required sub can be provided)###.### $###=$157.50 (all teacher absences documented by school district)At least $###.**This is not to mention the time, effort, and some aspects of humiliation (including a required full psychological evaluation) to pursue this procedure.I am also being charged but am not yet paying on :MU Health System--$108###.12MU Physicians--$237. 65I was notified that my surgery was not approved in January of ###.  I immediately contacted my insurance (United Healthcare) and was informed that they had no record of anyone ever calling to preauthorize the surgery because had they done so it would have been declined in July of ###.  I faxed an appeal in both January and February of ###.  Since February I have been in contact with both MU Bariatric Services and then MU Guest Services one to several times monthly and still do not have a resolution to this situation.  At the very least, I am seeking a full refund of moneys paid, as well as a reversal of all fees.  I also feel it fair that they should reimburse my lost wages and other moneys spent.  I am unsure if I have a case beyond this.  I am a school teacher with a disabled husband and so this amount of money is a tremendous loss to us for the negative return.  43978.8159722222 My wife recieved a summons at her fathers house in ###. We live in Missouri. She has horrible anxiety and no one will speak with me long enough to figured out what she needs to do to insurance she does not get in any trouble with the law. I am just trying to make a stressful situation a little easier on my wife. 43994.7319444444 Sorry for the stressful situation. Best thing to do is hire a lawyer. That way the lawyer can handle it and keep the stress to a minimum. Please don't wait too long or ignore it or the other side will get a judgment for the full amount.

Who do I talk to?44003.0284722222 This response is more a practical response as opposed to a legal one. I suggest you contact the doctor that provided the diagnosis and make your request there. You did not set out your reason for the requested change but you should send a letter setting all the reasons and support for your requested change and see what happens. You might first contact the hospital and see if it has a patient advocate" or similar titled person you can talk to about your request. Good luck and stay well. "44003.5930555556 Dear Mr. ###,You did not indicate how long ago you purchased this policy. The link you provided to a description of the policy coverage does not seem to require that your children be named on the application, only your spouse.  (See Page 9 - Dependent")  However there may be other rules regarding coverage not in the general brochure.  I do not know what documents and correspondence you have received over the years concerning this coverage so it is really impossible to determine if you have a viable cause of action against the company. You could start by filing a complaint with the Missouri Department of Insurance if you have not already done so.  LINK:  https://insurance.mo.gov/consumers/But it is likely you are going to need to hire a good private attorney for advice and representation.  The assistance you need is beyond the scope of this ### forum.  Best wishes."44011.1430555556 I purchased a individual critical illness" policy from Aflac over the phone. At the time of purchase I was told that the policy would cover dependent children at 50% of my individual benefit at no extra charge to me. I provided my childrens information to the sales agent at that time. In ### this year my daughter was diagnosed with a ### disease that caused her to suffer multiple strokes. I believed she would be eligible for some benefit based on my understanding of the policy but when I filed a claim I was told that the sales agent did not include her on my policy and the claim was denied. I called the sales agent but that company claims that since the policy is "active" they cannot do anything about it. I contacted Aflac customer service but they state that the only thing I could do is add my dependent children to my existing policy for an additional premium and the coverage would not be retroactive. Please advise.https://www.aflac.com/aps/herc/docs/herc-ci.pdfCHILD COVERAGE AT NO ADDITIONAL COST Each dependent child is covered at ###â€™s benefit amount at no additional charge. Children-only coverage is not available."44011.0166666667 God bless you! Thank you! An advocate would be very helpful!!44014.7444444444 Last year I tried to get my ###. I worked with a woman named Lilah Brevik. I felt that she was not very helpful at all. Nor did I feel that she wanted us to even get a case manager. My son was denied. It was so difficult and she was so difficult I did not try again. However it has become apparent that without a case manager to get my son the proper help he needs, he is going to end up dead. So I have been attempting to work with this Lilah Brevik again and she is making things so incredibly difficult that i feel she does not have my sons best interests in mind and it feels as though she is purposely making things so difficult that we either stop trying or get denied. She is the intake worker at Comtrea for DMH I guess. I feel she is prejudice against me or my son or both of us and when I have talked to others about her, they also have said it sounds like she is trying to make things so difficult that we cannot get my son a case manager. (without me saying that out loud to them) So it is not just me. Can I request another intake worker? And why do I have to work so hard to prove my son was diagnosed with autism before age ###? You don't suddenly develop it after ###. You are born with it. Also I have papers for days with doctors saying he has autism, among other things, but it is not good enough. I'm scared if I don't get him a case manager I am going to lose him.44014.1583333333 You havenâ€™t actually asked a legal question that I can answer as â€œwhat rights does he haveâ€ is too broad. That said I am looking into what options or assistance might be available to you in getting him a case manager. I will let you know what I find out.One possible source for assistance, or at least information about possible sources, is the National Alliance for Mental Illness (###). The local organization is ### StL. You might try contacting them yourself. I believe they have access to organizations that provide advocates to assist you in getting a case manager.I know this is tough but hang in there!44014.6590277778 My husband was having some problems that needed attention. The police transported him to the hospital where his mother and I were signing papers to have him admitted. A nurse came to us and told us that they didn't have the staff for behavioral health so they were transporting him to a different hospital. They said we would have to take the signed affadavits to the other hospital but that we could see if the sheriff's department could do it for us. They said no so I took them to the hospital he was supposed to be at. When I got there they told me that he was at the 1st hospital because that's where the patient requested and they shouldn't have refused him service. I called the 1st hospital and asked them to not release him because I was on my way back from where they had sent me to give them the affidavits. they said okay but released him anyway. Now we are in a different legal matter because the hospital didn't give him the care he needed. Is there anything we can do about the mix-up with hospital? 44043.6833333333 Sounds like a mess. Sorry you had to go through it. The main question is, Did the failure to admit him cause him any harm that a doctor can testify about?Did he get treatment after that and what did the second hospital do for him?If no real damages I might just let it go since you likely don't want to spend money on a matter unless it resulted in serious damage to your husband.Good luck and stay well. Hope this helps. "44043.8479166667 Back in February I had a blood clot from my knee to my ankle and my physician told me to go straight to the E R after seeing my scan results. I also had pulmonary embolism.  I have a letter from my doctor that she wrote for my appeal saying that I  needed to go straight to the ER. My insurance company, ###, still denied the claim. They told me it was because the hospital coded it as in patient instead of an emergency. I  tried to get the hospital to ### the ### coded as emergency and they said they can't do that because I was admitted. The hospital ### is over $16, 500. My question is do I even have a case or should  I  just see if they will let me make payments over time? Thank you for your time. 44077.8215277778 Clearly it should cover the ER. Why did you get admitted if that hospital was not in your network? Have you talked to St. Lukes to ask them why they admitted you when you were not covered?44077.98125 First thing they do is ask for your insurance card when you check in.  I did ask later why they didn't tell me that they were out of network and they said it is illegal for them to tell people that they are out of network. 44078.0493055556 Good morning, On my final notice ### they reduced it from over $22,### $16,###. I have already called and asked them to re send a  ### to ### coded as an emergency and they told me they can not do that.  I have tried to call St. Lukes this morning before I emailed you back but had to leave a message. I was going to tell them what you said about not expecting to be paid since they admitted me knowing I was out of network and unless they ### ### as an emergency they should not expect me to pay. They offered to reduce the amount due to my income and want two months of checking account information and my last  year tax return but I just don't feel like I should owe this other than my deductible which I am more than willing  to pay. Any other suggestions for when I do get hold of them today? Thank you so much for your help. I have called several lawyers  in my area and none of them seem to handle anything like this. 44082.6208333333 I do have emergency room coverage but ### denied it as a medical emergency. See attachment I was admitted at St ### which is also where I  went to the ER.St. ### is out of network for me which I actually didn't realize but I  called ### a few months before this happened to see where I should go in case of an emergency and they told me if it was an emergency I could go to any hospital.I chose St. ### because it was literally across the street from where I  was at getting the scan. 44077.8986111111 If they had coded it right your insurance company would have paid the ER ###. Tell them you will only be able to pay the deductible unless they correct it with your insurance company. It was either an emergency or not. I would not give them that info until you come to an agreement in writing as to the amount they will charge. The agreement can be subject to you showing them that you are in poor financial shape. Also, they should only charge you what the insurance company would have paid, not the retail price. Keep on them.44082.9104166667 Sorry for the messy situation.I have a few questions that I need answered to clarify so I can give you an answer.Do you not have coverage for an emergency room visit on your plan?Do you have a copy of your plan?Were you seen in the ER and then admitted at that hospital or another?Is St. Lukes in your network?How did you choose St. Lukes?This will help get us started. 44077.8638888889 Whether or not that is true, they knew you were out of network so they should understand that they have a problem. As far as payment, you should tell them that as a result of their decision to admit you knowing you were out of network, they will need to adjust the ### so that you are only charged what you would have owed if you were in network. See what the response is to that and let me know. They also need to re### the charges for the ER so that your plan will pay those. If they do not do so, they cannot expect you to pay. Let me know and stay well. 44078.6215277778 I checked covid because it was used as an excuse. I have ###. I need (not a luxury; a med. requirement) monthly PT/INRs.

Check with your insurance company as to how to handle the referral problem.44078.6715277778 My pleasure.  My answer wasnt' really a legal answer but if it helps you solve your problem that would be great.44078.7791666667 Thank you. I didn't think to contact Medicaid. I've explained the situation and am waiting for a reply.44078.7527777778 Ebony,Thanks for posting your question.  I'm sorry you've had to go through this struggle.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure it is really a legal issue.  It sounds like you got very poor service from your doctor, but it's unclear whether it rises to the level of medical malpractice."  It sounds like rather than looking to sue him you probably just need to find another physician.  If he wasn't responding to you from the gitgo rather than keep trying to contact him and getting no response I'd suggest that you find another doctor.  A physician does not have to keep you on as a patient if they don't want to.  I'd suggest focusing your efforts on getting another doctor.Having said that if the doctor said he'd so something but then didn't do it and blew a deadline for you and it caused you damage you MAY have a medical malpractice case against him but it's doubtful that an attorney would take on such a case due to the low level of damages involved.Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but I often have to tell people that the law isn't always the solution and I think this is one of those times.Good luck in finding a new doctor!###"44105.5333333333 Iâ€™m under the care of my doctor for anxiety depression and migraines.

The active ingredients in the generics all must be the same but the other elements in the medication can be different. As a result, some folks have difficulty with the changes resulting from the different manufacturers of generic medications. If you are one of those that are susceptible to the minor differences between different manufacturers then you need to have your physician prescribe only the non-generic medication. While all of these medications will work fine, the only way to ensure that you do not deal with different manufacturers is by only getting the name brand. That is of course typically going to be more expensive.As for your pharmacy, I do not see that you have any basis for any type of claim against the pharmacy provided that it filled the prescription the way that the physician prescribed it.44130.75625 I've been taking this medication ### for the last ###44130.7493055556 I was wondering if a person could sue a doctor for performing an abortion on them.

You indicated that you presented to the Emergency Department with suicidal thoughts and were placed in the behavioral health unit (BHU). It is standard practice to take all cell phones from patients while in the BHU so there is nothing unusual or improper about them doing so. It is also standard practice to take all medications away from a patient to ensure that the only medications being administered are those being prescribed by the hospital physician and supplied by the hospital pharmacy. As for the hospital not disclosing to your brother that you were a patient, that is what the hospital is required to do as a result of HIPAA which protects Private Health Information. The bottom line, nothing that you have described suggests a basis for a viable lawsuit. However, if you wish to pursue the matter then I suggest that you contact a medical malpractice attorney to discuss your case more fully.44134.6486111111 It was suggested for me to contact an attorney regarding a recent ER visit.

I referenced HIPAA in connection with your brother not being told that you were a patient.When you are in the hospital that physician is going to make all of the decisions regarding what medication you are to be on. Your normal physician technically has no say in the matter. I have always found it very frustrating that it is handled this way but it has been that way for every hospitalization that my child has had with Behavioral Health. So the fact that you may have been taking something else with your own doctor isn't a basis for a malpractice claim.What I see in looking through your posts is that you had a difficult hospital stay but that you have survived without any long-term injuries so you lack the kind of damages which are required to justify the risk of a medical malpractice suit. The out of pocket costs in expert fees, etc. routinely exceed $50,###. Hospitals and doctors win over ###% of the time at trial. Absent some serious damages would you take on a case that required you to spend $50,### 10% of the time? Perhaps you have sustained more in the way of actual damages as a result of this incident than I see from your posts. Like I said in my first response, if you feel that you have a case then you should contact a medical malpractice attorney to discuss the viability of your case. Such attorneys do not charge you to look at or hear about your case so there is no reason to keep you from doing so. I have already given you my impression but I no longer handle medical malpractice cases so what you need to do is contact an attorney that handles these and see if they will take the case.I wish you the best of luck.44134.9229166667 I received a crown from a dental company ###. ###, it became loose and fell off.

Unless you were provided a written document showing the terms of a warranty then I donâ€™t know what proof you would be able to show that you weâ€™re entitled to any warranty. If there was no written warranty, what would you show at court to prove your case if you were to sue.  If you can afford it, pay an attorney to write a letter on your behalf.  A good letter might get you the result you desire. 44152.0527777778 ###,Thanks for the prompt response. I believe the best course of action is to consult a healthcare attorney experienced in prosecuting HIPAA violation cases. I note, however, that there is no private cause of action for violations of HIPAA or any of its regulations. In other words, you do not have a right to sue based on a violation of HIPAA by itself. You may sue based on Missouri law, but you would have to prove that you suffered an injury.What you can do is file a HIPAA privacy complaint with the federal government (Office of Civil Rights). At most, the federal government will assess a fine to the doctorâ€™s office, but you will get nothing out of this regulatory action.If you believe you have suffered a ### injury, your best option is to consult with an attorney. There are several attorneys offering free consultation and representation on a contingency basis. Be prepared to explain to the attorney what damages you suffered. Proving these damages is key if you decide to sue either the doctorâ€™s office or your ex-husbandâ€™s wife.I do not recommend suing pro se (meaning without an attorney), because HIPAA violation cases are complicated and you would do well to consult with an attorney to confirm if you have a case or not.I cannot make that evaluation for you through this website because I do not have access to all documents and additional information you may have. That is why it is imperative for you to seek an attorney experienced with HIPAA issues in your area. He or she will be in prime position to explain to you how judges in your county deal with these cases.Does that make sense? Bernardo44158.9597222222 Hi ###, My name is Bernardo and I will do my best to help you.As a preliminary matter, you must have access to your daughterâ€™s medical records. As a parent who has not had your parental rights removed by a court, you may review your daughterâ€™s medical records, including any scheduling information. I assume that the doctorâ€™s office is hesitant to give out information over the phone, in an attempt to avoid potential HIPAA violations, and have not realized they are committing a violation by withholding the information from you. I suggest you go in person to the doctorâ€™s office with your childâ€™s birth certificate and the custody order, and ask to review the medical records, including any signed authorization your ex-husband may have given his current wife, or any other HIPAA disclosures forms on file.When it comes to your daughterâ€™s stepmother having access to her medical records, the issue is more complicated. Either parent can sign an authorization for a stepparent to have a copy of the childâ€™s records or discuss the records with someone at the practice. It is a parental right to do so, and you cannot block your ex-husband from giving out this authorization. The question is: has he given this signed authorization to his wife? You need to inquire that with the doctorâ€™s office. As you may recall, sometimes in your first visit to the doctorâ€™s you authorize them to divulge information to others, and you can specify who that third-party is. Your ex-husband may have previously authorized the doctorâ€™s office to share this information with his current wife.If the wife signed as a parent of your daughter without your ex-husbandâ€™s authorization to do so, this may very well constitute a HIPAA violation. HIPAA states that a person who knowingly obtains or ### individually ### health information in violation of HIPAA ### a possible monetary fine and/or jail time. This could also qualify as fraud or impersonation under Missouri law. It is hard to predict though without knowing exactly what type of authorization, if any, she has from your ex-husband.Does this help? Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Best,Bernardo44158.8583333333 I have obtained all of the documentation of my daughters medical information. The ones that I have so far there was no authorization forms signed for her to bring her to the doctor. But they still gave her information and I have a recording of them giving her information over the phone. She has scheduled many appointments and brought her to the doctors office without that form being signed. My ex-husband has never went to any of the doctors appointments because he just doesnâ€™t do that so he never signed a form saying that she had a right to records or to bring her doctor. The two offices that I have attained the records from does not have her authorization at all I am waiting for two more that will be here within the next couple of weeks. I knew it was a HIPAA violation because I do work Hyppa every single day as a debt collector for hospitals. So how do I go about pursuing a lawsuit or suing her by signing her name as the mother Of my daughter?44158.8625 My ex-husband and I have joint physical legal custody of my daughter. However she lives with him the majority of the time.  My ex-husband has been out of town for four months for work out of the past six months. Without telling me. So theyâ€™ve been several times where his wife has taken my daughter to the doctor. Each time she schedules an appointment I ask that either I get to schedule it so it works for me or I can explain the hours that I would be available to take her to the doctor. Every time I have an appointment and I change my work schedule to take her to the appointment they change it. I called all of the doctors offices and none of them have authorization to make any appointments or have any access to her medical records. I have all documentation proving that this would be considered a HIPAA violation. His wife also signed her name as the mother of my child on some paperwork.She did not list my name at all. Would this be considered a HIPAA violation on every single facility that allowed her access to my daughters medical records? And with this also be a individual HIPAA violation on his wife for lying on the paperwork?44158.1770833333 If I have old hospital bills on my credit report, can I hav them removed due to the fact that I was approved for and currently have Medicaid? 44160.5159722222 If Medicaid has paid the hospital bills, then the hospital should update the credit reporting to show that the bills were paid, although late.  You should request that the balance be updated.  However late payment does not remove the item(s) from your credit report.However regardless of whether or not the old hospital bills were paid, being approved for Medicaid would have absolutely nothing to do with your credit report.

"44170.7097222222 Good morning Ms. ###,i am very sorry that you are facing these large premium increases. Unfortunately my research on this topic shows that Prudential and other companies did not properly estimate the cost of supporting the claims on these types of policies. And one ### insurance company even became insolvent. Insurance is regulated by state law; however, so your insurance company cannot raise your premiums without first getting approval from the Missouri Dept. of Ins. Therefore, while I believe that your premiums are almost certainly being increased â€œlegally,â€ you can call the Dept. of Ins. and make sure.Also I recommend that you call the agent who sold you the policy. You can ask that agent to call Prudential with you and work out the best options/benefit reductions should you plan to keep the policy. My understanding is that, even at the increased rates, these policies are still a great deal - if you can afford them. The average annual cost of care in a skilled nursing facility can be up to $100,### 10% of that.I am concerned about what you say your lifetime benefit is though. Please review that carefully with your agent as you may be struggling to pay premiums on a policy that wonâ€™t cover much in the future anyway.Finally, I recommend that you consult with an Elder Law or Estate Planning type of attorney. They can explain to you the options you/your family will have if you canâ€™t continue to afford this insurance coverage. For example, there is a safe harbor called Vendor Medicaid which pays for skilled nursing facilities when folks have limited savings or after those savings have been depleted.i know it seems very unfair that an insurance company can raise rates so drastically and so frequently - and that is why we have government oversight in this industry - but the alternative is claims not being paid if the company goes bankrupt.Take some time to think about the coverage you are getting for the continued rising cost and your alternatives. Talk to a trusted advisor or friend and then make your decision.Best wishes,### ###The ### Law Firn, Perryville, MO###-###We never charge for phone calls or office visits. 44173.6798611111 Thank you for your response and advice, as well as the service you are providing.

Fast forward to mid ###  (my healthcare provider through marketplace) that I would owe money at the start of the ###. After some frustrating phone calls I found out that ### had autoenrolled me for the year ### 2021, despite me not completing an application through healthcare.gov. I immediately cancelled my coverage and continued with my life. I was not informed of any further action needed from ### or Healthcare.gov.Fast forward to now and I found out I am now obligated to pay the taxes from the tax credit I was (unknowingly) given for the year ###. ###+ dollars.

If needed, could I potentially take legal action against ### or Healthcare.gov to avoid these taxes? 44225.8423611111 Hi Triston, This sounds like a very frustrating situation and I'm sorry you're going through it.  I'm an attorney and I'll try to help.   I don't think you can successfully sue Healthcare.gov because (###) federal governmental entities have immunity against most lawsuits and (###) they were not the ones that auto-enrolled you for a second year.  I think you should focus your attention on ###.  Did ### charge you any money for the ###-enrolled into?  If so, I think you best bet is to ask ### for reimbursement for that amount.  The taxes will be harder to collect from ### because, while they are a direct consequence of###'s behavior, you will have to show that you had no notice from ### about being auto-enrolled for ###0###0, and that ### knew or reasonably should have known that auto-enrolling you in ### $###.  Also, guess is that you were required to sign" an arbitration agreement when you signed up for the initial year of health care through ###.  This means that if you bring a claim against ### it won't be heard by a court but instead by an individual arbitrator hired by ### who decides the case.  That doesn't mean that you'll automatically lose but arbitration in these situations is more difficult to win than court cases.  With only $### it will not be worth hiring an attorney for this matter. So if you want to put some time into this I recommend that you write a letter to ### about the situation. Be very specific about what happened - include timelines specific information copies of notices etc. - and ask for exactly what you want.  If possible provide proof that you never received any notification that ### planned to auto-enroll you for a second year.   Write one great letter send it certified mail and then call every day to ask about the status of the letter.  Write additional letters if you need to.  Be the squeaky wheel.   The goal is to have ### write you a check before going through the arbitration process.  Feel free to respond if you have additional questions.  Good luck!

That will require you to have an attorney review the relevant documents concerning the union membership requirement and the health insurance requirement.  My best uneducated guess is that there is probably nothing wrong with these requirements.Generally speaking, the National Labor Relations Act does permit the collective bargaining agreement between an employer and a union to contain a provision requiring all employees to either join the union or pay union fees.  You would need to review the collective bargaining agreement between the employer and the union.In addition, if your union agreement mandates that you participate in the companyâ€™s group insurance, youâ€™re stuck with it and canâ€™t opt out except as provided by the union agreement.  You can contact your benefits administrator at work to see if your union contract allows you to opt out of the group health insurance plan or not.  If you can decline the health insurance coverage, you will need to find out when you can drop it or the conditions which permit you to drop it.There's no simple answer to your post.  You need to determine the particular requirements of the union agreement with the employer and the terms of the union contract.  You're obviously not required to work for this particular employer or any employer which has entered into a bargaining agreement requiring union membership (or dues or fees proportional to the union negotiated benefits and compensation). Again generally speaking, an employee cannot receive the negotiated wages, benefits etc. of an employer-union collective bargaining agreement and then pick and choose to follow other requirements of the union contract.Best wishes.44253.2861111111 So I live and work in Missouri so I am required to be a member of the work union at my job, my union is the SPFPA.

This allows an older adult to authorize someone to make all decisions regarding health care, including choosing health care providers, medical treatment, and end-of-life decisions. This power only goes into effect when the older adult is unable to make decisions for themselves.

I would say that this is a gray area under the law, as the phrase reasonable accommodation" is subject to interpretation. This is especially true in the area of ### mandates and similar requirements as issues related to COVID-###.It sounds like Eye Express was pretty firm in their refusal to allow un###ed patients to get an eye exam. I know of no easy way for you to force them. I was trying to propose a practical solution that would most easily and quickly allow you to get an eye exam namely finding a provider in your area that is willing to perform an eye exam while you are not ###ed. "44271.6298611111 Hi ###I am sorry to hear about your situation. I am sure the ### mandate must be very difficult in general if you have severe claustrophia.You present a difficult question. It is true that businesses should try to make reasonable accomodations for persons who cannot wear ###s. However, they must also consider the health and safety of their employees. I can understand why Eyemart Express might be uncomfortable having someone perform an eye exam on a patient who isn't wearing a ###.Reasonable accomodations usually consist of face ###, video or phone appointments or some other form of contactless delivery of services. None of those seem like they would work in this situation.Some medical providers who must have access to a patient's face, such as dentists, have approached this issue by having the provider wear ### ###. An opthamologist might be more likely than an ### to have ### ### and to be willing to see patients who cannot wear ###s. One solution may be to call around (or do an internet search) to find a provider who is willing to examine patients not wearing ###s.I hope this was helpful. Best of luck.44271.5555555556 I have severe claustrophobia and do not wear a ###. I live in ### City, Mo. The state doesnâ€™t have a ### mandate, but local ### have a ### mandate in place. There are exemptions to the mandate for medical reasons and also exemptions for services to the nose and face that require removal of a ### to perform the service.I had an appointment to get an eye exam for new ### and when I entered the business I was loudly addressed by three different employees, telling me I had to wear a ###. I explained my situation and they restated that I absolutely had to wear a ###. I pointed out that the local mandate allowed for medical exemptions ### they said â€œnot in hereâ€.I left and went to my car and called their corporate office. The person I spoke to apologized and said they provide face ### for those who cannot wear a ### and that I should have been offered one. They said theyâ€™d reach out to that location and have them call me to reschedule my appointment.I then received a voice mail message from the business saying theyâ€™d give me a shield to wear while Iâ€™m in the waiting room,  but that when I went back to see the doctor for the eye exam,  Iâ€™d be required to wear a ###! They suggested that if this is not acceptable to me I should look for another place that would allow me not to wear a ###. I feel this is discriminatory and they should provide reasonable accommodations.what can I do about this?44271.0125 Okthank you.44271.7631944444 You say businesses should try to make reasonable accommodations, but must consider the health and welfare of their employees. You go on to say that you can understand why Eye Express might be uncomfortable providing services to an un###ed individual, but what does the law say? Iâ€™m not sick, the provider can wear a ### (or three, should they wish to) and as you pointed out, dentists are providing care, as are other services that work up close to a persons face (aestheticians come to mind). I had my teeth cleaned a month ago and was not required to wear a ###. My understanding is that mandates are NOT laws. My understanding also is that businesses cannot legally discriminate against those with disabilities. If the mandates allow for exemptions and other providers are managing to service those with exemptions, doesnâ€™t eye express have a legal obligation to serve those who are unable to wear ###s? Wouldnâ€™t this be discrimination?44271.5958333333 So when a baby is born the state of mo requires the first stool to be tested for drugs.

I have tried contacting both the IRS to speak with the advanced law department,  and the agency that did my taxes. When calling the IRS, they told me the tax law department was closed and they weren't sure if it would open again. I was told by my tax person that they didn't know how closing the account would affect me, and what the IRS would expect as far as me paying taxes on that would go. What do I need to keep in mind if I do close this account down, and how would I go about paying the IRS the taxes on that account?44308.8638888889 When you close a HSA you have ###. Funds not contributed into an HSA could be subject to income tax. Funds used for non-medical expenses could be subject to income tax and an additional 20% penalty. You should stop any scheduled payroll contributions through your employer before requesting the closure. Funds returned via check are sent to the account owner's address on file. If that address is not current, you should update it before requesting the closure. You must liquidate all investments before your HSA can be closed. Typically the bank or broker will not automatically liquidate all investments when you close the HSA, so you have to instruct them to do so. So if you close your account and do not use the funds for qualified medical expenses you will have to report this on your income tax filing and you will be subject to taxes on those funds and possibly a 20% penalty if the funds are used for a nonmedical expense. Hopefully, this helped. Let me know if you have follow-up questions. 44312.7006944444 I live near ###, Mo. I have a disabled child that has a hand fracture that requires surgery. A covid pcr molecular test was required per the surgeon. Due to sons brain trauma we opted for a pcr molecular test that only went half an inch into nasal cavity. This was accepted by surgeon and surgery was set for this morning. I received a call last night saying the ### rejected the test and they are cancelling surgery. What can I do to get my son surgery? Can they do this legally. They only accept the covid tests they administer at the hospital even though the surgeon approved the ### pcr molecular. I really need help. My son has a brain injury from birth and will rely on his hands and labor for his livelihood and I feel this practice is going to hinder his healing and jeopardize his ability in the future.  Could someone expeditiously point me in the right direction please? Our local bar association is unavailable right now. Thank you kindly.44328.6451388889 I'm very sorry to hear about your son's struggles and hope that he gets the surgery that he needs soon.As for whether or not a physician can refuse to accept another form of the COVID test, the answer is yes. Some of the tests are far more accurate than others and the physician is well within his/her rights to refuse to accept a form of the test which the physician does not feel is sufficiently accurate. Additionally, if you provided the test results as opposed to them being sent electronically directly from the provider the physician would be within his/her rights to not accept a test from another facility on the basis that the test results could have been altered. Please understand that I'm not suggesting that you would do that, merely pointing out that a physician may have such a concern.I recognize that your son has suffered brain trauma but it is not clear to me how that relates to the standard COVID test which goes all the way up the nasal cavity. Don't get me wrong - I've gotten COVID tested three (###) times and I readily admit that it is unpleasant. My nephew is a surgeon who jokingly referred to it as getting a brain biopsy due to how far they went up his nose. While I had to agree that his description was what it felt like, I'm confident that the swab never actually disturbs any brain tissue. Consequently, I suggest that you simply get the test done at the facility to satisfy the requirement and get the surgery done. The only other option that I can think of is to see if one of the other ###s in that practice would be willing to accept the other test and get the surgery scheduled when that ### can handle it.44328.7993055556 Hi ###,Iâ€™m truly sorry that youâ€™re dealing with this situation.

Location: ###, MAOne year ago I received a dental procedure to remove four impacted wisdom teeth in a very short notice as they were affecting my ability to use my jaw, I had no other choice but to get it done immediately. I received this service from ### Dental, ### MA. I went in for an initial appointment to get looked at and sign all the necessary paperwork before the procedure the next day. This is where I was given a total cost, of what I was told was after ### had contacted the dental/health insurance I provided them with. I believed this to be a final amount cleared by my insurance of what they would cover and what portion was left for me to cover. With that said, I was given a ### of what was to be paid upfront and what would be put on a credit card account (a loan of sorts) for me to pay back on a payment plan at about 24% interest. I paid $###.### $1,781.###, which I have continued to do. Months later in September, I received an additional ### at $###. I called to ask why that would be and was told they would handle it with insurance. Months after that I received a notice again for the same ### being due to which I contacted ### again to ask what had been done. At that point, November, nothing had been done. I was told to contact my dental insurance and ask what was needed and they very plainly stated the insurance claim was not submitted correctly and that no one ever called them to verify my insurance would cover it. They suggested the claim be ### the appropriate way, by filing with Medical insurance first and then dental. Upon ### this to ### all they could say is â€œWe donâ€™t handle medical.â€ The office manager suggested I contact my medical and ask them for a denial letter. My medical stated that they could not give me a denial letter for a claim that was never filed with them. They went back and forth and on for months â€” calls to insurance companies claiming that the provider did not file the claim correctly and things could be settled if they resent it.

You didn't. I can't perform a conflicts check without that vital information. I will leave this open briefly for you to amend. 44264.8673611111 Does a power of attorney over ride a living will44270.8541666667 For the purpose of my response, I will assume that you mean a health care power of attorney (POA). But keep in mind, there are other types of ###, such as a general POA that could address both financial and health decisions.Both a living will and a durable healthcare POA allow you to choose someone you trust to make certain medical choices on your behalf. You must be at least ###. That means no one is allowed to coerce you into making a living will or healthcare power of attorney.A living will is limited to deathbed concerns only, and is used to declare your desire to not have life-prolonging measures be taken if thereâ€™s no hope of recovery, for example, in the event of brain death or terminal illness.A POA for healthcare, on the other hand, covers all health care decisions, and lasts only as long as you are incapable of making decisions for yourself. However, you can set out specific provisions in the POA telling your agent how you would like them to act regarding to deathbed issues.You can have both of these documents, but keep in mind, they shouldn't override one another and should be written so they do not. Since a living will generally covers very specific issues like â€œDNRâ€ (or â€œdo not resuscitateâ€), it may not deal with other important medical concerns you might have. For example, some people may want to refuse ### or blood transfusion, and those sorts of concerns can be directly expressed in a healthcare POA.44270.9131944444 I never said what you are saying. It all depends on what the documents say specifically and I don't have them in front of me to render an appropriate opinion.44271.0138888889 Iâ€™m not saying that you said this as an example.

Because the dental school has a legal DUTY to protect EVERYONE from Covid-19 not just you.    "44301.6881944444 Hello? This is America, land of the free. That means healthcare providers are free to accept any kind of healthcare insurance that they want. They can also require cash only. This also means that you and all other Americans are free to choose healthcare providers and healthcare insurance plans. Or you can go the cash only route too. Finally, if you have not paid for previous services rendered I advise you to pay the balance.

If so, then let them deal with this.  You don't need to send a letter of acnowledgment to the court.  Either you or an attorney on your behalf needs to file either an Answer or a Motion addressed to the Complaint within ###.  That means that you need to respond in the form of an Answer raising any defenses you have to the claims.  That would include any legal defenses as well as any factual ones.What is on your credit report is irrelevant to the lawsuit.  If you can reach an agreement with the creditor to pay some or all of the amount claimed to be due in installments then your problems are over.  However, that would require both parties to agree.  You haven't provided me with any information that indicates a defense so I'm not sure how to help you other than to tell you to follow up with Legal Services of North Florida.  Because the respose isn't due until the 20th an attorney may not file a response until that date - or even contact opposing counsel and ask for an extension so the most important thing to do is to find out whether they took your case. Good luck. 44302.0173611111 Hello, On ###st, 2021, I was served a lawsuit from North ### Medical Center. It is for an unpaid ### of $9,782.95. This was from the time I went to this hospital on ###th of ###, for intense pain around the area of my gall bladder, which was never resolved, but that's not the point. I received a ### of 30k in the beginning for the services, which I could not pay nor make any payments towards at the time, and over time it dwindled to less and less they were asking for as the ###s came by, until it hit my credit for 1.4k. In 2021, I am now in the process of paying debts off i order to clear my credit, but after I received this letter from the hospital asking for 10k, I have been too afraid to touch anything, but the way the letter is written, it sounds like I could potentially lose my vehicle, or even have my paychecks garnished. I'm needing legal advice on how to handle this, as I have contacted Legal Services of North Florida, and their response time has not been the best as i have until ###th to provide a written letter of acknowledgement to the court. I'm 23, and I've never had a situation like this happen to me before. What can I do to avoid any garnishments? I cannot pay the 10k, nor should I feel i have to since it is on my credit for only 1.4k, which is more reasonable to pay in increments. This whole ordeal has me confused as to what I should do.Thank you in advance.44301.8986111111 Are there lawyers that will take a pro bono case for malpractice of a doctor letting me go ###. Even though I called month after month and told him how horrible I was feeling and that he's wrong then giving me my transfusion which is supposed to be every ### ### ###?44303.5111111111 Good morning:  No, there probably aren't any attorneys who would take that case on a pro bono basis.  Medical malpractice cases cost the attorneys who take them thousands of dollars out of pocket for expert witnesses, at least one of which is required to offer an opinion that malpractice exists before a claim can even be made.  However, if your case is meritoriouis and has financial value, there are many attorneys who might consider taking the case on a contingency.  However, before an attorney is going to be willing to bet many hours of his/her valuable time and several thousands of dollars of advanced expenses, your case is going to have to be both winnable and valuable.  You should look for a personal injury attorney in your area for assistance.  But don't expect a pro bono attorney for this type of case.44304.5118055556 The Covid-###; however, none of them forces your pain management doctor to continue treating you--for any reason. Your doctor is relying upon the same argument that you are using: that no one can force me to get vaccinated. You are correct. And all your doctor saying is that no one can force me to continue treating them; and he has added: and I won't continue treating them UNLESS they get vaccinated. In short, BOTH of you are correct. So it is time for you to start shopping around for a new pain management doctor; or better yet: Go get a FREE vaccination. 44307.8729166667 When or if the Civic ###  by state or federal law I will then open to receiving the  vaccine. However as of yesterday ### my pain management physician has informed me that he will not provide any more treatment or care until I do receive the vaccine. Can he legally do this. Especially since there are very few physicians in this area that provide pain management medication prescriptions. His reasoning" for this is only that it would be unfair to those who did " have"get thevaccine. He refused to discuss any possible scientific evidence that differed from his own beliefs. Is this legal?Thank you ### Scheibelhut"44307.8326388889 The woman with whom I lived for ### (Northdale Rehab Center) in ###.  We never married; we just lived together.  She has the beginnings of dementia.  For years she took the same medication three times a day.  The medication is called ###.  It combines ### (7.###) with 300mg of acetaminophen.  She needs this medication to manage pain.  However, the nursing home has changed the dosage of ### that she takes.  She doesn't know what dosage she is being administered by the nursing home, and I don't know either.  The nursing home is also giving her new medications, but she doesn't know what they are, and I don't either.  Is this legal?  How much authority does the nursing home have?  How can we find out what meds she is taking if the nursing home won't tell us what they are and what the dosages are?44327.8826388889 There are two parts to your question:  Can a nursing home change a patient's medication regime? And do they have to tell you?For the first part, the answer is generally yes.  There are many reasons why someone's prescriptions or dosages might change, even if it's part of a long-standing drug regimen. For example, the patient's condition might change, they may develop additional conditions that require treatment but introduce potential drug interactions, other options may emerge that would be a better fit for the patient, etc.  As part of the admission process, long-term care facilities are required to assess patients and develop a plan of care.  Medication is an important part of both assessment and care-planning, but it's the prescribing physician (or physician extender like nurse practitioner) who specifies the dosage. That physician has to apply their own professional judgment; a different physician's previous prescription and ### can be informative, but they do not have to copy it exactly. The second ### the facility have to tell what the dosages are-- has different answers depending on who is asking.  By law, every patient in long-term care facilities has what are known as resident's rights."  One of those is the right to be adequately informed of their medical conditions and proposed treatment. (The Florida statute is at Â§400.022(1)(k)).  That includes the right to know and potentially refuse medications.  Nevertheless some patients are uncertain of their medication regime. But that does not necessarily mean the facility violated that right. Sometimes even if they've been informed the patient does not know the details or ###. That's particularly common when there may be an issue of cognitive impairment like that associated with dementia.  Despite that possibility of impairment the patient herself has the right to participate in her treatment planning unless she has been formally adjudicated as incompetent (which does not sound like the case here).But it's important to understand that it's the individual himself or herself who has that right not other parties-- even if those other parties are attempting to look out for the patient.  Because the nursing home is a medical provider they're prohibited by HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) from disclosing the patient's protected health information to outside parties.  So while you may be personally invested in the patient's well-being the nursing home can't just tell anyone who asks what her ### is. If the patient wishes she can designate someone as her "personal representative." That's not a decision to be undertaken lightly as it empowers the personal representative to make health care related decisions and exercise rights on her behalf.  In effect the rule (### 164.502(g)) authorizes someone officially designated as personal representative to be treated as the individual would.  That means the patient's personal representative can inquire about medication just as the patient herself could. If there has not been a formal designation of personal representative there are still some limited circumstances in which the facility might answer your medication and dosage questions.  I attached a fact sheet from the Department of Health and Human Services on HIPAA disclosures so you can read some more examples. But the simplest way would be if both you and the patient are present to ask the question and she communicates to the facility that she does not object to you having the information.  That request will probably be more effective if directed to a nurse (not just a nurse aide) since ### are the staff members qualified to administer medication.

Med mal is extremely complicated and time consuming.  You really need to hire an attorney.  Keep in mind that when an attorney takes on a med mal claim they don't charge an upfront fee.  They work on contingency, meaning they get paid if and when you recover money.  I would research medical malpractice attorneys in your area and meet with them.  Consultations are free.

My mother was first diagnosed in 2017. Early on the doctors should have performed a double ### when finding out that she had triple-negative breast cancer but that was never brought up to her as an option. Her first doctor, Dr. Topps, failed to consult with us about performing a double ###. Then Dr. Topps left, and she had another doctor before Dr. ###, who also left. She requested Dr. ### to examine her right breast when it began to show signs of inflammatory breast cancer, but he just ignored her pleas, brushed it off as if it were just radiation skin & tissue damage, and just reassured her that she was probably worrying over nothing. Upon finding a lump in her neck, my mother pleaded again with Dr. ### to examine it for cancer, but he brushed her off and reassured her that she was just being worrying over nothing. My mother had to have her surgeon perform the biopsies because Dr. ### refused to! The results found cancer both times. We went to the ### after getting the results, but by then my mother's chances of surviving were even smaller. My mother died during the early morning hours of ### due to complications from cancerâ€™s spread to her lungs and ### her breathing. Dr. ### should have known the signs of inflammatory breast cancer.

You didn't mention if there were any additional problems with the squamous cells so I am assuming that issue is okay - thank God.Based on your description, you don't have a claim for medical malpractice for the breast lump.

I was in the medically needy program which meant in order for Medicaid to be completely active I had to accrue $###. My hospital ### was about $1000. I submitted the ### to Medicaid and after a week they said they paid the hospital and I was able to use the insurance for the duration of that month. About six months later I started receiving calls from the hospital that the ### wasn't paid. I told them each time I had Medicaid and the lady said  ok no problem" and didn't ask for any more information. I got these calls about once a month for the next six months with the person giving me the same response. Then about a year later I started getting calls from their ###ing department that my account was still not paid. I called Medicaid and they said they never received the ### from the hospital they only received my copy of the ### I submitted to them. I asked them if they had my copy of the ### why did they not pay? They said they only pay if the provider submits the ###. On top of that since it had been over a year from the date of services they refused to allow the hospital to resubmit the ###. I told this to the ###ing department and they said I was now responsible to pay the ###. I asked them ###'t transfer me to one. After about ### they stopped calling. Now a year later I got a collections ###. I don't feel that I should have to pay because according to Fl health insurance law I had to submit all the information to Medicaid in ###' time and I did.

You are also still in the midst of a pending appeal so there's no way to determine what, if any damages you might have at this point.  However, the best way to find out what kind of case you have is to meet with an attorney who holds out as someone who specializes or focuses on attorney or legal malpractice.  Most of those attorneys offer a free initial consultation and if the case is of merit then will accept it on a contingency basis.  That will only happen, though, if you have a good case for malpractice.As you explore the possiblities further you must determine whether whatever you believe might have been malpractice actually affected the outcome of your case.  If not, then there is no actionable malpractice.  I'm not sure what your were trying to explain about your attorney entering something into evidence that included allegations of wrongdoing on your part.  However, if the judge ultimately understood that the person accused of the wrongful acts was not you then the appropriate thing to do would be to make sure those allegations do not show up in the record since if it's in the record the judge could have relied upon it in making the decision.  The standard of review on appeal for a disability hearing is support in the record as a whole."  That means that even if the judge did not rely on something that she didn't believe because you successfully convinced her there was a misidentification or some other reason that the evidence did not apply to you = then she has protected your rights by excluding that evidence from the record. Good luck.

Unfortunately, the value of the case is what will be in question.  There is no way a question and answer internet site is going to be able to de###ine enough of the surrounding facts and factors to tell you whether you have a valid claim.  What your father reported when he was admitted, whether he used the ### wife" when describing his girlfriend and many other possible issues can affect the viability of a case and are not susceptible to accurate and complete answers without the ability to gather more information - something that is not really within the scope or abilities of this website.There are a lot of restrictions on the types of cases that can be brought and how they must be brought for claims against medical personnel or facilities.  I suggest that you contact attorneys that have experience dealing with nursing homes assisted living facilities or other end of life care situations to help you de###ine whether there is a viable case and how much the case might cost you - or whether the case might be one that would be appropriate for a contingency fee.Good luck. "44356.4493055556 My name is ### Corcino. I live in ### county, Florida. No pending case yet. I want to know if I have a case or what are my options?My father was admitted to Advent Health Hospital on ###,###-19. He was then moved to ICU Diagnosed with Covid-Pneumonia. The minute I was informed that he was in ICU, I contacted the hospital to get any information possible as to his condition.  I was denied any and all information pertaining to him. No visitation or even a virtual visitation while my dad was still alert, which during this time he was alone and scared.My father's girlfriend of ###. I had requested on several occasions to be added also but I was never granted instead I was treated rudely by the nurses. I am his only daughter, his next of Kin.When he was ### I personally went to the hospital and asked questions I was told  NO we can't talk to you and NO we can't give you any info either and you can't see him not even through the glass but he is okay." It seemed so fishy to me but I did not want to upset the nurses and Doctors so they will care for my father.On ###2021  my father's girl friend called me advising me to go to the Hospital that my dad was still alive but to hurry not to ask any questions. I arrived at the Hospital and the first thing they tell me he is not going to make it. His girlfriend of ###  the doctor asked her how long they were married she said "we are not married just ###." Then the Doctor said "oh" left the room one minute later the Doctor returned with another nurse and new DNR  Forms. Then we were told that the Next Of Kin which is me must sign. The fact that I was not good enough to be there for my father from the beginning and now I have to sign him off was not right. They never allowed me to see him or to talk to him so I can  give him encouraging words to help him understand what was going on.I felt pressured confused not clear to sign. I asked questions the Doctors answers were "NO" we canâ€™t do this "NO" canâ€™t do that "NO" was already done. There was always a NO!My father passed away within the hour of me signing the DNR to which I said I did not want to sign but they pointed at the line for me to continue. I signed. I am angry ### this pain and suffering is the worst feeling.No family member should feel alone. I feel that what the nurses and doctors did by denying me any visitation or excluding me from answering any of my questions is unethical and inhumane. Help I need guidance. "44356.1770833333 As of ###, per the Order of the Governor of Florida: Florida Gov. ### DeSantis eliminated local COVID-related government restrictions requiring facial coverings in public, EXCEPT THAT ### are still required in hospitals (to protect other vulnerable sick patients who may be there, supermarkets, schools, theme parks, airports and many other places.The right to access a particular place does not trump the right of the owner of that place to set rules for entry.  Per the Governor's Order, privately run restaurants, bars and other businesses can still require ### â€” just as they can require shirts and shoes. But for the broader public's safety, to enter any medical center or hospital, ### are required by state and federal law to protect the other patients for ongoing care for medical conditions.44356.7395833333 VA Bay Pines turned me away from doing my labs, would not even allow me to enter the building without a ###. To my understanding, I don't have to wear one nor am I forced to wear one. I think and correct me if I'm wrong, it is unlawful for a federally law-governed entity whose own federal ### says maks are no longer required, to turn people away from seeking treatment. I understand that the ER has an obligation to treat and not turn away but regular appointments too? They say I'm at risk of losing my Veteran status with them because I have not been seen there in over a year (due to the pandemic" I stayed home and away from the masses of crazy idiots). Now because they think they can still turn people away for not wearing a ### (even if that person has a medical reason not to wear one or their religion says they can't cover their face) now were getting into discrimination. I just don't know what legal grounds are covered here and am looking for some advice or the steps next."44356.6756944444 I had cataract surgery last February, ###. Then, I lost my job during covid, was illegally evicted and became homeless. As a result, I couldn't pay the remaining balance of the insurance deductible. The doctor who performed the procedure, left a message on my phone saying what I did was wrong (by not paying) and that I needed to pay him. I called back and left a message saying that I lost my job, was illegally evicted and was homeless but, I would agree to a payment plan. Then, I said in the message that my right eye was going bad, the one he operated on. No reply from him. I left the same message in March. No reply. Now, my sight in my right eye is almost completely gone. Is there any recourse?I very much appreciate your answer and time.44361.6993055556 If you are suggesting that your sight is failing because of the doctor's surgery, you need to get an opinion so asserting that he committed malpractice.  You can sue him for malpractice but the burden of proof is on you to prove that he was negligent and so far, you didn't state anything so asserting. 44361.7201388889 My husband, now x husband, was on Disability ###. I became disabled approx ###, last year SSD Notified me of his overpayment and is deducting $ from my disability to satisfy the debt. 44369.6048611111 Based on what your disclosed here, no. I see no malpractice but that does not mean a claim doesn't exist. You need a large review of your medical records to see if there is negligence and I don't have that here.  Please contact an attorney who addresses medical malpractice cases for their consideration.  If they find it, they take your case on a contingency basis, meaning, you don't pay them unless and until they gain  recovery via settlement or litigation. Be aware that there is a time clock running, known as the statute of limitations and if you don't seek redress prior to the clock running out, your claim will be time barred, whether there was malpractice or not.44375.5972222222 Do I have a case for medical negligence in ### florida ?I been to er and hospitalized ### , I'm sent home in pain with antibiotics that dont work every few weeks ### ###'m back with the same problem I cant work fully for I'm having infection and pain from ### .

I have had to file numerous complaints and grievances in an effort to get services I am entitled to.  Most times, it doesn't even help.  I received a Notice of Adverse Benefit  De###ination dated ### which remains unresolved.  My case manager tried her best to convince me that the NABD does not say what it says.  Because the substance of that notice takes away nearly all the benefits that I receive, with no clear explanation as to why, I will have to file an appeal.  ###th is significant because it is the same date I received a call from Staywell's Compliance Department regarding an unrelated benefit (also unresolved).  Yesterday I told my case manager I would be filing an appeal.Most Important Issue:Today I received an email from my case manager.  First sentence, You mentioned during our conversation on ### that you have been recording our conversations."  She ended with a quote about recording without consent is punishable by up to five years in prison. My question:I feel threatened and very afraid.  How do I best protect myself against this completely false accusation that has absolutely no basis in fact?Respectfully### Kranz239-###"44384.8986111111 ###I am sorry to hear about your situation. A hospital can be liable for refusing to treat you during an emergency situation, that is, if you require immediate medical attention and if failing to treat you ### result in severe injuries or possibly death. That does not sound like your situation but correct me if I am wrong.It does not sound like the police broke any laws. Let me know if you have any further questions. 44335.8909722222 This happened to me. I went to ### Occupational Health clinic in ###. They asked me to sign a paper that was fraudulent. I refused to sign. They said if i would not sign they would not provide medical care. I felt weak and was afraid I had a concussion. I laid down on the floor in the lobby. Security was called. The police were called. I was threatened with arrest. Upon threat I left and went to another hospital for medical care.Were my rights violated? Did the hospital break any laws? Did the police break any laws?44335.6493055556 I have regularly scheduled appointments at st. Maryâ€™s hospital maternal fetal medicine because I have a high risk pregnancy situation. Today while I was there, I was told I had to wear a ### to be seen for my appointment. I refused to wear a ###. My last appointment ###, I did not wear a ### and they did not tell me to put a ### on. My question is, is the hospital staff allowed to deny me care on the basis of me refusing to wear a ### at my appointment?44341.9576388889 Yes.  Their rule requiring ###s is designed to protect other patients and staff.  What they did or did not do three weeks ago is irrelevant.  If you refuse to wear a ###, they have every right to deny your care. 44342.0083333333 There is no such form. If they wish to have you adjudicated as incompetent they must go through the probate court and have guardianship established. If you already have someone with a durable power of attorney for you then that should not happen unless they can demonstrate that the person is not acting in your best interests. Healthcare providers are always going to be more cautious and recommend that you be placed somewhere that can properly take care of you. That does not mean that such healthcare providers have any intention of taking action to force that upon you.44348.5756944444 URGENT: Where/what can I find the legal form that licensed medical professionals (i.e. doctors, nurses, physical/occupational therapists) should be or already are legally required to fill out to declare a person (me) incompetent/incapable of making decisions for myself? There are all sorts of people involved in my care" (social workers in particular) who are voicing their subjective opinions and telling me and my POA what to do where I should live etc. I am and my POA are being pressured to make changes in my living environment (independent living with support so I can remain in my home). There must be an official form for licensed medical professionals to legally declare and prove if I am competent.  I fear I will be forced to be in an institution against my will and the will of my POA. Thank you."44345.5805555556 ###Because there was no will and you are not technically the next of kin, I believe that you will have to petition the court to be appointed as the executor/personal representative. You will want to consult an attorney experienced with wills and estates to help you. They will charge you a fee but given that this is pretty straightforward, the fee shouldn't be very high.One question: Is it possible the life insurance company will be satisfied with just a death certificate, rather than actual medical records? That is normally what is requested and is easy to obtain. Let me know if you have any further questions.44348.46875 ###The release of medical records, even for a deceased person, is covered by HIPAA guidelines.Did you brother have a will that appointed an executor or administrator or is there a valid, unrevoked power of attorney for health care that specifically directs that your brother's health care records be released to a certain person after death? If so, that person would be considered the personal representative under HIPAA and would be entitled to obtain the medical records. That person would likely have to show the proper documentation, such as a will or power of attorney, to the keeper of the records, .If there is a personal representative, you could ask that person to obtain for you the copies of the medical records that you need. If your brother died without having made a will, then in Missouri the surviving spouse would be considered the personal representative and would have the priority to obtain the medical records. The surviving spouse would need to fill out an affidavit stating that he or she is the surviving spouse.  If there is no surviving spouse, the health care records may be released to one of the following persons upon affidavit of that person:Adult childParentAdult siblingCounty and state health departments and the hospital where your brother passed away can be helpful in this ### - for instance, they can let you know what documentation is required.  Let me know if you have any further ###ions.  Best of luck.44347.4965277778 ###Yes you can file the petition without an attorney if you have the correct forms. You will likely need to file in the county where your brother lived. The clerk of court in that county can assist you with the filing requirements and deadlines. You will have to attend a probate hearing but you can also do that on your own. Let me know if you have any further questions.44354.6173611111 How can I obtain my deceased brother's medical records. Hospital will not release them to me. They state that I have to be a personal representative. I need the records to release to file an insurance claim. I live in Missouri,  what options do I have.44346.2041666667 I contacted several attorneys. but their fees were too high for what I need done. I hv the required forms, can I file without an attorney since there are no assets and I am only requesting medical records. Can I submit  the forms on my own to the probate court?44354.2784722222 I took care of him and paid all the funeral cost. He has as a daughter, but they did not know each other. I don't know her whereabouts.  The hospital stated that they can only release medical records to his daughter,  who is not in the picture,  or personal representative appointed by the court since there was no will. I am next in line but do not know how to proceed.  I have a life insurance policy . They informed me that they need medical records.  I just need to know how to proceed to obtain his medical records. Thank you44347.7798611111 ###Yes it unusual for the hospital not to give you any paperwork when they discharge you after a ### ###. Did you leave without being discharged? If so, you would have a problem having a successful claim. In any event, this would have to be pursued as a medical malpractice claim. You would need to have serious injuries as a result of the hospital's negligence (if any) to have a lawyer assist you with a claim. You theoretically could pursue a medical malpractice claim in small claims court (which you can do without an attorney) but that would be very difficult as medical malpractice claims are very complicated and require the testimony of an expert. Let me know if you have any other questions.  44351.8263888889 I left the hospital after having a seizure and they didnt give me any paperwork or tell me what drugs they gave me and got into car accident.I was taken to the hospital from having a seizure and after staying for ###-###.  They did not give me any paperwork or warnings about the medications they gave me and shortly thereafter I drove to the local store to get something to eat and ended up getting into an extremely slow ### fender bender.  The cops didnt even breathalize me because it was clear i wasn't drinking.  They drove me home and after doing a bit of research I found that the hospital was giving me barbituates.Is this normal procedure for a hospital?  If they would have told me, I would have never went to the store to get food.  The doctor at the hospital, ### Regional, told me if I ever have another seizure to never come back to his hospital.Thanks - ###44350.8722222222 Dear Mr. ###,You may have misunderstood this forum.   It is a site for poor persons to post personal civil law questions.  Attorneys do not provide consultations or representation, nor answer hypothetical questions.Your post is outside the scope of this site.  You should hire an attorney for advice and guidance.  Best wishes. 44404.5666666667 I am a nurse working in a county jail. I have read the ### 221.040. I have gotten mixed information from different people. If a person is brought in by an outside arresting agency with a fit for ### discharge from a hospital but still appears to be visibly unfit. Can the receiving jail officer or nurse call the health care authority (a medical doctor) for the jail and overturn the judgment of being for for ###? I feel like they could since medical conditions can change. Also if the arresting officers or the detained person don't give the hospital complete or correct information that would mean the fit for ### would be invalid?.This is not a question being asked to help the jail or to help me. This question is me trying to clear up this information to hopefully help possible future detained people. I do not want to ask jail officials or my corporate officials as I want avoid getting biased information.Thank you for your time44371.5083333333 I suggest that you do so just to be safe. The Missouri Bar has a form that can be used for this purpose. You will also want to complete the HIPAA Authorization as well. I have attached both forms from the Missouri Bar website for your convenience.

Volunteer attorneys on this site do not provide consultations, case evaluations or actual representation.  An attorney on this civil law ### site would not have sufficient information to determine whether or not you have a viable claim regarding the prescription issue.If you believe you have a malpractice or other cause of action against the particular hospital, doctor, pharmacy or drug manufacturer, you will need to confer with an attorney who handles negligence/tort claims such as injuries sustained from medical malpractice.The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function which you may utilize to help find an attorney.

Apparently you have chosen coverage which is not accepted by many in your area.You are likely stuck with the particular ill-advised coverage you chose until the next open enrollment period.Attorneys on this forum respond to specific questions about civil law, but do not provide consultations or representation.

I had straight Medicare part A and B. In the beginning of the year ###. I was needing some dental work done and I knew part A and B did not cover dental but u could get a advantage plan that did. I decided to pay for a monthly insurance for dental separately until my advantage plan kicked in. I was considered dual eligible for my insurance because my husband had lost his job of ###. It has been nothing but problems. I can't get therapy or see a counselor because no one accepts my insurance. They have  list but when you call and talk to the doctors office I get informed no one accepts that insurance. They will accept straight Medicare part A and B. But not the dual eligible. I have filed several complaints and grievance but no one contacts me and all I get is a letter with the same list of doctors that do not accept the insurance.  This has to be illegal. Do I need to get a lawyer. The health insurance company ### Blue Cross and blue shield don't even have a department to call to follow up with this. I was just on the phone with the phone number They provided me and the women could not belive that no one accepts it and she tried calling the doctors office and could not find anyone who accepts it. I have attached to the this pictures of the letter I receive back. And that's it. Nothing more happens. Would I sue the insurance company. Can I sue them. I have more pictures to attach but it won't let me.44385.8916666667 Good morning,Medicaid income rules are complicated, but the short answer is that child support is not counted as income for Medicaid purposes, so accepting child support should have no impact on your Medicaid coverage. Missouri Medicaid follows the federal government's guidelines for income eligibility, which is called the Modified Adjust Gross Income (MAGI) rules. I'm sending you a document that confirms this, which also includes the legal citations for the applicable statute and rules in case you want to investigate further. 44418.5805555556 Hi!     Iâ€™m a ### ### (now ###) children.  Their Dad recently was released from prison, and is finally paying the child support arrears. Iâ€™m concerned that this will cause me to lose my Medicaid.  My Medicaid worker said it isnâ€™t income and sheâ€™s sure I CAN accept it.  I wanted to divide it between my children, but Iâ€™m afraid if I use it, it will cause me to lose my Medicaid and I depend on that d/t frequent medical issues (Iâ€™m disabled). Thanks so much in advance for any info/advice you can provide.Sincerely,### #########-###44390.8944444444 HI ###I am sorry to hear that you are unhappy with your doctor.

You can best do this via the internet. If there are, you should contact one or more of these firms and get their advice. If they take your case, you would pay them only if they collect on your behalf. The percentage of the recovery that you would pay can vary.You can also see if there are any law firms that would be interested in pursuing a medical malpractice claim against Dr. ###. You will want to contact a firm that specializes in medical malpractice. Again, you would only pay the law firm a percentage of your recovery if they collect on your behalf.Best of luck. Let me know if you have any other questions.44405.8256944444 Back around 2009, Dr. ### in Poplar Bluff, Missouri gave me Reclast infusions,for my osteoporosis.Due to these infusions,I am required to have surgery on ###.

He also said that I may have to have bolts and ### in my mouth, in which case, I can't use my bottom plate.I am terrified that My face will be ###, the doctor told me that there is a possibility of that happening.

I had a triple heart bypass surgery in May of 2016,and this condition with my mouth has put alot of added stress on me and I am so afraid that I will have another heart attack. I have to take ibuprophen almost every day for the pain. You are the first lawyer that I have consulted. Also, do you think I have a case?  How do you get paid, is it by percentage or how? I am needing to know because I am on a fixed income. If it is by percentage, how much is the percentage?

I am not sure how long ago this happened, but the statute of limitations for these types of claims is two years. If the lawyer takes your case, they will not charge you a fee for their services, unless you get an award, in which they would take a percentage of the award as their fee.With respect to the services that were reported to and paid by Medicare, but not actually performed or delivered, my suggestion would be to contact Medicare, let them know the details and let them handle the situation.  Let me know if you have any further questions. Best of luck.44445.7701388889 Hi ###I am sorry to hear about the problems you had with the medical center.Can you give me some more details so that I am better able to answer your questions? For instance, can you tell me how the resident assaulted you (the actions the resident took that constituted assault)? Also, can you tell me the nature of the insurance fraud committed by the hospital? With respect to the disappearance of your ring, I am not sure that there is much more you can do other than file a theft report with the hospital (other than possibly filing a police report). What was the hospital's response to your theft report? Thanks.44445.5597222222 I have had several issues with a certain hospital.  I have been assaulted by a resident and this resident also put down in my medical files that she smelled alcohol on my breath (I do not drink) and that I was a pain med seeker (I also do not do drugs.)I have complained to the patient advocate and when I was ignored there I complained all the way up the chain of command to the CEO of the hospital.  He has also ignored me. This hospital has also committed insurance fraud and I had to file a theft report against this hospital because one of their employees stole my mothers ring that I had sitting in a ### they told me to put it in. A nurse is also the person who told me to take my rings off. I really need help here. I need to know what steps I can take next to make these people listen. I am going to continue up the chain with the board of trustees then the state rep. then the state Senate then the AG if I have to. This hospital needs to be made to listen and do their jobs and protect their patients.44429.5090277778 The resident assaulted me by ramming her fingers as hard and as far as she could into my abdomen after my 3rd hernia surgery. After she assaulted me I told her how painful it was and she leaned down into face and whispered, oh you're fine" and whipped my covers back over me amd she walked out. I was in a lot of pain and because of the information she put on my file about being a drug seeker I was only given toroidal. I was crying out in pain and for help for over ###. I ended up having cdiff that the doctor never even tested me for that I contracted at the hospital. They just sent me home and did not care.The insurance fraud is when they charged me for services I never recieved.  They said I was on oxygen and I was not. They also charged me for physical and occupational therapy that I never recieved. I did a police report with the local pd about my ring. I am upset about the ring because it belonged to my mother and she passed last October.They have systematically ignored or just given me a complete run around. They say the doctor was put on some kind of trend list and would tell me nothing more. I really want to sue them but I don't know how to go about getting a lawyer to help me without paying thousands of dollars I don't have. I also believe this treatment of me by this hospital is due to my low income status and that I am on Medicare I can't even imagine how this doctor that assaulted me is treating her elderly patients who can't speak for themselves. Please help me. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time### ###"44445.6006944444 Dear Ms. ###,This forum is for posting specific civil law questions.

She had a personal gains motive as she wanted to force my parents to have to give up their parental rights over the children they'd adopted because she wanted to personally adopt ###. She knew that if she helped Children's Division with their case against my father and got him put in jail they'd have no choice but to give up their parental rights.

In order to be admitted to the nursing, she had to be approved through COMRU LEVEL ll(State) which were signed by hospital doctor, and carried to the nursing home ###.

Later, when I read that chapter I found out that the story came into my head is in that chapter; this things happened until I finish reading last chapter. Some people say, when you feel gentle breeze, it is God or ### came to you. I do not know exact answer for what happened to me. Anyway, some people say it is super power and people have super power, their pineal gland opened or looks a little different from most of people. So, I thought I need to have BRAIN SCAN TO SEE IF MY PINEAL GLAND IS DIFFERENT, OR IF MY BRAIN IS ABNORMAL. After brain scan they told me everything is normal. At that point I was very happy and told them that now I know I am having a psychi power." However hospital think I need to go to psychiatric ###. I told them I refuse go to. But they brought ###-###. After this experience I have more anxity my ### getting worse.............etc. Can hospital ship me to psychiatric ### even I did not say I have intention to harm my self or other people? I did NOT SIGN ANY DOCUMENT TO AGREE TO GO PSYCHIATRIC ### and I am NO HARM TO ANYONE AND IN FACT I WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN THEY TOLD ME MY BRAIN SCAN IS NORMAL.I want to sue hospital.(Or is it the police officer I should sue because they forced me???)Do you think I have a case?I am waiting for your respond as soon as possible.Thanks!"44463.6763888889 What I can tell you is that from your description of what occurred you have not sustained sufficient damages to support the costs of pursuing a case. But if you feel that you have a viable medical malpractice case then you should be contacting medical malpractice attorneys to evaluate it for you. Such attorneys do these on a contingent fee basis which means that you don't have to pay anything upfront. Note that these cases have extremely short timeframes to file so you should act promptly or your right to pursue the matter may be extinguished.44470.7847222222 Happy to have helped and sorry for our delayed response. Based on the statute, I believe emergency coverage would be extended to ### enrollees as well since Missouri did provide you with benefits while you were a lawfully-residing pregnant woman. ###.F.R. Â§ 433.400(d)(2). So, here's what I imagine you're outcomes are if you choose to go to the hearing. If the hearing officer agrees that you were unlawfully unenrolled, you would be entitled to either remain on Medicaid until the Public Health Emergency for COVID-###-###. Either way, I'm confident that once the emergency period is over, you will lose your coverage and need to seek out coverage on the marketplace. The worst case scenario would be that they argue you've been committing fraud by receiving Medicaid for the past year. This seems somewhat unlikely to me as long as you were honest on your application and the mistake was entirely on their end. So you have some options. If you think the Public Health Emergency will be over soon then it really doesnt seem worth having the hearing. But, if you think it's gonna last a long time and you have immediate medical needs, that's something you should take into account also. The choice is yours, but know that even if you win at the hearing, you're gonna need to find new coverage sometime soon because the Public Health Emergency isn't going to last forever.If you decide to go with the hearing, make sure you stay focused on the single issue and don't get distracted by other parts of the law. You were on Medicaid, there is a freeze on unenrollment, there are listed exceptions for when someone can be unenrolled, you were unenrolled, and you don't fall under one of the exceptions. Therefore, the unenrollment was unlawful.Best of luck!44482.9631944444 Hi Nihan,You may not like this answer because it doesn't give you additional information, but I also don't know what this one-year limit on Medicaid for ### is. I've been looking everywhere for it, but I can't find anything about a one-year limit. I tried looking through Missouri information on Medicaid as well and I still didn't see anything that would limit your Medicaid eligibility to one year. Here are my general thoughts and hopefully they'll be of some use to you. It's possible that they determined that you were not validly enrolled as of ### when the disenrollment freeze went into effect because it was more than ### qualified non-citizen" (https://www.healthcare.gov/immigrants/lawfully-present-immigrants/). If that is the reason they determined you should be ### then they could be arguing that you can be removed because you were never validly enrolled to begin with. This argument doesn't seem particularly strong to me because like you said there are only three reasons that someone can be ### during this freeze and none of those apply in this situation.Even if you had been given coverage under ### because of your pregnancy you would still be entitled to some level of medical care. "States which have elected the option under section 1903(v)(4) of the Act to provide full benefits to lawfully residing children or pregnant women must limit coverage for such beneficiaries if they no longer meet the definition of a lawfully residing child or pregnant woman under such section to services necessary for treatment of an emergency medical condition as defined in section 1903(v)(3) of the Act." (https://casetext.com/regulation/code-of-federal-regulations/title-42-public-health/chapter-iv-centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services-department-of-health-and-human-services/subchapter-c-medical-assistance-programs/part-433-state-fiscal-administration/subpart-g-temporary-fmap-increase-during-the-public-health-emergency-for-covid-19/section-433400-continued-enrollment-for-temporary-fmap-increase) If this is the section that let you receive Medicaid coverage then they would be able to limit your coverage but not completely disenroll you.I think based on the fact that you do not fall within any of the exceptions mentioned in the statute you have been unlawfully ###. To prove this at your hearing just show the hearing officer that you do not fall within any of the exceptions. I would encourage you to continue calling back and trying to find out more information about why you were ###. It will be easier to know how to prove your case if you know why you were ### in the first place. If they say the one-year rule again follow up with questions about where that rule comes from so you can look into it more. You can use some of my comments as jumping off points for questions but prior to the hearing information is your best friend. If you get more info from calling please feel free to follow up with me and ask additional questions. And hopefully it won't come to it but you do qualify for a plan on the marketplace if you run out of options or if the emergency period ends. (https://www.healthcare.gov/immigrants/coverage/).Best of luck and I hope the hearing goes well! "44482.8465277778 I entered the US in ###-###-###. I got pregnant in ###. I was eligible and received benefits through the State of Missouri. I was told my eligibility will end ###. The baby was born in December. I found out I was still eligible after ###. I had Medicaid between  ###/### ###/21. As of ### (a year after the start) I received a letter that I no longer qualify. When I called I was told being qualified and being enrolled are not the same. I no longer qualify but there is a freeze on the system so they can't disenroll me. However, my Medicaid was terminated. When I called again I was told that I was misinformed and my Medicaid was terminated because of a change in income (there hasn't been any change in my or in my household income or the savings) and citizenship status. I asked if there isn't a freeze on Medicaid disenrollment, my call was relayed to another person. By her I was told this rule is not applicable to me because I am not a citizen and I've already benefited from the Medicaid for a year which is the limit for ###. I didn't know and I still don't know what is this one-year limit is.The freeze on Medicaid disenrollment states that no one can be ### during the health emergency unless they die, commit fraud or requires the termination by themselves. The states can't change the eligibility requirements or disenroll any Medicaid benefit receivers even if they are no longer qualified or would not be qualified under normal circumstances. I am not a lawyer, not very knowledgeable about the American legal system. When I try to trace the origin of this information I reach the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and when I try to pinpoint the rule I can't because the text is too complicated for me. My understanding is that even though under normal circumstances I am not qualified for Medicaid (that could be because it is ###-year limitation which I don't know where it originates), I should stay enrolled.Some necessary information could beI've resided in Missouri since ### ###. I am a non-resident legal alienI have ###I have good standing as a studentCurrently, there is no binding rule for me stating that I can't apply or utilize the state benefitsI have insurance through my employer (university)I requested a state hearing and there is no free legal help for students. I asked for the hearing today however, I don't know when it will be. All I know I need to show something to support my claim that my Medicaid is unlawfully terminated. My question is am I ### unlawfully if so how can I prove that? 44466.9541666667 Thank you so much, I was informed I had ### but apparently, I hadn't been qualified for ### because I had primary insurance. In Missouri, lawfully residing is not entitled to Medicaid. Please let me add this is the current information there was no such information shared on the Family Division website before. So I can't tell if it has recently changed.It seems like I had Medicaid because ### doesn't cover non-pregnancy-related medical costs but mine was covered. Some persons I've spoken to said I had ### some said Medicaid. When I requested a hearing I was told If you proceed with the hearing we have to bring up that you were not supposed to be enrolled" it sounds like intimidation. In the exhibits they have my application in which I wrote that I had insurance. I informed them that it is not my problem that if my application was approved mistakenly. I am attaching one of the documents from the exhibit. It informs that ### coverage ends ### (I was told I was covered ###); the extension of benefits doesn't apply to ###. In the exhibit they say I had ### I believe proving otherwise is beyond this hearing. Even if I prove it the clauses you shared indicate that I am only eligible for emergency Medicaid (I wonder if those clauses about emergency apply to ### as well as it was under the Medicaid clause). The exclusion of lawfully residing persons was ### during the period the legislation was open to comments. This is also what I think it is discrimination it is against the essence of the Families First Act. However again it is beyond the state fair hearing. The hearing officer will follow the rules presented in the document I am attaching. At this point it doesn't seem logical to proceed with the hearing. I dug deep while waiting for an answer not knowing if I would receive one. I am not knowledgeable about the American system so it took me days to find the related legislation. I am not trying to say you were late I just didn't know if I'd receive one I didn't just want to sit and wait. I sincerely appreciate for ### time to answer my question. It is ### to know someone cares.Regards"44482.9104166667 ###,Iâ€™ll look into this and circle back with you.All best,### ######-###44469.1159722222 $1640.50.

I have compiled proof of the errors.Because healthcare providers are sharing records through the ### portal, my records are incomplete and inaccurate with multiple organizations, and it has harmed me physically and financiallyâ€”causing continuous SSD denials since 2016. Specialists cannot offer proper medical treatment based on inaccurate information, and, in one particular instance, my life could be endangered.I have missed out on proper medical treatments too, resulting in further injury. For instance, my cervical lordosis wasnâ€™t properly addressed in ###, and my neck conditions have worsened, causing pinched nerves, resulting in sensory ###. I have not been given pain medication from the ###â€™ve visited, nor has any other physician prescribed themâ€”aside from Percocet and ### from PCP which didnâ€™t help at allâ€”despite my lack of relief from numerous spine and neck injections from three of the clinics. If theyâ€™d seen accurate and complete records, perhaps they would have prescribed something effective for the severe pain I am in every second of every day instead of treating me like a drug addict looking for a â€œfix.â€I submitted amendment requests of PHI to both organizations this past summer and both have violated HIPPA ### 164.526. I reported the violations to the ### on ###, but nothing has happened yet. violations:BJC:didn't provide a rationale for the doctorâ€™s disagreement to amend. My amendment request listed multiple issues yet nothing was addressed in detail.didn't provide information regarding my right to submit a written statement disagreeing with the stated Amendment denial until I told them about it. didn't provide a statement regarding my right to ask for the amendment request and the denial to be included with any future disclosures and didnâ€™t provide a description of how I could file a complaint following my receipt of BJCâ€™s denial to Amend. Also, I'm part of the ### BJC data breach of PHI. Mercy:didnâ€™t provide the full amount of mandated information. missed the ### deadline to respond by ###. didn't provide information regarding my right to disagree with the denial and have it included in my record. The HIM supervisor is ignoring all messages I've sent regarding these things too.The stress of this began last January when I began noticing errors and is seriously harming my health.44488.7979166667 August,Thanks for posting your question.  What a frustrating and scary situation.  I don't have a medical background, but it sounds promising that your son is now awake!!!  I'll try my best to give you some suggestions, but it sounds like you really need to retain an attorney who specializes in health care law to advocate for you and even file a legal action to compel treatment of your son.  A couple of suggestions for you, some of which you may have already tried:###.  The hospital usually have some type of patient advocate office and/or review board that you can go to if you have any disagreement with the course of treatment.  You may want to try that.###.   Have you considered switching doctors in the hospital and getting a second opinion.###.   You have the option of switching hospitals if you're not happy with BJC.  Locally, you can look at Mercy in Creve ###, or look out of state.  If he will receive a transplant at UT, you may want to look at having him transferred there.  Obviously, discuss this in advance before you do that in order to ensure that they will comply with your preferred course of action. ###.    Even if you don't switch hospitals, you may want to discuss this with UT and see if they can provide assistance or intervene.5.    Do you have a Medical Power of Attorney over your son?  If so, you should be able to call the shots on his medical treatment if he's unable to make those decisions on his own.  If you do not have a Medical POA, and your son is awake and alert enough to understand and sign one, I'd strongly suggest that you have him sign one appointing you as his Agent for heatlh care.  I wouldn't just have him sign the form one that the hospital gives you, but it may need to be customized by an attorney.  The form Missouri Bar form can be found here: https://missourilawyershelp.org/legal-topics/durable-power-of-attorney-for-health/6.  Have you tried having a detailed discussion with the doctor you disagree with?  Sometimes you can persuade them to change their mind.  If not, you may want to have the transplant team at UT discuss this with him.The best course of action is my opinion, particularly as time may be of the essence, is to retain an attorney who focuses on health care law to assist you, give you advice on your rights, and even possibly file an action against the hospital to compel the treatment you're seeking.  If you cannot afford an attorney, please see the following list of pro bono agencies where you might be able to obtain a pro bono attorney:https://missourilawyershelp.org/discounted-pro-bono-services/https://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=######9###8Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, ###/ , used to have an attorney who handled health care matters, so you may want to try them.  Also, Catholic Legal Assistance Ministry, is located at St. ### University's law school, and that school has a special program for health care law.  You can reach CLAM at: http://www.ccstl.org/organizations/st-francis-community-services/  If you call Legal Services or CLAM and they're unable to help you, please ask them who they'd suggest you contact.  They would, at least, have additional resources and place to suggest to you.I hope this helps a little bit.  Know that you, your son and your family will be in my prayers.  Please don't hesitate to reply to this message if you have any further questions.  Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck with this matter.###44497.5722222222 My 39yo son, Jarod,  is being treated for Covid-19/ARDS at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. He is in the ICU on life-support/ECMO. We are currently seeking a lung transplant program and have some very excellent prospects.  In the meantime the medical team had been unable to wake my son and wean him from sedatives which was a requirement for the transplant program at UT Southwestern. We are also in communication with ### and Northwestern but they have not made any solid commitment yet.Last week it was recommended by a nurse and NP that the ECMO Oxygenator be replaced; however, at a meeting in the beginning of the week the attending physician asserted that he did not need replacement.  We pushed for replacement and on Thursday it was replaced.  Jarod's vitals and numbers" experienced an immediate and dramatic improvement.Last Friday Jarod's family met with the medical team and we were told that since he has made no progress and has no prospects for a lung transplant they will be withholding care other than "comfort care" and were suggesting that we authorize "pulling the plug" to facilitate a peaceful death.Over the following weekend the medical team was able to dramatically reduce sedatives and Jarod began to wake without the previous experience of "crashing" vitals and "numbers". Currently he continues to be awake and sedatives have now been reduced to minimal. We see this as significant progress and a step toward the criteria of being awake that UT Southwestern requires.  However the attending physician still refuses to retract the withdrawal of care directive and if the ECMO machine experiences a breakdown (e.g. needing another oxygenator) or any other event occurs they will not take any ### need help in compelling the hospital to continue care until all avenues to getting Jarod a lung transplant have been exhausted which they clearly have not been.

After I received the ###, I just started to order from ### ### ### ### ###'t wear them anymore. I went to another ### in Cape Girardeau, MO when this occurred in ###. I ordered and wore eye ### from that point on. In ###. He also said I should sue ###. Do I have a case?44511.7798611111 The problem is that there is a very strict two (###) year statute of limitations (SOL) for medical malpractice cases. Since you stopped getting contacts from them in ###017, I suspect that you are precluded from pursuing the case by the SOL. Pursuing a case under the normal tort five (5) year SOL may be possible, but I suspect the medical malpractice SOL will apply.I strongly encourage you to contact a medical malpractice attorney as soon as possible to get an opinion on this issue. Do not delay, as you are now approaching the five (5) year SOL as well.44511.8368055556 My daughter (###) is currently in a mental health facility in Missouri. We are residents of ###. She has been there for ###. We are being told in order for her to be able to come home for Christmas, for ###, we will have to be vaccinated. This includes my daughter, myself, my husband and ###. Can they not allow her to come home if we refuse to be vaccinated? (I did have the 1st dose of the vaccine this year, but became very ill following it, so I have decided not to allow my family get the vaccine)44530.9104166667 The facility cannot force you or anyone in your family to get vaccinated. However, the facility is well within its rights to protect itself and its residents and staff against the spread of a highly contagious, and sometimes deadly, virus. I do not know the nature of your daughter's mental health issues, nor the nature of her participation in treatment at the facility. Depending upon those things, the facility is free to either refuse to release her home for Christmas or to refuse to let her return afterward if your family does not comply with the vaccination requirement.By the way, getting very ill" following the vaccination is merely the body's reaction to building up the necessary antibodies to fight off the infection should it be exposed to it later. In other words that wouldn't necessarily mean anything was wrong. My wife and I both contracted COVID just over a year ago and were miserable for ###-###. Once the vaccine was available my wife got the ### & ### shot and ended up feeling miserable again for a day or two. To be clear I interpreted your statement that you got "very ill" to mean nothing more than what was reported by some getting the vaccination - basically feeling like garbage for a few days and drained of energy. If by "very ill" you mean that you suffered a serious and long-term health issue that is an entirely different matter. Please don't think that I am indifferent to your health issues. My wife and I have a child with fairly significant mental health issues. I know it can be tough not just for the child but for everyone in the family. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. Best wishes."44530.9569444444 Have you tried talking to a licensed Medicare agent?  They are very helpful.  The Medicare Helpline number is ###-###.  See if they can answer your questions.  If you have further questions after speaking to an agent, I'll keep your question open for a few days.44533.8284722222 I have been on disability for ### ### & was eligible for Medicare but had my ins that I had retired with from employer. With that falling in middle of year, I had already paid my max out of pocket and didnâ€™t want to start Medicare premiums until January. Bcbs of Illinois is denying part of my claims saying Medicare should be my primary. I only took Medicare part A since it was free.

My wife isnâ€™t in the military at all and I donâ€™t believe they have any right to my wifeâ€™s health in this matter and they then proceeded to call me a liar and telling me to go make my wife get another one if thatâ€™s the case? I truly donâ€™t think it is legal it feels like a hippa violation because we also didnâ€™t give the clinic the right to give her information out to the military again she isnâ€™t and has never been in The United States Military. Thank you for your time. Please get back to me at the earliest 44538.9215277778 So is the hospital Desk worker even allowed to say she was there or not? Also informed them on other dates she visited in the past. And I gave them the information so thatâ€™s them not believing â€œmy unit has been involved in other bad thingsâ€ but thatâ€™s besides the point 44538.9875 The hospital also lost the records apparently 44538.9326388889 The hospital personnel canâ€™t acknowledge your wife was there without risking a HIPAA violation. 44538.9909722222 You are misunderstanding the nature of HIPAA. There is nothing illegal with asking because HIPAA doesn't apply to anyone else - just healthcare providers. The healthcare provider isn't permitted to release such information, or even acknowledge that your wife was a patient, without your wife's authorization. They likely thought you were a liar because the clinic refused to admit that she had been seen. Your unit, however, is entitled to receive some form of confirmation that your wife is COVID-### - particularly at this time of year when many folks might try to get out of their obligation. I'm not at all surprised that you were instructed to provide some meaningful form of confirmation before they release you from drills.44538.9618055556 ###,You likely only have a case if you test positive for COVID with ongoing serious symptoms - so hopefully you do not have a case. Even if what they did was nasty, negligent, and reckless, the case hinges on both liability and damages. I am sorry that you had to go through this. Keep me updated but hopefully you do not need me. Always happy to answer your questions or to point you in the right direction going forward.All best,### ######-###44543.9236111111 On Saturday ### I was driving for ###. I received a pickup request from ### County Regional Hospital.  I arrived to pickup my customer.  Nursing staff escorted out a patient in a wheelchair.

It was from ### Mo to ### Springs Mo. (About a ###) During the trip my passenger told me that she was just tested by the hospital that day for covid and the test was positive.  I completed the trip and retuned to the hospital.  I asked to speak to the charge nurse. The charge nurse stated that the ride was set up through the patient coordinator from the hospital.  Under ### community guidelines if you have covid or symptoms of covid you are not to use the service.  The hospital lied when setting up transportation.  They knowingly and intentionally exposed me to covid.  I could have unknowingly exposed several other people to covid that night if the patient had not told me that they had a positive test result. "44543.9145833333 Dear Mr. Black,If your contract actually guarantees you your money back if the treatments do not succeed, you would have a potential claim for a breach of contract based on the warranty provided.

I asked they check for a immunodeficiency  cause there was things they could do to help him fight covid. They refused and said it would be inaccurate.  I talked to my immunologist she said that is wrong and with his history he could have a immunodeficiency and things can be done to help him. The doctor has refused to allow us a consultation and my dad ended up on a ventilator and has lung damage and may not make it. Had they tested him and began treating him correctly from day one and tested him for immunodeficiency instead of ignoring our request then they could have prevented him from getting to this point they could have been giving him iGG replacement therapy to help him fight and monoclonal antibodies. They said he would not qualify for the antibodies because he was in the hospital but he was not there for covid. He could have gotten this the day he tested positive before he got bad and it could have helped tremendously again we were denied. When you have a immunodeficiency and don't fight these antibodies help prevent the virus from getting worse. I got covid and got these and I was better within ###. They could have helped and did not. They refuse to listen to us and because this he got worse and may not make it. Just because my dad was hospitalized for something else and got covid this should not have knocked him out of getting the antibody infusion and he could have gotten better. Doctors that are not doing what is necessary not doing what needs to early to help is not right. Because this is a pandemic they are getting away with everything. In some cases they are overlooking and not doing everything possible even the stuff approved such as monoclonal antibody infusion which is provided for people at high risk and not hospitalized. Had my dad been home he would have gotten the monoclonal antibody infusion but because he caught it in the hospital when he was there for something else it knocked him out. These issues need to be addressed.  My dad having multiple infections over the year they should have looked into why. They ignored these opportunities and this is wrong covid or not. They should have done there job.44568.6833333333 You never asked a legal question that I could see.

However, I dont want to discourage you if you want to pursue a claim. There are two possible defendants from the facts you submitted. You may have a claim against the doctor who perscribed the medication. Second, you may have a claim against the manufacturer of the medicine. To evaluate a possible claim, you need to talk with an attorney who specializes in medical malpractice and/or products liability cases. If you don't know an attorney, I suggest you call the Texas Bar Association Legal Hotline at 800-### or Lawyer Referral at 800-###. Explain your situation and ask for a lawyer referral. These lawyers will often take cases on a contigency fee basis which means they will not charge you a fee unless they win the claim for you. So, don't be afraid to talk to a lawyer if you don't think you can afford to pay a fee. But, be sure you understand who would be responsible to pay any fee and the costs to pursue a claim. There are time limitations to filing these claims, so don't wait to get started. You might also contact the consumer complaints area of the Texas Attorney General's office to see if there is something they could do for you. Their number is 800-###. One final suggestion would be to google" the doctor and the medication to see if there is any information about complaints or lawsuits against the doctor or the maker of the medication.

She books and schedules unnecessary procedures then the bills are forwarded to me.

Can he do that?"43213.8208333333 Dear ### -- Thank you for posting. If your son is unable to respond on his own, one option is to become her guardian so that you can handle his legal issues for him. Attached is a guide to becoming a legal guardian in Texas. You may want to consider contacting an attorney that specilizes in guardianship to help you with this process.Other documents that you may want to consider include:Durable power of attorney. A power of attorney gives you the authority to make financial decisions for someone else, such as signing checks to pay bills, handling tax returns, and selling a home. Unlike a general power of attorney, a durable power remains in place if the person for whom you are making decisions becomes incapacitated and canâ€™t make decisions for himself or herself. A regular power of attorney ends if the person who issued the power of attorney becomes incapacitated.Health care proxy. This is essentially a power of attorney for medical decisions. It allows you to make choices about treatments, doctors, and other health-related matters.Living will. Also known as an advance directive for health care, a living will lets your loved one specify the medical treatment that he or she wantsâ€”or doesnâ€™t wantâ€”near the end of life.43258.6104166667 I have a ###, anxiety disorder and Mental depression.

I am a below the knee amputee and utilize a knee ### when going to the pool as this is the only way I can safely move about the pool deck.  My prosthetic is ### and expensive and I canâ€™t risk damage by wearing in the pool. It is also incredibly difficult to walk in when wet. I have to go down a difficult, grass/muddy at times, slope to avoid stairs and come awkwardly back up the steps on return.

First, congratulations on your good performance review and that your 2nd level superior recommended that you put in for a promotion. Thatâ€™s awesome.Youâ€™ve got two potential avenues of protection here. First is under FMLA. Second is under the Americanâ€™s with Disabilities Act, also known as the ### What you are requesting is a work accommodation for a medical condition, which may fall under the ###. Your doctor would need to fill out paperwork for either (or both) stating your condition, how it impacts you, and what your employer needs to do to assist (this is known as the â€œreasonable accommodationâ€). It sounds like your employer is being supportive of your needs, which is great, but your concern seems to be about your coworkers and having to explain yourself at work. No one can force you to disclose your condition other than to receive accommodations, and that is a confidential process.  If your co-workers persist in asking about your condition that may arise to harassment. Your employer canâ€™t punish you for requesting accommodations.I would recommend talking to your HR department. As a large employer, there is probably an accommodations team who specializes in these requests. And they are required to keep all information confidential.   Best,###43290.8534722222 I've worked full-time as an administrative coordinator for a fortune ###. Three friends recommended a sleep doctor to me, because I'm often so exhausted that I sleep in my car for ###.  The sleep doctor's treatment plans seem to be making things worse and now he wants me to stop one of the stimulants that another doctor prescribed. I want to stop the stimulant too but I am scared this will make me even more constantly tired and that I might need to request an accomodation so I can work flex hours (ie if I sleep in my car for an hour, that I can work late an additional hour to ensure I get in my full ###'m alert while working). I'm already ### enough about my behaviors. This sleep doctor has additional ideas that I hope will work but if they don't, what can I do to protect myself? I'm scared of painting a target on my back by requesting FMLA, but I'm also scared of what might happen if I don't get FMLA.I ### told my manager that I am seeing a doctor for a health issue and might leave work a lot for that reason, but of course I will make up any time out by working late. My boss' boss told me to apply for a promotion and I had a good performance review so I don't think I'm in trouble, but I'm told another administrative coordinator made a rude comment about my long lunch breaks so I'm scared. I'm told people notice when I am gone and wonder about it but I'm so scared to talk aobut doctor stuff at work. 43254.15625 My daughter is ###. She wasnâ€™t in any sort of crisis situation, she was just having complications from her medications, so due to the recommendations from an outside dr they advised to go back to the inpatient facility to inpatient to have them address her medications. We did that and let them know from the minute that we got there that she was voluntarily checking herself in for medication management only and there was no crisis situation. From the day she checked herself back in they have not been giving her the care or addressing her needs. She requested to leave and submitted a letter in writing and signed it and dated it on Thursday and gave it to the therapist. She has also verbally told the nurses, dr, and patient advocate of her request and they are not letting her leave. They are violating the patient ### of rights and threatening her that if she pursues her requests and tries to sign an AMA, she could face court. We donâ€™t know what to do at this point. If she gave them the letter on Thursday, they didnâ€™t do an official exam or a Court order to have her stay. Itâ€™s been well over the ###. They keep trying to deter her every time she mentions it to a staff member. They just ignore her and tell her that she canâ€™t go home yet. I donâ€™t want to take the chance that they can do a court order to try and keep her. This whole thing is a nightmare and we need to get her out. Please help. 43255.1472222222 Hi ###,Thank you for contacting Free Legal Answers, I know that this situation is very stressful for you and I hope I can make it a bit easier for you. Iâ€™m sorry that youâ€™re going through this. Divorce is stressful enough without having to worry about insurance during the process. Generally, health insurance changes can only be made for what is called a qualifying life event (marriage and divorce would both qualify but the divorce generally has to finalized) and during open enrollment (the time when you can make changes for the next year). Is he threatening to remove you during open enrollment for the next plan year? Do you still have insurance? During the divorce process things like insurance are decided and a judge, or through mediation depending on how your case goes, may be able to require him to keep you on his insurance for a certain amount of time. In extreme cases, a temporary protection order (TRO, also known as an injunction) can be filed to stop someone from taking an action that would hurt someone else and that may be an option for you. You didn't mention if you've gotten a lawyer for the divorce, I've included the link to the San ### Community Justice Program who may be able to provide you a referal to lawyer if you need or want one. Best,###San ### Community Justice Program 43290.8618055556 I am separated from my husband but still live in our first home we both invested in and will have it paid off by the end of this year. He left me when his work took him out of town and he met another woman. He was living with her and coming home off and on. We tried to get back together in March of this year because she was leaving their relationship. We were going to attempt to save our 26-year marriage. I took him back and were doing things like husband and wife again, but it only lasted a week because she called and he went back to her. Our children are grown so we only have a house that will be paid off soon. I am a diabetic and on medication. Iâ€™m concerned because even though we are not divorced, he is removing me from his insurance. I am a school teacher by trade but have not had a stable for job about a year.  However, I am substitute teaching until end of this week. The separation affected the well-being of my emotional and mental health. I am currently getting medical attention for my diabetes but he wants to drop me from his insurance. I am planning to go back to work and obtaining my own insurance eventually.

It sounds like she is very ill. I have a few questions to see the best way to help you. Do you know if prior to her getting sick she had signed a form called a medical power of attorney?  If you have it, please upload it. Do you know how she is currently doing? You mentioned that she had been in a coma, has she gotten better? Does she know where she is, who she is, that kind of thing? Thank you, 43277.8645833333 I'm glad to hear that she's doing better and on the road to recovery. It sounds like she is still receiving some medical care that is either being paid for by her parents or that she is still covered on their health insurance plan. As they don't seem to approve of her relationship with you they are using this assistance essentially as a way to keep you apart. The good news is legally they can't force her to stay with them; however they can remove their financial support if she leaves. If she's covered by their health insurance their may be a specific time frame for that change, this is called open enrollment. Changes can also be made for a life changing event" like if she got her own insurance. If her parents are truly holding her against her will or you are concerned about her health and wellness I would recommend calling the local police station for a wellness check. Her parents can't force her to stay if she's over ### but they aren't obligated to provide any support either. I know this likely isn't the answer that you want but unfortunately there is not a way to both force her parents to allow you to see her and make them continue to pay her medical bills.

I'd recommend having her discuss the issue with legal aid: https://internet.lanwt.org/home or a personal injury/medical malpractice attorney in your area. She would be the client so she would need to speak to them. Her parents can't keep her at their house against her will. She can leave with you if she chooses to. Keep on mind that they wouldn't be able to make you responsible for the medical bills, your girlfriend would be responsible as  they are her bills bu her parents can't force you to pay.Good luck. 43278.0090277778 Thanks for all your help and I really appreciate your advices43278.0743055556 Thanks for your response and she didnâ€™t sign nothing because mentally she wasnâ€™t capable of and yeah she got out of coma and now shes doing better but now shes isolated from everything living with her parents kinda against her will she has told me she wants to come back but her parents wont let her because insurance her medication and stuff like that and her mom told me if i got close to her she would put a restraining order on me I would really appreciate your help or advice43277.8833333333 That would be a criminal law question that is outside of my area of practice.

In Texas, eligibility of a child being raised by a grandparent, aunt, or uncle, for Medicaid can be determined on the basis of the income and resources of the child alone. Thus, most children raised by a relative caregiver can qualify for Medicaid, because the income and resources of the adult do not count in the determination of eligibility.Attached, please find the Kincare Primer. It is a manual designed to assist and provide resources/information to relative cargeivers and kincare households. You can also have your father contact the Texas Kincare Taskforce to speak with an attorney re: this issue. ###Hope this information helps.Best,43264.6798611111 Hello, I am getting conflicting answers from employees of the state" and did not find any conclusive answers researching online either but I have a question about my childrens' eligibility for Medicaid.Background info: my ### ages ### 5 were both taken by CPS but never went outside the family ultimately ending with my parents being "managing conservators" (the girls live with my parents though I do not). During the CPS case the kids were covered by Medicaid; when the case closed my dad put them on his employer's insurance. He is now about to retire in less than two weeks and will lose his insurance coverage (and the kids') - The plan had always been to get them back on Medicaid. The local HHSC office told me that since the grandparents are raising the children and only benefits for the children are being asked for that my parents' income would NOT count against them for Medicaid eligibility. But I'm confused because a lady on the ###-### (that they would not be eligible b/c my parents "make too much money" (even though my dad's income will obviously be decreasing extremely after he retires.So can you please tell me if there is a black and white rule regarding this issue?

The first was because my son was arrested but had my address on his ID. I did not consent to him using my address. I can't check my mailbox. I have a caretaker that does. The second one was because maintenance said I refused to open my door for an inspection. This is not the case. It just takes me about 3-5minutes to make it to the door from my room.

There were several tests, appointments, a seminar, physical therapy, and a sleep study as part of the treatment. After several months he gave me the all clear" on my last visit and told me cognitive impairment was normal for my age (60). My insomnia worsened and existing conditions were exacerbated and new conditions developed like high blood pressure ### others. All this culminated with a ### or a transient systemic attack (often a precursor to a serious stroke) last September. It was emotionally painful watching my health deteriorate as I had always been ### about my health and went through great lengths to remain vibrant and healthy.Being at the end of my rope without any answers as to why this was the case I requested my records from this doctor in ###19 shortly after the stroke. I found out he had reported ### with the sleep study such as "severe Periodic ### Movement Disorder" and "elevated ###" (### distress index) and that I may require "a positive ### pressure (PAP) titration study to determine therapeutic pressure" for a nasal ###; "that patient should sleep in a non-supine position"; and that the "current plan" would be for "patient to complete a polisomnography studyâ€.

This can cause many serious health issues. So he scheduled another sleep study for ###20. The sleep study verified there was a sleep problemâ€” and the finding was oxygen deprivation which was causing undo strain on my heart and which should have been treated in ###.

There are several things on the death certificate that need to be corrected. Her name is spelled wrong, her marital status is incorrect, and the 3rd cause of death concerns me greatly because it is not only wrong but impossible. When I tried to contact the certifying practitioner, on the first call I was told that she was busy with patients but would call me back. When she did not return my call, I made several more attempts to contact the person, now I'm being told I can't talk to her because of HIPAA laws. They said they are not allowed to disclose any information. I wouldn't think HIPPA laws pertain to someone who is deceased or would be a violation of privacy since I am next of kin. That just doesn't sound right, because the certificate itself states that corrections can only be changed by the certifying physician and that's what I'm trying to do to get it corrected. What do I need to do to get the death certificate corrected?It sounds fishy to me. Maybe they are covering up or changing records because it's a wrongful death, and ### ###, and there were only ###.

No, the man can submit to testing in NC at a desgnated lab that works with the DNA testing center ordered by the court. You can petition to establish paternity in MD courts. Once that is established, you can ask the court to have the birth certificate amended to list the father and file an order for support. The good thing with the military is that the soliders are pretty easy to track down. If he is uncooperative, you may have to get in touch with his commanding officers, but that is a last resort.

Unfortunately, this forum was not designed to assist with legal representation for alleged medical malpractice.  I would suggest that you contact a private Medical Malpractice Attorney to review your case.  If the Attorney feels that your case has merit, they will likely take the case with no of of pocket cost to you.  This type of representation is called a  Contingency agreement.  If suit is filed on your behalf, and the case is decided in your favor the Attorney will receive a percentage of the award, which you will have agreed to when you engaged the Attorney.I wish you good luck with your health issues, and I am hopeful that you are able to reach a resolution to your claims that satisfies you.Kid regards,### J. ###Attorney at Law43637.725 Dear Ms. ###,I'm sorry to hear about your problems with your implant.  The University of Maryland Dental School is one of the top Dental Schools in the U.S., which would suggest that you received the proper care.  After reading your question, I consulted with a Dentist who specializes in implants, to get his opinion.  The following is what he responded with:There are many possible reasons for an implant crown feeling loose the most common is a loose screw.  They should have their dentist do an evaluation to make a diagnosis most cases all it takes is replacing the screw which is very quick.  The longer a crown is left loose the higher the risk of metal fatigue fracturing the screw or much worse the implant platform itself.  ### will not cause an implant crown to become loose but once it is loose it will often be discovered by ###.A little info about screw vs cement retained crowns on implants:  There are three components of an implant restoration: the implant ### (below the gum) an ### (intermediate piece that ### into implant) and the crown (cement or screw retained).   Even if a crown is cement retained there is still always a screw present as part of the system.  a screw retained crown is actually just the crown/### cemented together outside the mouth with a screw access hole in the crown to allow easy retrieval for repair or replacement of the crown.  Screw retained restoration are by far the most preferable because a very common cause of implant failure is the overflow of cement from crowns cemented in the mouth (it is very difficult to ensure all cement is removed).  In recent years the recommendation has become to do screw retained crowns whenever possible to reduce the risk of cement sepsis related implant failure.  In summary a cement retained crown would likely have made no difference in this case it would only have made it more difficult to access the screw to evaluate the cause of the crown ###."After reading the above response I would suggest that you contact the Dental School and ask for an appointment so that your implant can be examined and repaired.  I would be surprised if there were a charge for this so I don't believe that you need to be adversarial at this point.Cordially Yours### J. ###Attorney at Law"43819.7541666667 I had my tooth implant done about ###.

Best to you and yours as well!Kind regards, ###43819.8527777778 I was diagnosed January of ###, with Multiple Myeloma at age 55. Because of my young age a autologous (self) Bone Marrow Transplant is the option that would allow me to live a longer and healthier life. Because I am one of  Jehovah's Witnesses I require a Bloodless procedure at either, ### Medical's Bloodless Transplant program or Georgetown Universities Bloodless Transplant center. But I was turned down by both Hospitals because they will not take the amount offered by Maryland Physicians Care (Medicaid). They would not even consider negotiations. And sent me away to die, quite ###.Although I have come to terms with the situation, because the preparation ( ### of paperwork) have consumed so much of my time with no positive result. I want to make sure that both Hospitals and my insurance company are acting in accordance with the law. And not just sending me away because I don't understand my legal and religious right. Because it would be financially in the best interest of all parties if I did not get the bone marrow and died sooner. There by limiting the the cost of my health care. 43857.3958333333 From your description it sounds like your son has applied for, and been denied, participation in the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) Program, which covers the cost Medicare premiums and co-pays for recipients. Are there any other possible sources that the State may be counting as income (tips, self-employment income, unemployment benefits)?  Medicare sets the income limit for the QMB program every year and for ### $### ### (see: ### and https://mmcp.health.maryland.gov/Documents/Medicaid%###0Income%###0Limits/###0###0%###0MONTHLY_INCOME_AND_ASSET_GUIDELINES_4%###0on%###01.###7.###0###0%###0(1).pdf) which is a higher limit that the income amount you stated.  The other thing that determines financial eligibility are your son's assets.  The asset limit is $11,###, bank accounts, stocks, and bonds.  For more information on what does or doesn't count as an asset, please take a look at the medicare.gov link above.  Even if your son is under the monthly income limit, if he is over the asset limit, that will affect his eligibility.  As you identified, spend down may be an option to help him get under the income and asset limit to qualify for QMB, but if he has too much in the way of assets he may benefit from opening an ABLE savings account which allows people with disabilities to save for disability related expenses without jeopardizing their access to benefits like Medicaid, SSI and SNAP.  The ABLE National Resource Center has some useful information specific to how the account works with Medicare savings programs like QMB: https://www.ablenrc.org/wp-content/uploads/###019/07/###-Maximizing-Use-of-ABLE-w-o-Jeopardizing-Other-Benefits.pdf.  Maryland has an ABLE program: https://www.marylandable.org but many other states also allow out of state residents to enroll in their programs, so your son can shop for the program that is best for him.Your son can appeal the decision if he is within the ### appeal period, or apply again if he missed the appeal window.  If he decides to appeal I would be happy to provide information on some organizations that may be able to assist him through the appeal process.44005.85625 My son lives in Dundalk, MD with this spouse, ###. Their only income is $### disability benefits. Their rent is $### $###. When the last response came, allowing a pay down option, utilities were not included in the calculation.  ### has applied for and has been twice denied the type of medical assistance that would pay his medicare premium and co-pays. Because of physical and mental health problems, he needs a great deal of medical care. Their net income is about ###. What can ### do to get medical assistance?
