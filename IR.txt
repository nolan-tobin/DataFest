Property mgmt. and owners say they had lawyers look their leases over and there is nothing illegal about it (### vs ### kinda)My Question:  Is my lease curfew requiring children under the age of ###?43635.9826388889 Mr. ###:Thank you for your question; you are not alone in asking lawyers about exactly where the parameters of this privacy issue lay, and on the whole, I think you got it just right.  Yes, people can take photos of persons, conduct or things that are readily in plain view so like you said, the apartment fronts are fair game in terms of ### taking photos.  (I am not saying that this is not highly ### ### it is legal based on this description.)It is when a person ###, ### or causes items to be ### into private spaces that civil and/or criminal liability can arise.  The civil claim is called intrusion upon ### and generally includes the following elements: (###) intrusion of a person or thing into a private space, (###) where the plaintiff has a subjective and reasonable expectation of privacy, (###) in a manner highly offensive to normal standards of the community.  It does not sound like any of this happened, at least in a legal sense, regarding the ### neighbors taking photos of your apartment front or your son.  But if they took it a step further and ### or observed your family in your private space, that would be an entirely different story.If this is an apartment complex that is not owned or managed by a housing authority or government agency, it is entirely private, so the ### would not be considered public property; the landlord is the private owner.  However, authorized ###, tenants, guests of tenants, and employees of the landlord, ### freely walk the ### on a private apartment complex property without fear of trespassing, so long as they do not commit illegal acts while on the complex property.As best I can tell from reading your questions and fact pattern, I believe that no one so far has engaged in any illegal conduct.  I hope for your sake that they stop doing this since it seems so unnecessary, but I think they are within the law based on what you described.I hope this helps somewhat, although I think you already have a very good, solid understanding of the general issues at play.  I hope that you enjoyed your Fathers' Day last weekend, and that you and your family will have a very blessed and productive summer.Best wishes,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43638.1173611111 My apt. leases states no trash or trash can is allowed in front of tenant's apartment else a lease violation. Property mgr. has tenant friends she knows and trusts" to be her "eyes and ears" to monitor and report to her and take photos when possible of other tenants especially the children seen unsupervised (a tenant took a picture of my son on the property when he was unsupervised because they took his picture and then several more pictures to prove there were no adults around anywhere) and committing acts of vandalism. I know it's ok to take photo's in public areas as long as no invasion of privacy and not spying. My mgr. picks and chooses who to serve with lease violations so when one of her tenant friends that takes pictures for her gets a picture of her trash can on her porch then that person that reports her friend's violation to her gets told not to take pictures of people's apartments!. So it's ok for some tenants to but not everyone... I'm thinking it's fine to take pictures of any tenant's apartment ### ### area as that is not a private area where one could be caught with a trash can or a bag of trash and someone snaps a cell phone pic and gives it to the manager.

I was and am in need of a vehicle to purchase. A guy I work with offered to sell his ### $###. I agreed to buy it. He had just put it on the road himself and was waiting for the title to come back in his name. I paid for the Jeep in full. It is in my possession. The gas tank had fallen which now I discovered the under part is badly rusted. I no longer want it. The guy says he had spend the money. The Jeep is not in my name. My question is do I have a case in court to get my money back?  Of course I'd rather it work out without going to court.43643.8652777778 I am sure sorry this happened to you.  No, I don't believe you are entitled to your money back.  North Carolina is a buyer beware" state.  You are allowed to have anyone you choose completely evaluation and examine a used vehicle to your satisfaction before you make a purchase.  The only other remedy might be if the seller specifically told you that there was nothing wrong with the gas tank or the under part of the vehicle and then you found out that was not true.

I hope this information helps.43650.5798611111 I just need to know if what his son is doing is wrong and also I forgot to mention that if things are not done like he wants it done when he comes down he gets very upset. Iâ€™ve been asking and asking for help and have gotten no where. Basically itâ€™s like his son runs his mouth to me when Iâ€™m doing the best I can to do what I do around here and he doesnâ€™t do anything himself. Iâ€™m the one taking care of his dad which is an obligation not my right cause he is no blood to me. Basically Iâ€™m getting used as well I feel like cause when I have no more money for anything I donâ€™t hardly receive any help from my step grandpa. I think personally that his son is somehow manipulating his dad as well I just have a bad feeling about it. 43649.625 Yes I need to know if it has to be legalized for someone to be a power of attorney? Cause Iâ€™m taking care of a bed written step grandpa and I have a very bad back as well documented proof. Iâ€™m being threatened by his son and Iâ€™m scared of him and where I live. Iâ€™m a mental health patient as well. Other things have been said as well. Need to know more please ask. What is going on is that my grandma passed away and basically my step ### son basically took over and thereâ€™s nothing to the best of my knowledge that none Iâ€™ve been told has legalization over anything itâ€™s all been verbally done. I basically have been threatened by his son with him saying if I donâ€™t have so much money to my step grandpa he is gonna hurt me bad. Every time he is coming I avoid him and all to not have anymore conflict. I suffer badly with PTSD and have very high anxiety issues and bipolar. Iâ€™ve been dealing with this for a while now. Thereâ€™s also one more thing if I donâ€™t get his dad whatever or donâ€™t have the means to which lately I havenâ€™t then his dad calls his son well threatens me that heâ€™s calling him just so Iâ€™ll do it. Itâ€™s getting to the point to where Iâ€™m even scared to lay around when I truly donâ€™t feel good. 43649.6208333333 First off, I have crazy neighbors who moved in after me. I am a veteran who has a brain injury from a car accident that causes me to fail about 25% of the time to include with legal matters. I was ordered by the court to move my fence off of their property and I did but confused my dates so I was charged. They took me back to court again about a year later for what I thought was the same offense and I was charged (and shut down by the judge) a second time for the same offense. My neighbor was saying my fence was tresspassing on her property not me. In reality my fence is off of her property by at least ###.on the back property ###, further everywhere else.  I brought in ### that showed every possible angle just in case.As I stated she and her husband are both not 100% mentally. They just want to harass me in any way possible and have used the police with false charges. Actually ridiculously false charges. They have attempted to put restraining orders on me in reprisal for me trying to get them just stay away from me and stop vandalizing my property. With my brain injury and their often childish shenanigans it has been a rough five years.Unfortunately I am poor and disabled. I'm getting kicked around the system and I don't have money for an attorney but I really don't want two charges for the same crime. This to me is outrageous and I'm finding out just how bad the legal system is in ###, North Caro###a. if you can advise me where I can get free pro bono or very reasonable support, I would appreciate it greatly.Thank you.### ###43654.6222222222 I am so sorry you are going through this difficult time.  You never said what you were charged with.  If it is trespassing, then you can get a new charge with every occasion that you are alleged to have ###.  This would not be the same charge.  For instance: you can be charged with trespassing on Monday, and then you can be charged with trespassing on Tuesday.  These would not be the same charge.  It sounds like this is a civil, rather than criminal matter, however, since you were Ordered to move your fence.  If you have more court dates coming up, you might want to call Legal Aid of North Carolina.  Good luck.43655.7701388889 Good afternoon, ###:Thank you for your question; I hope your summer is going very well for you.  No, you did not breach the lease agreement.  You are not an employee or agent of your landlord, and thus there is no obligation on you specifically not to leave a bad review.  Based on what you described here, there was no breach of the lease.However, I would be more ### in when you decide to leave a bad review.  By the standards of landlord-tenant law, two weeks to repair a broken washer is not unreasonable or negligent, however ### or inconvenient this might ### the tenant's point of view.  Writing a bad review just because of this is probably not warranted.  It can take time to fix certain appliances or other ### of the rented premises, and most small claims magistrates in North Carolina who hear landlord-tenant lawsuits over repairs would believe that two weeks for a problem like this is not unreasonable.As far as I can tell from reading your question, you are in the clear as far as the lease is concerned.  I hope that adds to your peace of mind.  Have a very safe, rewarding and productive summer.Best regards,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43659.7243055556 I left a bad Google review for my property being slow to fix an issue, all facts. The property manager texted my roommate who is an ex employee and considered a current employee by doing some work around the property, which gives him and our other roommate a discount on rent. I was not aware in his agreement to this job he is not allowed to speak ill of the property or the discount can be taken away. I took down my review for fear of losing the discount, but did I legally break the agreement by leaving a review even though I am not an employee of the property? My lease says nothing on the matter, but it does state it will fix appliances supplied by the property, promptly which they have not (###), hence the bad review of slow maintenance. 43656.8402777778 unconstitutional seizure of newborn and violation of protected civil rights 43672.6958333333 I recently got out of an emotionally and ### relationship with my ex of ### ###. I am ###, was ###. He was a month away from being ###. I entered the relationship emotionally then sexually at 15, and i have just gotten proof from a friend who's known him all through ### that he entered that relationship while already seeing two other women (this is new information I just received from one of his close ### friends), and has perpetually cheated on me and neglected me for the majority of the relationship." Additionally he has bought me alcohol and gotten me drunk several times once he turned 21 and my parents can attest to this fact. I have pictures of his messages with another girl towards the end of our relationship (he happened to leave his computer open and unlocked while at work and I walked in and saw said messages by accident) where he acted very in love with her and she invited him for a "back rub" back at her place. A few months after that I went to him and told him I needed a break and during this "break" he emotionally manipulated me into sex by saying he was going to kill himself and cutting himself with a ### while I was asleep. I said no and that I didn't want that and he denies this completely. He also raped me one other time during this break. When I tried to confront him with the fact that he raped me and emotionally abused me through neglect (he would only see me once a week or less and every single time I felt and was emotionally pressured into sex with him claiming that I don't love him if I don't agree to it). I have been seeing a therapist since I was 14 and he is aware I have general anxiety disorder and suffer from panic attack yet every time I had an attack he would just yell at me and threaten to leave me. He made me feel as though no one would love me due to my disorders and that he was doing me a favor by being in a relationship with me despite the fact he was cheating on me ### the entire time. He has lied about me to my friends coworkers ### and has been trying to convince everyone that my new boyfriend is crazy. From what I understand I could pursue criminal charges however I would just like to get some compensation for the emotional damage. Is this a viable case to pursue?"43678.3597222222 I am a parking enforcement officer for the city of Carolina beach but I am contracted through the company ### parking. My car was getting towed at my office so I drove back and stop the tow truck from doing so, my father called to police and by the time they got there it was very intense and I was very mad. The cop was insulted me and my dad calling us childish and names along those lines he then threatened me to report me to the city and later told my manger that if they did not fire me Than ### parking would not receive the parking contract next year. I did not assault anyone or break any laws I just had an attitude with the cop and the tow truck driver. Could the cop be penalized for saying that if they didnâ€™t fire me then we would lose our contract? Note this was just a ### not a high ranking officer.43681.6916666667 Mr. ###:This is a very interesting question.  Thank you for taking the time to write to us about this.  It is strongly possible that the officer committed a tort known as malicious ###y interference with contractual ### civil claim with a three-year statute of limitations from the time that damages arose (###ing your contract was terminated which in this case would ### your being fired based on the officer's statements to your employer).  The elements of a successful lawsuit for this tort include the following: (###) a valid contract between the plaintiff and another party (in this case your employer); (###) knowledge of the interfering party that the contract existed; (###) intentional ### by the third person to have the other contractual party abandon the contract with the plaintiff; (###) the defendant's interference without legal justification; and (5) actual pecuniary damages to the plaintiff caused by the defendant's ### interference.  If you can prove all five elements you would have a good case.So far without knowing more than what you wrote here I believe that you can easily prove elements (###) (###) and (###).  The officer might try to argue that as a law enforcement officer trying to lawfully tow your vehicle the officer was justified in warning your employer not to continue employing you although in honesty I think that counterargument is weak and you would likely prevail as to element (###).  For element (5) to be satisfied you would need to show actual pecuniary loss and the value of your recovery would be limited to that extent.  So if you lost your job because of this the judge would need to calculate the value of what you lost as a result of the officer's wrongful interference which can be tricky if you are an at-will employee who could be fired at any time and for any reason (or no reason) in most instances (absent illegal discrimination or any other illegality by the employer).  So the judge might be conservative and allow you say only a couple months' salary as your recovery.  You can certainly consult locally with a couple of the civil litigation lawyers in and around ### and see if they believe a good case can be made of this based on your facts and the above-mentioned elements.  In the event that you do not have ample resources to front towards the costs and fees of litigation you might still find a reputable lawyer willing to take it on if it can be shown that this conduct occurred in the normal scope and course of the officer's law enforcement duties because that would ### that the officer's law enforcement agency could be liable as a result and that would ### a higher chance of recovery since law enforcement departments have insurance ### against which you can recover.  In the absence of such prospect many lawyers would not want to risk doing this case on a pure or mostly contingent basis and then collect nothing even in the event that you win.This is my su###y view of your situation based on what you have described.  A local lawyer in or around ### can take this several steps further in a more thorough legal analysis.  I hope this is helpful to you nonetheless for educational purposes.Best wishes to you this August and fall### A. ### ### Esq."43689.9284722222 Certainly.  Glad to help out.  All the best things of life to you.43689.9597222222 Hello, Ms. Branch:Thank you for your question.  It depends on which employer signed your I-###.  If I recall correctly from my own experienced a while back from temporary agencies, it is the agency itself that is responsible for your ### information, but in order to confirm this, you need to look at the paperwork you signed and were given when you first started employment.  Whoever that party is, I would contact them first by letter and warn that if you do not soon receive your last paycheck, you will report them by filing a complaint with the North Carolina Department of Labor.  That usually will get employers moving quickly, since no co###y wants to be investigated by the state.  This might save you the trouble of filing a lawsuit.I hope this helps somewhat.  If needed, you can also consult briefly (### ###?) with a local employment law attorney.  Many such attorneys will discuss your legal matter with you on a preliminary basis, either for free, or for a modest consultation fee.  Best wishes to you in soon obtaining your ### compensation for your ###.Be well this fall,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43689.9395833333 I was employed by a contract agency out of New ###, however the company that I worked for is located in ###, North Carolina. Will I be able to file a law suit against the company I worked for the contract agency?43685.5819444444 Thank you so much for your advice. 43689.9569444444 Hello, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I am so sorry that you and your very young child have had to endure the discomfort you described during this hot summer (especially in the eastern and ### reaches of the state).  I can offer a few points for your reflection as you think of how you wish to move forward.  First, you are absolutely correct that N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-4###(a)(###) requires adequate repairs to the HVAC unit; while air conditioning is not a requirement in North Carolina, it is required that the landlord adequately repair it if it chooses to provide this feature to the tenant.  So in this case, there is an affirmative duty on the landlord to ensure that the AC is working during the months in which it is most needed (such as August, usually the hottest month of the year).Where the nuance comes in is in how small claims magistrates apply this rule.  Two things must first happen: (###) actual" notice to the landlord that the defect has ### and (###) passage of a "reasonable" time in which to make adequate repairs.  Only then does the landlord become potentially liable for breach of the implied warranty of habitability.  I would argue based on my prior landlord-tenant experience that the landlord can still claim that it is within its "reasonable time" to fix the AC although since it is August and a week has already gone by that defense can be ### stated for only a couple more days.  I agree with you that the landlord should have installed temporary fixes like an individual AC unit while more permanent repairs are still pending or at least several ### at the landlord's expense.  Assuming that this problem does not stretch more than two weeks at a time the landlord is more likely than not to escape liability although I can see how that would seem very unfair from the tenant's perspective (especially with a young child affected given the special vulnerability to heat on the part of children and the elderly).Please note that my analysis is one of gray ### discretion on the part of the magistrates who would hear any case about this in small claims court.  It is ultimately up to the magistrate to decide based on the available facts whether the landlord should be held liable in which case the magistrate could award a rent abatement to the tenant.  I am not sure that would happen based on what I know of this situation but this at least gives you an idea of the factors at play in making such a decision (or not).I hope that as of my writing this the situation has stabilized for you and your child.  As we get closer to September this situation will level off a bit anyway as temperatures will break then drop in about two or three weeks.  I do not think you should have to wait that long but in any event nature will afford us all a little relief before long.You can always request a modest rent adjustment from the landlord if you wish but if the landlord declines your only remedy would be to sue for breach of the implied warranty of habitability (N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-4###) where your chances of winning for a ### lapse of AC would be very close to ###.  I know that this is a tough call but hopefully this is informative.God bless you and your little one.  I hope the situation improves from here.  All the best### A. ### ### Esq."43697.0409722222 My apartment ac unit stopped working so I called the office around ### Friday ###. I called twice for a maintenance man. He finally comes and tells me ### have to call hvac and that I was to use the ceiling ### until someone came to fix it (which is like putting oil on a fire it being ### ###). I called ### (once before I went to walmart to buy a box fan which can only do so much, I have little to no money left) asking for at least an ac window unit and was refused one.

Thank you for this very important question.  These facts are deeply troubling, and it was very difficult to read this and imagine what you were going through.  I strongly suggest that you consult with a civil rights litigator, because this is going to be a massive project if there is an actual case that can be pursued.  Civil rights ### often offer initial consultations either for free or for relatively low cost, so that will give you an opportunity to discuss this situation in greater detail than is possible or appropriate in this online forum, and will help you better understand the monetary value of your claim should you have a case.  I recommend that you search for lawyers in the ###, ###, and ### areas, in order to benefit from counsel outside of your immediate ### in eastern North Carolina.  You can use ### Find a Lawyer" feature as well as calling the Wake County Bar and Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association for assistance in locating the right lawyer for you.

Once the bus ### off today, Mr.### began to look directly at me and my daughter, ### his head towards his son ,and said to me: hey ### why are you staring at me, now and in the mornings you are beginning to creep me outâ€. I looked at him at first and added no reply. Mr ### again repeated the statement but this time added â€œ You keep looking at me ### me out and you need to get some helpâ€... At that point I states to him â€œYou're creeped out, you're creeped out all these things you've done to me, my family, and my home, you're creeped out. No the real problem is you realize no one is scared of you anymore cause thatâ€™s what you try to do was scare everyone, but no one over here is scared of youâ€â€¦ At that point Mr ### explodes and begin to say â€œ what are you talking about, you're making no sense and you need to get some help I Am gonna speak to ###â€. I in turn stated to Mr ### â€œdo what you have to do you've been doing that but no one is scared of you over here at allâ€. I noticed that my daughter seemed frozen in the driveway looking between myself and Mr ###, he was still talking , but I said to her â€œGo In The Houseâ€, at that point Mr ### turns red and said â€œwhat did you say to me, go in the house, I am gonna speak to ###â€.. My Daughter looks at him and said â€œMr ### my Mother is talking to me and not you, and then she finally went up the driveway and in the house never closing the exterior door.

The damages the court would award are not going to be worth the time and effort to sue him.  You should continue to call the police as people trespass on your property.

Anything at all?43713.8111111111 Mr. ###:This is a very good question; it reminds me of when I relied on similar storage facilities during my college years, when I worried about exactly this situation in my own case.  I think that if there is an exculpatory clause in the contract, that will likely prevail in most cases, but if you were to try to defeat an exculpatory clause on the grounds that the premises were not properly ### or maintained, that would be an uphill battle since it cannot ever be known for certain whether the premise owner's failure to do these things actually caused" the ### to happen.  Common sense would inform most people that the ### were far more likely with bad ### than not but in the law you would need to show either that (###) there was a direct connection between the owner's failure to light and maintain and the ### or (###) argue that despite the exculpatory clause in the rental agreement the owner's acts and/or omissions constituted gross negligence and should not be excused simply because the owner states "no fault" (or something very similar) in the rental agreement.  That would require a lawsuit or at least a private clai###serted against the owner's insurance.Certainly $###### but in terms of subject matter jurisdiction of the various levels of North Carolina state courts the sum you mention would place you in small claims court (although technically you could sue in District Court if you desired).  I would read the rental agreement very carefully and weigh the cost and burdens of litigation in the context of your property losses.  If you can find out who the owner's insurance carrier is that would be a potentially useful way to assert your clai### well assuming the owner does not take responsibility short of that.Speak with a general practice lawyer in Catawba County if specific legal representation is desired.  I am so sorry this happened.  Blessings to you and your family this fall.### A. ### ### Esq."43725.2548611111 Also  I forgot to add in that they said they scrapped my car for parts and could you explain the nc towing law for me I seen something saying no more than ### 43722.53125 Mr. ###:Thank you for following up.  You may be referring to N.C.G.S. Â§ ###.2, which I was not sure applied here since I did not know when I answered your question last night whether you were illegally parked on Jiffy ### property.  The statute specifies a limit of ###; otherwise, the ### limit, as you correctly alluded to, is actually ###.  Jiffy Lube is required to notify you of the towing decision in writing under the statute, and if you were towed outside the statutory limits, you may be able to contest any storage lien asserted against your vehicle.  See a link to the statute below, and pay special attention to ### (a), (a1) and (###).https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_20/GS_###.2.htmlAlso, if you need to reference N.C.G.S. ### (referred to in N.C.G.S. Â§ ###.###), see the link below:https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_44A/GS_###.pdf.Hope this helps a little more.Be well,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43722.8680555556 Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  While I do not know the details of this situation, it appears that Jiffy Lube has acted lawfully.  It is likely that the Jiffy Lube stores in ### have a dedicated storage facility with which they have a towing and storage contract, by which they send vehicles unauthorized on their premises; that might explain why ### rather than ### was the ultimate destination of your vehicle.  I am not aware of any definite legal limit in terms of miles, but within reason, any private property owner may exercise discretion as to where to have unauthorized vehicles towed.  This is true for private individuals, as well as private co###ies like Jiffy Lube.There may be some small fact of which I am unaware that could change this answer, but based on the limited information I do have about this situation, I do not see anything illegal or improper about Jiffy ### actions.  Try to recover your vehicle as soon as you can, so that you do not incur storage fees associated with your vehicle.  Eventually, the storage lot owners can petition DMV to sell your vehicle to pay the fees, although they have to notify you as the owner first, in writing.I hope that you have a safe and productive fall.  All the best to you.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43722.0701388889 My former job jiffy lube towed my car all the way to ### is there a certain mile range they can tow my car and do they have to have a reason to tow it 43721.7715277778 Good evening, Ms. Lawter:Thank you for your question.  Based on what you wrote here, your rights to remain in the premises expire today, since today is the last day that your ### the primary tenant and authorized ### allowed to remain.  What you have at this point is basically a tenancy at sufferance which can be terminated at any time by either tenant or landlord, unless or until you agree to some periodic rent ### as a month-to-month, or week-to-week arrangement.  Periodic tenancies, whether implied or express, are governed by N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-14, with respect to advance notice before termination.  Practically speaking, it sounds like you may have a very brief ### a couple weeks, if the landlord does not immediately demand that you vacate the ### stay as you plan your next steps, although you should not count on remaining much longer unless you come to an agreement with the landlord on your own.  If you insist on staying after the landlord has provided the necessary notice that N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-### (or immediately if the landlord sues for eviction on the grounds that both you and your friend are holdover" tenants since today is the last day) the landlord may properly sue to have you removed.  I would try to find the landlord and negotiate a brief period (maybe ###?) for you to remain which will give you some time to look for an affordable apartment unit that you can financially qualify for in an area convenient in light of your ### limitations.  I think you have some challenges in the near future to negotiate through and around but if you can secure at least a month or two at your present place to just plan your steps and think things through I hope you can ### your situation very soon.I hope that October will bring some better news and more stability and peace of mind.  Blessings to you as you work through this situation.### A. ### ### Esq."43722.1111111111 I have been living in this house with my friend, that unfortunately is going to prison, with his and the owner of the house's permission up until today. I received a text that I needed to pay some unknown person named ### or get out. I never met or talked to this person about any type of rental agreement or at all for that matter. I did a property search & it does show an unofficial" copy of a deed with the owners name & the new owners name but I don't understand all of the legal terms & such but besides that what are my rights? Nobody has told me to move I was told I could stay here until my friend gets back home. There's no written or verbal agreement about paying rent at any point in time. I assumed all the financial responsibility of the house when my friend left by paying the power & water ###. I have made improvements to the house but yet at the same time there's things that would have to be done before I would pay rent. The house is not up to code per state laws & repairs that are necessary for every day living. I did text the person back that threatened to kick me out asking that we talk & come to a rental agreement before kicking me out. It is my understanding that he knew I have been living here with no rental agreement or even any type mention of. For my own sake I need to know what my rights are period. I am ### completely physically & emotionally disabled with a service dog single have no family or friends in this area a victim of domestic violence & at a very high risk of becoming homeless if he were to go through the eviction process. I really have no idea what I can do but I can't go back to living on the streets. I do have income but not nearly enough to cover the expenses of renting a home completely by myself. I really need some kind of  advice as to what I can and can't do & most definitely as to what this new owner can or cannot do to me. Having PTSD major depression  severe anxiety panic disorder along with several physical issues I have been declared 100% disabled & get a monthly check but I can't afford to move because of utility deposits the cost of moving just in itself and the security deposits all places require. It exceeds my income by hundreds of dollars. I also do not have any means of transportation at all. I have no way of going anywhere unless I walk & I can't go far because of my disabilities. I've been thrown into a bad situation and have no idea what to do! "43722.0972222222 Dear Mr. ###,Your question relates to the â€œPublic Chargeâ€ rule that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published and had scheduled to go into effect on ### of this year. Multiple federal courts stopped the rule before it could go into effect, and thus, it is unclear how or even if this final rule will apply to your case. However, your petition for your fiancÃ© may still be affected by the current public charge ground for inadmissibility, which is applied to applicants for lawful permanent residency (in other words, ### card applicants).In your case, your fiancÃ© would be the applicant. You would be the sponsor.  Currently, immigration officers decide public charge by evaluating whether an applicant for a ### card or an individual seeking to enter the United States on certain visas is likely to become primarily dependent on the government for support. An applicant will be primarily dependent on the government if she relies on ### for income support or long-term care paid for by the government. If the officer determines the applicant (your fiancÃ©) is primarily dependent on the government or is likely to become a public charge, given the applicantâ€™s age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education, and skills. then the applicant is inadmissible. Being inadmissible means she may not be able to gain lawful permanent residency or status.From what you have shared, it does not seem that your fiancÃ© is receiving any public benefits, like case assistance in the form of â€œWelfareâ€ or SSI benefits, so she should not be considered a public charge in that way.  But an immigration officer may also consider your financial situation, as her sponsor, when determining whether someone is likely to be a public charge.A sponsor must submit an Affidavit of Support (Form I-864) on behalf of the applicant and as part of the applicantâ€™s application for a ### card. The Affidavit of Support requires the sponsor to provide information about the ### employment and income, like the name of your employer (unless self-employed); the date the sponsor became unemployed (if currently unemployed); and the current individual annual income of the sponsor. The sponsor also needs to report tax return information and information about any assets.Currently, if the sponsor cannot show that household income is equal to or higher than ###% of the U.S. poverty level for sponsor's household size, a co-sponsor (or co-sponsors) may be added to the application. For example, assuming you and fiancÃ© would be the only two in the household, you would need to earn $21,### ###% of the U.S. poverty level. If your income is below this amount, you may seek a co-sponsor, or co-sponsors.As you mentioned, from a pure immigration perspective, it is probably advisable to transition off SSI benefits to be able to sponsor your fiancÃ©. (Of course, there are other reasons to remain on SSI benefits.) The timeline for doing so may be as short as one full taxable year. However, having three years of income will strengthen your sponsorship because it would show that you more likely able to sustain income above the poverty line.Having a stronger financial situation as a sponsor will be even more important if the new final â€œpublic chargeâ€ rule takes effect as it is currently written. The new rule makes it much more difficult to have co-sponsors and considers the ### having had received public benefits as a stronger negative factor in determining whether an applicant is a public charge. Because immigration law is so complex and because this particular aspect of the law is in flux, I highly recommend that you consult with an immigration attorney about your petition and sponsorship of your fiancÃ©.Best wishes with your case! 43777.6708333333 I am writing to ask about the public charge components of immigration law.I am an SSI beneficiary and I am engaged to someone in Uganda.  In my state, SSI beneficiaries are automatically eligible for Medicaid.  Nonetheless I've been able to visit her four times.Over the past several years I've been in school.  I'm about to finish a Bachelor's.  I knew there was a good chance that one day I would be able to work enough to be able to sponsor an immigrant, but I haven't married my fiancee partly because I knew I would have to deal with the public charge rules and I couldn't guarantee that we would be able to be together, and I didn't want to hold a false promise over her head for years and years.I also knew that ###, it would just be hard to justify taking the risk of working and coming off of SSI only to be stuck in a low wage job.  I live in Section ###, SSI decreases with income, and the cost of transportation made working seem not worth it.  It made sense to focus first on getting a Bachelor's degree, which could give me a real hope of climbing out of poverty.However my understanding is that the rules are that anyone on SSI is automatically excluded from being able to sponsor an immigrant on a public charge basis, but that even if someone begins to work enough to get off of SSI, the embassy has the discretion to consider that a sponsor was on SSI in the past three years and still classify someone as a public charge anyway.I also knew that one of the benefits of working was that even when I get off of SSI, I'll be able to keep Medicaid unless I make over $30,###.  However I knew that current political events were that the Administration was beginning to look at more reasons to declare someone a public charge risk, like being on Section 8, being on Medicaid or even Obamacare, etc.I want to know if it is best, once I make enough money that I have a $###, to go to the S.S. office specifically to abandon my right to SSI, to help prove that my fiancee wouldn't be a public charge risk.  There is a chance I can add one of my parents as a co-sponsor.  I also plan on going to grad school and I could get insurance through the school, although I would have to pay for it, so I also wanted to know if it would be for the best for me to deliberately enroll in private insurance as soon as I can, so I won't be on MedicaidEven when I get off of Section 8, I am also currently living in an apartment complex that is on a LIHTC tax credit.  Is there a chance it would be in my best interest to move from here?43724.3569444444 I suppose the ### of my question is that for someone who is on SSI and is in school, what does a general timeline of coming off of government benefits ### and becoming eligible to sponsor an immigrant look like, and what are some of the things I can do to make the process possible?43724.3708333333 I have serious medical issues. Requested a wheelchair ahead of time when traveling with American ###. They did provide one in NC and ### but forced me to walk in ### on both legs of my trip. It caused me to get really sick. They offered vouchers but I didn't take them because they blamed me and they really didn't solve the problem when I tried working with them. Where do I go and is this a civil matter? 43726.6333333333 Mr. ###:Thank you for your important question.  I am sorry for the physical ordeal your recent travel put you through.  Yes, this is an entirely civil matter in nature.  My initial thoughts are that this comprises aspects of disability law (most likely, under the Americans With Disabilities Act--###") and personal injury law.  I would first call a disability lawyer well versed in ### and other laws relating to accessible public accommodations and if that lawyer advises that you need to take this up further with a personal injury lawyer you can proceed from there.  It is possible that the disability lawyer could handle everything for you but I am not sure at this point.### "Find a Lawyer" search tool and the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association can help you find specific lawyers in North Carolina in addition to whatever you can find using Google.  Also should you need personal injury services you might consider reaching out to ### F. ### of the ### County firm of ### & Van Hoy LLP.  Its number is ###-###.

Both of my sons were instructed to continue to the back alone. The aide was advised he could not go back to assist. To have a seat in the lobby. The staff did not inform them if there was a protocol to handle such matters nor did they assist my son properly. The poor treatment caused my son to be overly nervous and have a set back.

Glad to help.43727.63125 Thank you43727.6305555556  My landlord is denying my ESA and his reason was it would cause him financial hardship. I never got to say a word to him when we ### a week ago. He threatened to sue me and evict me if I brought the animal on the property. I have followed all steps that I know and have been told. I gave him the ESA letter and then followed up with my section ###. My landlord has not spoken to me since and my caseworker has told me that he has to allow my ESA due to HUD and the ### laws. I have already contacted HUD and so far no response yet. My caseworker asked me for a copy of the letter and I gave it to her but still havent heard back in over a week. 43735.6173611111 ###,It sounds like you have done what you could. Does your ESA letter include a supporting statement by a therapist or counselor (assuming you have one)? If not, then that may help you. The other thing I would suggest you to do is contact Legal Aid of NC. You live in ### which is served by the Legal Aid office in ###. You can also apply for Legal Aid by going to the firm's website at www.legalaidnc.org. The ### office telephone number is ###-###. Be sure to collect all your documentation.I hope this helps!43749.0118055556 I have gave him the ESA letter and he has it to verify. He was giving a cease and desist letter from my lawyer and he is still insisting on kicking me out. I have no idea what the next move would be as I have already stated I have ###. 43749.0194444444 To be clear, you already have a lawyer for this case? If so then I am unable to provide you with any other advice. If you do not have a lawyer, then I think you should contact Legal Aid of NC to attempt to get a lawyer to investigate this as a potential violation of the Fair Housing Act. You can also file a complaint with HUD, since your landlord accepts federal funding.43749.0881944444 It appears from your message that you were arrested for not meeting your PO to install your ankle monitor. If that is correct, we would recommend that you contact your PO directly and do NOT wait for him to call you. You should tell him your story about employment and see if he can contact the police that arrested you. Maybe, if they knew the whole story from him, they would drop the charges. As for the retribution and wrongful arrest, we believe these claims will fail because it appears you technically violated your order by not being available, regardless of your reason.43764.5986111111 i was wrongfully arrested yesterday for a probation violation. what happened was. i was supposed to get an ankle monitor on and i was told that the people would contact me. when they did, monday morning. i missed the call because i was at work and i left my phone in the car. i was told if i didnâ€™t. i would have been fired. i called back as soon as i checked my phone. then the ankle monitor people told my PO that i hadnâ€™t been answering their calls. but they hadnâ€™t called me any times before that which lead to me being arrested for violation of not complying with the order to get my monitor on. i was wondering if it was possible for me to look for retribution regarding bonding fees. as well as wrongful arrest . and for my time that was taken from me missing work and almost loosing both of my jobs.43747.3625 my probation officer was the one that ordered my arrest, her boss told her she had to. the people for the installment told her that they had been contacting me for days, this is the timeline, Thursday ###, i had my probation meeting where i found out that i needed to get the monitor, and i was told that they would contact me, never got a phone call till Monday ### when i was at work. supposedly they called me Saturday and showed up at my house for the installment, we checked my phone records, nothing appeared. period. but they had told my po that i had been avoiding them, which was not the case, and then when i finally got into contact on Monday, ###, only ###, when i work, every day, or used to before this happened, i got arrested for violating my probation and not getting my monitor on !! this is unjust, especially because my PO knows how much i work, and i never got any messages or verification that the people were telling the truth. i understand that they have no reason to lie, but at the same time, we checked the records, and im telling the truth. i was in jail less than ###, but i also haven't been on probation long enough to have had it just be a quick dip, so i had to post bail, which was set unreasonably high for a charge that i had no reason for getting!! let me know if you have any recommendations for the best way for me to proceed. i called the clerk of courts, because when i was in jail i had my video arraignment which means that i got my court appointed lawyer, but i cant remember his name, and when i called the clerk of courts, they had no records of a lawyer being assigned, let alone ANY PENDING CHARGES FOR ME!!! i am still  going to show up of course, but this is one big joke of a case and a mess that my local justice system is making... but when is it not??43764.6201388889 Good afternoon, Mr. Gross:Thank you for raising this very important question.  I am very sorry this happened to you, as it does appear that a couple things may have gone wrong, although to what degree the police genuinely (if still mistakenly) believed your brother was at your residence is something that will need to be ### more closely in order to determine whether the police violated your constitutional rights.  I strongly recommend your finding a local civil rights litigator and asking for an initial consultation on this matter.  You can find potential ### by using ### Find a Lawyer" feature as well as by contacting the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association.  Also contact the Cumberland County Bar Association and see if they have any referrals in civil rights litigation.  You can speak with criminal defense lawyers as well but many civil rights ### have expertise in this kind of thing also.  (Note that many criminal defense lawyers while deeply knowledgeable about wrongful arrests do not necessarily participate in civil lawsuits as lead counsel of record.)Hope you soon find the right lawyer with whom to discuss the details of this unfortunate event in person.  You will have a good idea of what you should do next and the financial and personal stakes involved.  Best wishes to you this fall### A. ### ### Esq."43747.7555555556 Thank you so much I do appreciate it. The first day I was kind enough to identify ### today when I answered the door The officer says â€œâ€˜###â€ what is your first name I respond ### . After I say this he tells me I have a warrant out of ### nc (the area I live in) & I say â€œno I donâ€™t , the cops were here yesterdayâ€ and â€œthey came to the conclusion that i wasnâ€™t my brother. I also told the ### yesterday my brother wasnâ€™t in the state of NC anymore. So what gives them the right to come back the next day and tell me Iâ€™m someone Iâ€™m. It and actually arrest me this time ? Sad 43747.7659722222 You are very welcome.  This is where in-person discussion will be helpful, since it will reveal more nuance than online exchanges (as helpful as these might hopefully be in framing the issues and helping you find the right direction in which to go next).  There are instances in which law enforcement could come back to a location even if they were informed by the ### of a home that a suspect does not live there.  I am not sure whether this was legally justified in this situation (although I realize your opinion is that it does not apply based on what you said to the officers the first time), as the question comes down to whether they had probable cause to believe that your brother was there despite your denying this.  It all depends on what information the officers had at the ### just what they heard from you, but other information that they might have been comparing your account to behind the scenes.  It is entirely possible in probable cause determinations by police to have credible information on the front end that does not turn out to be precisely correct on the back end; that is why investigations take place, to try to narrow the margin of error as much as possible.  Officers do not always get it right, but that by itself does not necessarily make them liable.  Hopefully your discussing this with local counsel in more detail will reveal whether the officers did cross legal boundaries that they should not have.  Best wishes, again, and thank you for your courteous follow-up response.43747.7701388889 yesterday at ### the police department came to my home looking for my little brother. After forcefully trying to enter my home and arrest me I locked the door and asked for the ###. He came I showed my Iâ€™d they apologize and leave. Today at ### cops again this time he forces way in and arrests me. At the station finally figures out I am not my brother . I want to take legal action what do I do ?

I am sorry you are having issues with law enforcement in ### County.  What you likely need is a civil rights litigator, or a civil litigator who handles claims against state and local government entities.  You may very well find a willing lawyer on a contingency basis, assuming you have a good case, since lawyers are more comfortable working on contingency when the defendant is a ### one with liability insurance.  There are several ways you can find a good lawyer: one would be to use ### Find a Lawyer" feature and search for lawyers in ###ville and other places (not necessarily right there in West ### where intimate ties might preclude ### about your case) relatively close by under "Civil Rights State and Local Government and Litigation."  You can also contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association in ### who might direct you to civil rights and general ### in ###ville ### Hickory and other towns of interest to you.

My husband abandoned us, took our money, and for the last three years has used the bait of reconciliation over our marriage only to open a restaurant behind my back,  fully take over our finances, and ride the clock out for the kids to all turn ###.  He has two attorney's working for him while I have had to self represent.  The judge dismissed my equitable distribution request because I had a misunderstanding of my rights and the procedure.  The day he did this was on a court day that I called to seek motions for my ex to compel.  The judge didn't let me have the floor but instead let the two attorney's use this court date to ask for a dismal of my request.  This has been the case from the beginning.  I'm not an attorney so they continue, postpone, and his attorney's flat out do not respond to my request or emails.  They ignore me.   I would like to appeal this judgement.  Should I do that or is there a better effective way to attest this? Is there a distinct law of violation that I can stand on for an appeal?Thank you for any help or direction you can point me in.  43749.8277777778 Ms. ###,I am sorry this has been such a frustrating process for you.  The first thing to consider is how much time has passed since your equitable distribution complaint was dismissed.  If the dismissal was less than ###, I would advise you to file a notice of appeal to preserve your rights if you are within the ###.  Unfortunately, the appellate court rules are very complicated - many attorneys who do not specialize in appeals will not even do that kind of legal work. The appeal will be virtually impossible for you to navigate on your own without an attorneyâ€™s help.  However, it is my hope that in filing the notice of appeal, you can preserve your rights to attempt to get your matter into mediation.  Since you are in ### County and fairly close to ###, I would recommend you call the ### Law School legal clinic.  They have young attorneys and law students who are supervised by licensed attorneys who may be able to assist you if you are not able to afford to hire an attorney yourself.I wish you the best luck.43764.6020833333 I have stalking case. I want to know if I can get it dropped with the evidence I have. 43761.2152777778 Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  A local criminal defense lawyer would need to evaluate your evidence to see if it is strong enough to defeat the ### allegations on your court date.  If you have a couple weeks before your actual court date, I would find a local criminal defense lawyer and request a ### ### consultation.  Many lawyers would offer a consultation like this either for free or for a relatively low fee, so it would be worth your while to talk things through in detail with counsel, even if you are unable or unwilling to hire one for the actual court date.  During the consultation, the lawyer can prepare you for what to expect when you appear, and how you should present your rebutting evidence in an attempt to have the charges dismissed on that day.  It is hard to say for sure what will happen, but the better prepared you are based on in-person discussion and counsel, the better.Best wishes to you in your case.43761.9340277778 Dear Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  This sounds like a ###" situation especially if the friend did not raise the issue of storage costs on the front end of this conversation.  If law enforcement will not assist you in retrieving your property you have only one more option to lawfully obtain your personal property from your friend's ### ### sue your friend in small claims court for return of your personal property.  I would send the friend a letter or email saying that if he does not grant you permission to peacefully retrieve your property within a reasonable ### days ten days etc. from the date of ### you will sue him in small claims court.  Filing fee is $### and service of process through the sheriff is $### for a total initial outlay of $###.  You would need to sue in the county where your friend resides in order for the small claims magistrate to have jurisdiction over the matter.  Hopefully the letter will have some deterrent effect in terms of your friend playing these childish games.

I just ### on your question but did not see any text; did you accidentally post without a factual summary of your issue?Hope you are doing well.43767.0770833333 I am so sorry you experienced such an unpleasant incident, and I hope your baby is fine and your pregnancy undisturbed.  This is going to require a close examination in a consultation with a criminal defense lawyer.  Only that type of lawyer can sit down with you, go over the details of what happened as you best recollect them, and then go have a talk with the DA's office about possibly having your case dismissed, if at all possible.  Lawyers who regularly appear in the local court in the county where charges are pending will have the best advantage, since they have relationships already in place with the local judges and assistant DAs who might be involved in your case at some point or another.  If hiring criminal defense counsel is not possible at the moment, be sure to notify the court at your next appearance, if not before, that you desire a court-appointed lawyer to represent you.  I cannot say for certain whether the cops acted illegally based on what you wrote (and it is a helpful summary of the facts, so thank you for that), but these facts are compelling enough that they deserve a closer inspection by a local criminal defense lawyer.  I hope that these charges will get dismissed, so that you can start your family and get on with your life.  May this fall and winter be kind to you.  Best wishes to you and your baby.43767.0881944444 My boyfriend parked in a dollar tree parking lot in mc so we could talk. This is only his car not mine.

I was using a crisis line and someone filed a police report on my behalf to the authorities about my boyfriend sending my inappropriate pictures without my consent when I was underage  I did not want them to file this report and they said they would have to, can they legally file a report on my behalf without my consent?43805.3736111111 Thank you for this question.  While I totally understand your concerns about your not having had a direct say in this report, it is legal for these third parties to have filed it, as long as they did it based on what they in good faith believed was credible, accurate and truthful information, and did not use any illegal or improper methods to obtain private information about you or anyone else that they otherwise would have not have had.  If they were doing this purely out of concern for you and no malicious reason (even if you for understandable reasons would have desired more control over how any information about these incidents was being provided to authorities), that is fine as far as the law is concerned.  If the police ever believe that someone is making a false report, or a report out of malicious intent, that itself can be investigated, as I am sure the authorities would do if they believe it was ###.

(###) Who did the employees work for? (###) Was information improperly taken directly from the NC Department of Revenue, or indirectly through a non-governmental employer?

This person is a wake county public school system teacher. This teacher was accused by an elementary school student and parent for slapping an ### American student ###.  Last month this employee kicked her daughter out of her house because her daughter is dating an ### American man.  I would be concerned that her AA students are receiving less attention and maybe discrimination in the classroom.  This is an elementary school. 43810.875 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question, and I appreciate your concern for how this employee's conduct might be affecting students of color at the employee's school.  Yes, you can be sued for defamation in this instance, but the more compelling question is whether that lawsuit would be successful.  Let's first start with the elements of defamation, and I will indicate whether each corresponding element is likely met in order for the plaintiff to sue and win.Element ###: A concrete statement of fact...This element is likely satisfied if you made a concrete statement to the employee's supervisors at the school that the employee was a racist.  While some might contend that racist" is a subjective idea that depends on the eye of the ### therefore subjective and not subject to defamation ### juries (and judges) would likely hold that calling someone a "racist" is a concrete enough statement of fact to fall under defamationElement ###: ...of and concerning the plaintiff...This element is satisfied because the statement here about being a racist concerns the employee about who you are complaining.  Definitely established.Element ###: ...written or spoken to a third party...Satisfied so long as you wrote or spoke this statement to someone other than the subject of your accusation.  If written (including both online and traditional media ### of written statements) the form of defamation is libel; if spoken only it is slander.  Satisfied.Element ###: ...that damages the plaintiff's ### in the community OR causes economic loss.This element depends on what exactly happens as a result of the accusation of racism.  If the employee loses her job because of the statements that would definitely satisfy the requirement of legal damages.  Otherwise the plaintiff would need to show that significant damage to that person's reputation in her profession or community has resulted from the statements against the person's character.  I am not sure whether the plaintiff has met this fourth requirement because I do not know the full measure of any resulting impact or fallout from that person being called a racist.So now that I have explained the basic four elements of defamation let's keep in mind that if the plaintiff can show all four in a lawsuit there is at least prima facie a viable lawsuit for defamation.  If just one of these elements is missing the lawsuit automatically fails and will be dismissed in the earliest procedural stages.Now assuming the allegations the plaintiff makes against you are true and provable here is what you need to consider:First truth of the statements made no matter how hurtful embarrassing or disparaging is a complete and absolute defense to a prima facie claim of defamation.  So if you get sued and the judge holds that the plaintiff has made at least ### a legitimate claim for defamation you can raise truth as an affirmative defense and if you can prove that the person actually is a racist you win the case.Second the standard for most cases of defamatory statements is regular ### did you make the statement or accusation flippantly without being more careful about whether the statement was true or false or did you actually ### or try to verify ahead of time whether your belief that the person was a racist was in fact a credible thing to ### to say to someone in a position of power over that person?  If you can show that you had a ### reasonable factual basis by which to assert that the employee was a racist you might be able to avoid liability even if the court concluded that the accusation of racism ultimately proved to not be true.  The key ### from this point is that you have to be careful BEFORE you say something bad about somebody especially if that person's public reputation or ### might be at risk.Third and lastly since you appear to have no direct personal stake in how this person's beliefs about black people or other racial minorities actually ### into how minority students are treated at the school there could always be the possibility that you are accused by the plaintiff of trying to jeopardize her job just out of spite or ### (or even worse ###).  So if you decide to contact the school you may wish to make explicit your ### basis for stating what you believe about this employee and be sure that your intervening can stand the light of day in terms of your motives.  If something adverse happens to the employee of what you said and you were not directly involved in the affairs of the school that could possibly ###; you would likely be okay but this is still a possibility that you must factor into your analysis.I hope this general overview is helpful in your thought process about this situation.  Have a safe warm and productive winter and a blessed ###."43811.1645833333 Good morning, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  Without question, this will require a consultation with, and eventually engagement of, a civil litigation lawyer with experience bringing lawsuits against state and local government entities; it is almost impossible for a ### matter how talented, intelligent or ### handle by him/herself.

How can i do this43817.6895833333 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  This is a very unfortunate situation, and if I were the father of a young daughter, this would grieve me deeply also.  I would suggest that you contact one of the local criminal defense lawyers in ### County and have him/her look into it more closely.  Once you have retained legal counsel, your lawyer can probe the facts and do his/her own investigation, which might yield clues about what exactly lead up to this incident and search in the first place.  There are instances in which an invasive search of this kind could be legal, but I have no idea whether that applies here.  If the school acted illegally, you might have a good lawsuit against the school system.  If there was reasonable suspicion for the search (probable cause is not necessary in most school settings, given the law's ### to school systems, principals and teachers to take whatever means they believe are reasonably necessary to safeguard school premises), the school system will likely not be liable, even if the search ultimately proved that your daughter did nothing wrong.  I make no judgement about whether this search was warranted, since only a lawyer who gets deep in the factual weeds can make such a determination.Either way, I hope you and a lawyer working with your family can get to the bottom of this, and take whatever legal actions might be necessary to vindicate your daughter's interests.

To do so, a licensed medical professional must complete the n-###, which is attached to this message.The applicant has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence standard, to demonstrate that he or she has a disability or impairment that affects functioning such that, even with reasonable accommodations, he or she is unable to meet the English and ### requirements for naturalization. ### alone is not a valid reason to seek an exception to the English and ### requirements. In addition, advanced age, in and of itself, is not a medically determinable physical or developmental disability or mental impairment.The n-648, does not waive the oath requirement.  If you are being asked to submit an oath waiver, here may be what happened.  USCIS may waive the Oath of ### for an applicant who is unable to understand or to communicate an understanding of its meaning because of a mental impairment.  It may be the case that through the form you submitted, the reviewing person believes the applicant is unable to understand the Oath of ###.When an applicant is unable to undergo any part of the naturalization examination because of a mental impairment, a legal guardian or an eligible designated representative completes the naturalization process for the applicant. USCIS waives the Oath of ### and the legal guardian or designated representative attests to the applicantâ€™s eligibility for naturalization.For USCIS to ### a request for an oath waiver, an applicant with the assistance of a legal guardian or designated representative, must provide a written request and a written evaluation by an authorized medical professional.  When an oath waiver is provided, a legal guardian or designated representative signs on behalf of an applicant who is unable to understand or communicate an understanding of the Oath of ### because of a mental impairment. The legal guardian or representative acts on behalf of an applicant with a disability at every stage of the naturalization examination. The legal guardian or representative files the application on behalf of the applicant and must have knowledge of the facts supporting the applicantâ€™s eligibility for naturalization.Persons eligible to act on behalf of the applicant include: A person who a proper court has designated as the applicantâ€™s legal guardian or surrogate and who is authorized to exercise legal authority over the applicantâ€™s affairs; or In the absence of a legal guardian or surrogate, a U.S. citizen spouse, parent, adult son or daughter, or adult brother or sister, who is the primary custodial caregiver and who takes responsibility for the applicant. USCIS will only recognize one designated representative in the following order of priority:Legal guardian or surrogate (highest priority)â€‹U.S. citizen spouse U.S. citizen parentU.S. citizen adult son or daughterU.S. citizen adult brother or sister (lowest priority)If you do not want to waive the oath requirement, I would recommend submitting a written evaluation completed by a medical professional, preferably the same medical professional that completed the n-###, that says that that this individual, despite his/her medical impairment, can understand the meaning of the Oath of ### and so does not require a waiver.Best of luck.43901.7819444444 Someone that is in the process of becoming a citizen. They went to their interview and presented a waiver for the exam as English is not primary language and mental illness diagnosis. Decision was not provided, person was advised that a supervisor must review app. Person received a letter requesting additional information. A process for an oath waiver was outlined (although person did not request that) and they are requiring that person has either a guardian or a US citizen family member AND a medical provider (which the person does have) submit a statement requesting an oath waiver. Person has neither a guardian or US citizenship family members. Would it be safe to submit a statement stating that an oath waiver is not necessary? or would not submitting this statement automatically disqualify this person from citizenship? Could this person only present the statement from the medical provider and still have a chance of being approved for citizenship?Additional info: This person is capable to understand the oath if explained in his native language and might even be able to learn it in English if needed. 43845.7416666667 Absolutely.

You would do this through the Craven County Sheriff, not the police department.  You first have to serve through the Sheriff a Notice to Claim Exempt Property" along with a copy of the judgment; the former landlord then has twenty (20) days to claim exemptions before you execute the judgment assuming that you are suing her in her individual capacity.  Otherwise if you are suing an LLC or corporation that the landlord owns and controls you can immediately proceed to execution without need of waiting twenty (20) days before execution.Contact your local Sheriff's office about this and they can further explain how they would actually seize property to pay your judgment.  While the overall process is outlined by judgment statutes that apply to the entire state how precisely they are carried out will depend somewhat on the procedures of the Sheriff county to county.I hope you can finally get paid soon; I know that this must be a pain to pursue.

And what do I need to prove it? 43861.8527777778 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  It depends on what you are planning to sue this individual for.  One can of course be criminally charged and civilly sued for the same conduct in certain instances (such as larceny and conversion, or murder and wrongful death, just to take two commonly known examples), but without knowing what the person did and what you hope to get out of a lawsuit, it is hard to say whether you should contemplate civil litigation.  I certainly would not do this without a civil litigator to represent you, nor would I do this without significant cash to pay a lawyer upfront.  Emotional trauma by itself does not justify a lawsuit, although in certain instances, it may.  If you want to be more specific about what conduct you desire to sue over, I can perhaps be more targeted in my answer.(Note that evidence in a civil case requires that a judge or jury be convinced to ###% certainty that the defendant is liable for whatever conduct that gives rise to the lawsuit.)Best wishes to you, and thank you again for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.43861.9895833333 May of last year an officer with my local police department gave my two minors alcoholic beverages. Before this officer was even served criminal summons he told me the department terminated him, he went to the court house a filed a motion to lower child support the day after said incident. Being they already asked him to resign and â€œthatâ€™s the highest form of punishmentâ€ for an officer, they made sure he did not get convicted. They found him not guilty despite his own recorded confession, internal affairs finding him Guilty, etc. he was found not guilty because a â€œtechnicalityâ€ the officers who wrote the summons did not fill it out correctly (on purpose, so he wouldnâ€™t be convicted) and that criminal summons error allowed him to get off ### simply because he resigned. I want to know if I have a case to sue the police department, because they did not follow proper protocol when writing their criminal summons. the police department also allowed him to retract his resignation and allowed him to retire two months later despite internal affairs saying to terminate this employee. The police department has protected this officer when heâ€™s guilty of child abuse. Iâ€™ve contacted several litigation lawyers that say they cannot help with this case? What are my options? How do I seek someone that will take it? I had one tell me the police department might be covered under immunity, how can I be for sure about this if they are? 43863.9145833333 Mr. or Mrs. ###:I see you have posted about this situation again for the third time.  I will add a little about immunity and how lawyers decide whether to take on cases.Generally speaking, as I may have indicated in a prior answer, lawyers who handle claims against sovereign and governmental entities are usually very enthusiastic to take new cases against such entities IF there is real promise of success.  This is true for two main reasons: first, since police departments and other governmental entities carry ### liability insurance policies, if a case is settled, or favorably decided for the plaintiff by either judge or jury, there is a guarantee that the lawyer will actually get paid once the case is over, and therefore the lawyer feels it is a good, ### business decision to take a case like this.  Second, many lawyers would find it advantageous to their legal careers to say that they either defeated or settled a case against a police department or local government, since ### like these often raise the lawyer's profile and lead to more cases like this reaching their firms.  Because of these two reasons principally, litigation lawyers will take your case if they think there is real promise of success; there simply is no downside to saying no.So if you are speaking with several ### who go up against local government entities for a living, and they are declining your case, that is probably a good sign that your case is not as promising as your feelings might lead you to believe.  A good, competent lawyer knows after a couple years of litigation experience how to distinguish a good case from a not-so-good case.  We learn to be clear-eyed and realistic about what cases to take and decline.  I would adopt the rule of thumb that if at least five (5) lawyers who are by all appearances experienced and reputable in this area of law decline your case, that says more about the case than it does the lawyers.Immunity might apply, but making that determination on this website would be impossible, since immunity is a very nuanced area of tort law that requires careful examination of the facts, and detailed conversation with the client.  Immunity will almost always cover a local government entity that ### in the normal functions of providing local government services (such as police services, or ### services, just to mention two examples), and the area in which the plaintiff is complaining falls under an area of discretion.  For example, law enforcement has broad discretion when deciding whether to arrest someone on the street who is acting suspicious, or whether to pursue a felony offender or a misdemeanor offender, when his/her radio signals to him/her that both are committing crimes at the same time.  Because law enforcement must make quick decisions that involve a high degree of discretion, they will not normally be sued successfully, absent exceptional circumstances such as (###) violating civil rights of a person under federal or state law (including constitutions), (###) engaging in excessive force, and/or (###) committing a clear violation of the law in performing its executive, discretionary functions.Since I and the other lawyers on this website cannot know for sure what all happened on the police side of this situation before and after the summons was issued (and other things that may have impacted the outcome of the charging decisions), we cannot say whether an error was so egregious that it fell outside the normal discretion that law enforcement is accorded by state law.  This is likely the gray area that dissuades some of the lawyers you have consulted with from holding that immunity can be overcome in a lawsuit.The only thing I can say is to contact a couple more civil ### who handle governmental/sovereign entity litigation, and pick the best ones you can find.  If they do not see an incentive to take this case despite having a large pot of money to go after should this case succeed, that is a very reliable sign that the case is not worth pursuing.  The opportunity to tap into the police department's liability fund is simply too lucrative for a good litigator to pass up, if the case is really what you are hoping it is.Sorry if some of this is unpleasant or not what you wanted to read, but it is a very honest assessment from an experienced lawyer's point of view.Be well.43864.1611111111 Without knowing more about your situation, it is impossible to say with certainty if you will be prevented from returning to the USA. For a complete analysis of your situation, you should consult an immigration attorney who can fully discuss your scenario and/or you should contact your schoolâ€™s foreign student contact. With that said, there are several scenarios that are possible that you should be aware of.If you are working on your F###, and no longer attending your academic program, you likely will encounter problems when you try to return to the USA. Except in certain circumstances, to maintain lawful status in your F###, you are required to go to school and only work under the terms of your visa. If you are not attending school and working, the officer at the port of entry could deny you readmission when you return.If you are still attending your academic program but working illegally, it is possible that you may be unable to return to the U.S.A. Technically, working illegally means you are outside of your lawful status, which would be a ground to deny you reentry. However, if the Customs and Border Patrol officer does not ask you about your activities and does not otherwise know you are outside of your lawful status, you may still be allowed to reenter.Please note that if the officer directly asks you any questions, including if you have been working unlawfully, you must answer truthfully. Lying to an officer at the port of entry is fraud or a material misrepresentation. Either will cause you major issues if you try to renew your status or apply for any other status.Finally, if your F###, and you try to renter, you will be denied admission and told to return home and apply for a new F###.43865.59375 Working illegally on an F###, I have to return back to my home country for a funeral.

May God bless you and give you strength to persevere, and ###.43871.0840277778 Good Evening to you and thank you very much for your quick reply. Your answer IS very clear and understandable to me. I have wondered about this myself and it never made sense to me. My ex-husband or his attorney never asked my permission before he filed the false 50B against me rendering me homeless, jobless, no money to support myself, and most important of all, HE THOUGHT, no means to defend myself against his infidelity. (I had become aware of with undeniable proof).  Why would anyone need my permission for him to dismiss it? This is only a ''drop-in-the-bucket compared to everything else involved in THESE CASES  beginning mid ###-going ONLY because I simply will NOT agree to settle it out of court. It is complicated corrupt and evil on EVERY level beyond anything you can possibly imagine.  You have no idea how valuable your service is to me and how much I appreciate it. I have so many questions need legal help beyond anything you can imagine and have only a very short amount of time remaining to do everything I possibly can to stop unjust and detrimental legal actions against me.   Thank you again SO VERY MUCH for your assistance.Best Regards to you this new year as well.### ### ###"43871.0416666667 Good evening, Ms. ###:This may be confusing or not clear to a non-lawyer, but to those of us who litigate on a regular basis, this is an ### question.  Only the plaintiff's name is supposed to appear on a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, since the defendant is not the party who filed the civil action, and therefore has no basis to voluntarily dismiss anything (although in regular lawsuits not related to ###, the defendant can voluntarily dismiss a counterclaim, since that is asserted in the first instance by the defendant; we need not get into that here, though, since it is not relevant).The Voluntary Dismissal ends the civil action the minute it is filed and stamped by the Clerk, and the entire legal action ###.  So even if there is a dispute about whether it should have been filed, that is moot since there is no live, active case to argue about.  There is no ambiguity there at all.I have filed voluntary dismissals in the past, and have dealt with them on the other side as the defendant's lawyer.  This is very straightforward and is not an uncommon occurrence in the world of civil litigation.If it was filed without prejudice the civil case can be refiled later--usually within a year, although that can be different if there is a statute of limitations issue (which does not appear to be relevant here).Legal authority is Rule 41(a) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Best regards to you this new year.43869.1534722222 If an individual files a DVPO against another and then takes a Voluntary Dismissal (Form AOC-CV-405, Rev. 11/0###) without prejudice before the case is ever brought before a judge, is this a legally binding document if only the Plaintiff's signature appears on it? The document was filed with the Clerk of Court's office the same day with my ex-husband's signature and the date but never mine or the attorney representing me at the time.  This action occurred ### after two (###) prior continuances. Please direct me to specific North Carolina General Statutes that address this issue as it has greatly impacted my life on so many levels,  ever since.Thank you SO MUCH for your kind assistance in this matter. ### ### ### - ELizabethtown NC43869.0729166667 Good afternoon, Ms. Crumpler:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers, and for your courtesy and professionalism as exhibited here.  Unfortunately, this is a common occurrence in car lending transactions; even after repossession occurs, the car dealer can and often will sue for the unpaid balance if it is not paid.  There is no legal obligation to accept compromise payments once this occurs.You have thirty (30) days to file an Answer, Motion to Dismiss or Counterclaim (although a counterclaim likely does not apply here), or to seek an extension of time by filing the appropriate Motion for Extension of Time before the initial thirty (30) days has expired.  If you timely submit a motion and it is accepted, you will be afforded an additional thirty (30) days to respond.  The Clerk of Superior Court will grant you an extension as a matter of course so long as you timely request it and mail a ### copy of your motion and order to the lender's lawyer.If this is District Court, there will eventually be an arbitration (assuming there is first no default judgment due to your failure to timely respond) at which a preliminary decision will be made--preliminary because District Court arbitrations are ### and can be appealed.  What is likely to happen are one of two things (again, assuming the plaintiff does not automatically win due to a default judgment should you not respond at all): either (###) the plaintiff accepts a compromise by which you offer a Confession of Judgment that can be executed against you should you fail to make ### payments as part of whatever in-court settlement is agreed to by the parties; or (###) instead of a Confession of Judgment signed by you, the plaintiff seeks and obtains an outright judgment, without payment plans or compromises, and the plaintiff then executes the judgment against your assets once you claim exemptions under statute in a Notice to Claim Exempt Property which the plaintiff is required to send to you by Sheriff before execution.  You would have twenty (###0) days to fill out the Notice and claim certain exemptions for personal property, equity in a home, and other assets that would be shielded from a judgment as long as you properly fill out the form and do it timely.One way to avoid having to go through all of these options is to consult with a bankruptcy lawyer about filing for bankruptcy in federal court.  If that is something you are interested in, I would IMMEDIATELY get the thirty (30)-day extension in state court, then consult with bankruptcy counsel about filing in federal court; bankruptcy proceedings will stay (postpone) the state court proceedings until further notification, or even perhaps resolution of the debt owed altogether (it is likely that your $7,###, plus interest, can be wiped out or satisfied through the bankruptcy process).That, in a nutshell, is what you need to think about over the next few days.  As the son of a single mother who once had to declare bankruptcy, but then ### in less than a decade through faith, hard work, good karma, further education and focus on the future, I truly empathize with what you are going through.  I sincerely pray that even when things seem insurmountable, that in the eye of your storm comes a peace and prosperity better than you anticipated.  I claim that for you and your children.  Work through this a little, day by day, and you will ### this.  God bless you and yours.43871.9138888889 Thank you for taking time to answer my question to whom this may concern,A Sheriff came to my home on ### and handed me a civil suit from my previous car company, stating I have ###. I not sure where to start, I am a single mom that works and currently enroll in school, my schedule is pretty much full and busy. I need advice on what to do with the lawsuit to sum up what happen. Last year this month my car was repo by ### motor credit. I tried explaining to them I was going through hardship but was willing to give them $### $###. They told me that they wouldn't be able to do so and that I would have to pay the full amount  around $###. Informed the company I didn't have that kind of money laying around. Towards the end of last year ### motor credit company attorney starting calling me stating that I needed to pay $###. Informed them again i didn't have money to pay them being that I was forced to get another car and currently making payments with them since I had to get another car. They called everyday and they finally told me that they will be suing. Me not taking them serious didn't think anything else about it until I got a knock on my door ### with paperwork from the sheriff stating I'm being sued. 43871.7541666667 Hello, Ms. ###,The statute of limitations (SOL) for wrongful arrest in North Carolina is three years from the date the wrongful arrest occurred.Wrongful arrest is generally called either false arrest" or "false imprisonment" under NC law.I am attaching the NC statute that lists all the types of statutes of limitations for civil actions not involving real property.  The provisions that a###ly to false arrest are on ###. ### specifically these two paragraphs:NCGS ###. Three years.(13) Against a public officer for a trespass under color of his office.(19) For assault battery or false imprisonment.I also am attaching a case that explains that paragraph (13) is the more a###ropriate provision to a###ly in the case of false arrest by a police officer or other public officer.  (see paragraph ###. ###)  In either event the same SOL a###lies to both.I hope this answers your question.  Please let me know if you have additional questions.RegardsLinda"43874.9104166667 What is the statute of limitations for wrongful arrest against a sheriff's department?43874.7701388889 Hello, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  You need to consult with an experienced civil rights litigation attorney to evaluate whether your desired lawsuit against the Sheriff's Office can survive the office's Motion to Dismiss that it will almost certainly file.  While you might have a genuine case to pursue, please know that sovereign and governmental immunity defenses are also ### barriers to former arrestees winning these kinds of lawsuits.  Knowing whether you can win by either forcing a settlement against the County's insurance, or by summary judgment or a jury trial, requires detailed in-person consultation with an attorney who regularly handles civil rights cases against state and local government entities.  My guess is that the closest place you can find such attorneys in ###, although feel free to look in ### and Waynesville if you think there is promise in those local legal markets.Try searching using ### Find a Lawyer" search function (it is useful and free) and also contact the Buncombe County Bar and see if they can refer you to someone among their general membership who practices in this area.  See the link to the Buncombe County Bar below:https://buncombebar.com/I hope this helps and that you can get an initial consultation meeting with an attorney deeply versed in these cases.  God bless you and your family in ###."43875.2041666667 I was falsely arrested in ### of last year by ### county sheriff's department. What steps do I take to file a formal complaint and sue for damages? Whom do I contact first?43875.1986111111 How should someone file for spouse to become citizen from Mexico,even though the spouse has worked in US. Many ### cash ,no tax records no criminal record, (married ###)43879.7881944444 My pleasure! Best of luck with your case!43879.9368055556 Typically, U.S. citizens can file a petition for their spouse to receive an immigrant visa, however in certain circumstances, the spouse may be subject to a bar that will prevent them from being eligible to receive immigration benefits. Without knowing all the facts of how your spouse entered the United States and his or her activities since he or she has been in the U.S., it is impossible to say for sure whether you will be able to file for your spouse. Because of this, you need to seek the advice of an immigration attorney who can discuss all the facts with you and any options you and your spouse may have.  You can find a list of attorneys who are members of the American Immigration Law Association in North Carolina here. You can also contact Pisgah Legal Services to learn if you qualify for their assistance. However, if you can file for your spouse, your spouse will need to file tax returns for every year he or she has worked using an Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN). This means that your spouse will need to file back taxes, and apply for an ITIN if he or she does not already have one. You may wish to go ahead and begin this process while you look for an immigration attorney to meet with.43879.8104166667 Wonderful,thank you Soo much. I will do that all rite away. Now I have a direction to go in. Thank you again.43879.9027777778 ### and ###,I updated the Case Summary I gave you earlier to include the following changes:###.  Clarified the FACTS in the first paragraph about the man believed to be ###'s natural father since it was a bit ambiguous the way it was originally written.  Let me know if this explains it better.###.  Revised the advice about FOIAs to include the information about submitting a FOIA online to the USCIS.  I also now believe that it is not necessary to submit FOIAs to the State Department or ###, since after looking at the FOIA websites for both the USCIS and State Department, I think the USCIS should have everything you need.  But I do recommend you submit separate FOIAs for all the family members to the USCIS.###.  Fixed a typo where I wrote ###" instead of "###." (sorry!)###.  Added resources for finding immigration lawyers in NC through the NC Bar and NC Bar Association websites.I will give you some time to digest the information I sent about submitting your own FOIA online to the USCIS.  Let me know how that goes or if you have questions.  Afterward I can give you specific instructions for how to submit FOIAs for ###'s mother brother and sister.RegardsLinda"43896.5708333333 ### and ###,On page ###, I told you that our immigration attorneys suggested you submit FOIA requests to the following agencies:â€¢ USCIS for the immigration files of ###, his siblings, and his mother;â€¢ US Department of State for visa records of ###, his siblings, and his mother; andâ€¢ US Department of Defense (###) to see if they have any information on ###, his siblings, his mother, or his father (he may have come to the US through a ### program).I have looked at the USCIS website and found that you can submit a FOIA request through their online system, and I think it's fairly easy and something you can manage on your own.I ### out the instructions for ### to submit his own FOIA request to the USCIS.  I also provided instructions for submitting separate FOIA requests for his mother and siblings, which I think is necessary to capture all the possible documents in their files.Attached are step-by-step instructions.  Take a look and let me know if you have questions.  I will look at the US Department of State next, but that could be a little more complex.  We'll see! Linda43895.04375 ### and ###,RE: Determining if ###'s mother acquired US citizenshipThis morning I sent an e-mail to the National Archives in ###, which is supposed to have some documents related to naturalization from North Carolina federal courts during our relevant time period (### ### 1986, when ### would have turned ###).  They won't have a certificate of naturalization, but they will have documents showing the intent to apply for US citizenship, which is a place to start.Attached is their response to me this morning.  They can do a records search on ###'s mother if you provide the following information:Name (including all variations)Date of birthCity and state of U.S. District Court in NC where the naturalization was filedSee attached for more details.Please let me know all the towns in NC where ### and his family lived between ### 1986, so I can determine which federal court(s) might have handled the naturalization process.  If they lived in another state during that period, please provide me that information, too (including the years, if you know them).  If they lived outside NC between ### 1986, we need to find out which regional National Archives facility would have those records--they might not be at the ### facility.This information would also be useful for tracking down any immigration papers for ###.  My colleagues in the ### office mentioned that a FOIA request could be filed to find his documents, if they exist.Thanks,Linda43887.6548611111 ### and ###,While we are trying to see if we can get another immigration lawyer involved, I suggest you start by submitting a records request to the National Archives in ###, which apparently has records of Naturalization Petitions and Intentions to ### for the North Carolina through the late ###.  If they come back with records showing that ###'s mother started the process to become ###d, that would be useful for doing a FOIA request to USCIS and the State Department, which would have records showing whether she completed the naturalization process (and when).When I contacted the National Archives a week or so ago, they suggested you could submit the request by e-mail. I suggest you send them an e-mail making the request.  If they want you to submit the request a different way, they will respond and tell you how.  I am attaching a draft e-mail that you can send them.  You can revise it as necessary.  I think it makes sense for you to send the e-mail instead of me because if they find any records, they will come back with instructions on how to order and pay for them, and it would be less complicated if those instructions came directly to you.  But if you run into problems, let me know.Unfortunately, I cannot attach Word files here that you can edit.  I can only attach ### and photo files (JPEG, etc.).  So you can either cut and paste the text or just rewrite it in an e-mail.Let me know if you have any questions.Linda43894.5805555556 ###, one more question -- when (what year) did ###'s mother move back to ###?  How old was ### at the time?  Thanks,Linda43885.8944444444 ###, that's great that you help out this way.  It's good to have a experienced and ### ally!  I'm sure the lock-down is hard.  Everyone is going through their own version of adjustment and hardship.  My entire firm (###,###) was sent to work from home about a month ago.  I actually work from home, anyway, so it wasn't a big transition -- except having the kids at home all day (every day. . . .).  But our firm continues to be very busy. Nothing has slowed down for me, workwise.  This novel situation for everyone has created a new level of ### across the firm.  We do weekly Zoom meetings and chat.  It's nice in that way. What type of work does ### do?  I take it, he never caught the virus from his co-worker?  (hope not)Let me know if you hear from the National Archives--but don't be discouraged if you don't; it just means we may need to wait.Take care,Linda43942.7784722222 ###,I have one more question: Did your mother become a US citizen after moving to the United States, and did she do this before your reached the age of ###? There may be a law that confers automatic US citizenship on you if your mother became a citizen before you turned ###, but I need to confirm.  Linda43883.7111111111 ###,I think it's also possible you acquired your US citizenship automatically when your US father adopted you, but I need to confirm this.  That's certainly the case under the law today, but I don't know if that was true at the time you were adopted, or if the current law works retroactively to the time you were adopted. If you acquired US citizenship when you were adopted, you will not need to apply for US citizenship, you just need to apply for a Certificate of US Citizenship.  Once you get your Certificate of US Citizenship, you would submit that with your US passport application. Do you have any of these documents?###.  Your adoption papers###.  Your birth certificate or any other documents that list your adoptive father as your fatherIf you can answer all the questions I've asked, so far, that would be very helpful.Linda43883.7895833333 Actually, I should clarify- I typed that out so fast I didn't proofread it. I didn't mean I meant to have his biological father's status restored to what it should be. ### has always called his adopted father Dad, and always will. But there was the unknown. His biological father had passed away several years before we found the family but now, he has two brothers, several nieces and nephews and some pictures. I don't know why I felt the need to clarify this but I didn't want to take anything away from his Dad. I guess that's all I wanted to say, so thank you for allowing me to add to my previous email:)43892.7326388889 Amazing! Thank you!! I'm charging my laptop to open this there so I can add in the relevant information. I am so grateful for this. I would have been overwhelmed trying to write a proper letter. I will take care of this TODAY!With much gratitude,###43941.5555555556 Happy to help.I am looking at the USCIS FOIA request website to see if I can help you submit that yourself.  They recently implemented an online request form, which I think may be fairly easy to navigate.  It also means you can check the status of your request online and view any records they find online.  You will want to submit a separate request for ###, his mother and his two siblings.  For his mother and siblings, it could be fairly easy because we have their visa numbers from the passport.  With ###, they probably can find his file, too, with other information you provide--it might take longer.  If we run into problems, we can try to find an immigration law attorney who is more familiar with the process.  But it doesn't hurt to try.Linda43894.8520833333 Hello again!Yes, we're definitely getting worried about ###s. ###'s mother and father are deceased, and to ###'s knowledge, she never became a citizen. He's not sure about that, though. She did apply for and receive a passport, as did his sister, Thu-Van. They travelled to ### to visit. I do have several scanned documents to send you. It shows the other entry numbers and the names are written beside them. FYI: ###'s sister was older and chose to keep her ###ese name. On the passport documents, you'll see references to ### Thu ###. That is ###'s mother. You'll also see Thu-Van, which is his older sister. The other name is ###, who is ###'s brother. Their dad adopted ### and I ###nk he could only adopt one child (not sure about that) so he gave ###'s younger brother his name and made him a Junior.I will be sending additional documentation, but I'll send the passport information first.Again, we are very hopeful and very grateful to you for reaching out to us. Our best,### and ###43886.0159722222 Hello! Thank you so much. Somehow I missed this. We got distracted by the Covid-###. If there's anything else we can do, please let me know. I'm not sure what our next step would be. How can we go about getting that birth certificate? If we could only get out hands on that, it might change everything. That's specifically what they asked for when he applied for a passport. With two kids at home and all of us on ###, we've all been going a little crazy. Please forgive me for not catching this earlier.Our best,###43941.4541666667 Hello!Thank you so much for your response! I'm ###'s wife but can answer just about all of these questions for you.###'s father is his adopted father. ### ### Kerley married his mother in ### and adopted ### there. In fact, on his passport which contains his picture along with his mother's and siblings', his name is written in English, and it's his American name. His father was a U.S. citizen. I'm not sure if his mother ever went through the process of becoming a citizen but I know she applied for and received a passport to go back to ###. We have a certified copy of the adoption paper but not the original. He does not have a birth certificate. Saigon is no longer Saigon. We don't know if a copy exists. We've reached out to the ###ese Embassy many, many times over months and months. We're convinced they're just not staffed at all.To answer another question, his passport looks a little different. It's in a safe deposit box but I'll get it and take pictures.The real issue is that when they came over, his mother and siblings received an entry number stamped in their ###ese passport. Whether through error or a misunderstanding- maybe they thought he didn't need one because he'd been officially adopted in ###, ### didn't get an entry number stamped in the passport. However his name and photo are there. They all came together ahead of his Dad. He has applied for a passport twice, and was denied twice. They said they needed a copy of his original birth certificate. As I said, we feel hopeless because the country he was born in no longer exists. At least the government doesn't. We wonder if he's a legal citizen of any country at all.To answer another question, I am a citizen of the United States.We're afraid for him to go through the process of becoming a citizen. We're afraid his social security benefits would start from the date he became a citizen and not the date he began paying in. I can get some pictures of all his documentation and send them as soon as I can go retrieve them.Thank you so much for your interest and your help. We are so, so grateful.### Kerley43885.8243055556 Hello, ### and ###,I have a final answer for ###'s questions, based on our research to-date:###.  It's almost certain he did not acquire US citizenship when his father adopted him.###.  It's possible he acquired US citizenship automatically if his mother became naturalized before he turned TERM000###95.###.  The good news is -- it's very likely he was admitted to the US as a legal permanent resident in ###.  He just doesn't have a document right now to prove it.  The only thing that could jeopardize his status is if he has been convicted of a serious crime.###.  In other words, there's a very good chance ### is legally present in the country as a lawful permanent resident (aka a ### card" holder).  Having that status and the fact that he is married to a US citizen could also provide a direct path to becoming naturalized as a US citizen if he chooses (if it turns out he did not get US citizenship through his mother).  But he can also choose to simply maintain his "### card" status as it allows him to remain in the US on a permanent basis (unless he does something to lose that status like conviction of a serious crime).5.  Social Security benefits:  As long as ### is either a US citizen or lawfully present in the US (e.g. as a "### card" holder) he can receive all his Social Security benefits. What next?###.  ### needs to submit FOIA requests to the federal agencies that would have information to establish his legal presence in the US -- as well as any information that establishes if his mother became naturalized.  Our immigration attorneys seem confident that those documents exist and can be obtained via FOIA.  These agencies include the USCIS State Department and Department of Defense (in case there was some sort of ### program during the war that was involved in these immigration events). We strongly recommend that ### use an immigration attorney to help him file the FOIA requests since it may not be a simple process. ###.  Once the responses from the FOIA requests come in (can take ### ###) an immigration attorney can help interpret the documents and know whether he is here as a lawful permanent resident or somehow acquired citizenship through his mother.###.  At that point he needs an immigration attorney to help him file whatever petitions he needs--using those FOIA documents -- to establish his status so he can obtain whatever certificate is necessary to have in his file whenever he needs it -- to apply for some type of passport his Social Security benefits etc.    I have summarized everything I think you need in the attached document for taking the next steps.  You can give this to an immigration law attorney to help him or her get up to speed on your case quickly and pick up where we left off.It includes the facts of your case a brief legal analysis information about filing FOIA requests and information about how to find an immigration law attorney who can help you take the next steps.  I also have included the documents you gave me that I think are useful.One resource listed in the document for finding an immigration attorney is with the Catholic Charities in ###.  They provide free or low cost services for immigration issues.  You may want to start with them first to see if they will take your case because it's a low-cost alternative.  If you do not meet their eligibility you may need to use a private attorney and I've given you a website where you can find immigration attorneys in your area and in the state.Take some time to read through the document I'm attaching as it contains a lot of detail.And as I said earlier I can give you my contact information so we can stay in touch.  At some point we need to close out this matter on the ABA forum.  But I would really like to know how this ends and to hear the good news that matter has finally been resolved.Let me know if you have any questions.Linda"43893.8611111111 Hello, ### and ###,I think you should submit ###'s FOIA request to the USCIS to see if you can get a copy of his immigration file (also known as an A-File).  You can do it online very easily, and I have attached step-by-step instructions for doing that.  Since it can take a few months, I suggest you do this as soon as possible.After you have submitted ###'s request, you can submit additional FOIAs for ###'s mother and his siblings.  I recommend you do this, particularly since they came to the US together and there might be information in their A-Files that are relevant to ###'s immigration status.  After you have submitted ###'s FOIA, let me know, and I will send you instructions for requesting the A-Files for his mother and siblings.  Those instructions are slightly different and require additional forms.For ###'s mother's A-File, you will need a certified copy of her death certificate.  Do you have that?  If not, you should order one as soon as possible so you have it when you are ready to request her file.  You can order one for about $50-$###:  https://www.vitalchek.comhttps://www.vitalrecordsonline.comLet me know if you have any questions about the attached instructions.Hope everyone is doing well,Linda43977.5090277778 Hello, ### and ###,I'm just touching base with you because if this matter remains inactive for too long, the ABA administrators will close it out with only ###, and then it becomes difficult to communicate with each other.If you have any news, let me know.Otherwise, I'll wait to hear from you.

I'm sorry I can't send you a Word file to make it easier with the formatting.  The system only allows me to send ### or JPEGs.###.  I understood them to say that you can send the request by e-mail.  If it turns out they want you to send it by regular mail, they will respond to tell you that.  But I think e-mail is fine and probably preferred.  ###.  I think you can put the full request in the body of the e-mail.  That might make it easier for them to read.  But you can do both -- put the full request in the text of the e-mail and attach a Word or PDF file for them, in case they want that (and just tell them you're attaching it).Let me know if you have additional questions.I hope you hear back from them soon!Linda43942.5534722222 Hello, ###,I got that message from the ABA today about closing inactive matters -- so I'm just sending a note to make sure the matter stay active.

Stay tuned for those instructions.Lindaps - Happy Mother's Day!43960.8583333333 Hello, ###,I got that message from the ABA today saying they will close out this matter if it remains inactive.  I'm just sending a note to make sure the matter stay active. Have you had a chance to look at the information I sent about sending a FOIA request to the USCIS for Abe's immigration file?Hope all is well,Linda43986.5361111111 Hello, ###,I received that usual message from the ABA today saying they will close out this matter if it remains inactive.I haven't heard from you since the end of ###.  I hope everything is ok with you and your family.The last time I communicated with you in a substantive way was to give you instructions on how to file a FOIA request with the USCIS to get a copy of ###'s immigration file (A-File).  He also needs to do this for his mother, in case her file contains additional information relevant to his immigration status in the US.  Since I have not heard back from you, I will let the ABA close this matter out.  If you want to reach me afterward, you can contact me at my work e-mail:  ###, and we can decide what to do at that point.Meanwhile, if you feel you need help filing the FOIA request with the USCIS -- and the information I sent you was not clear -- I found this service called Citizen Path.  For a fee, they will help you make sure that your FOIA request is filed properly.  They also may be able to provide additional services ### might need.  I don't know much about them, so I cannot say whether they are any good.  So, please do your own research to see if they provide a reputable service.  Their website is here:  https://citizenpath.com/faq/prepare-form-g-639-foia-request/.If I don't hear from you, I wish you and ### all the best in sorting out his immigration matter, and hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe during these uncertain times.Take care,Linda44013.7708333333 Hello, ###,I will help you get some answers.  First, some questions and thoughts:###.  If I understand you correctly, your father is your adopted father and not your biological father, correct?###.  If the answer to ###, did your father marry your mother before or after you were born?If your father is not your biological father and he married your mother after you were born, it's possible that you have to apply for US citizenship before you can apply for your US passport. I can look into what that procedure would be.  Hopefully, it would not be too complicated (but immigration law can be very complex).If your father married your mother before you were born, it could mean that you acquired US citizenship at birth.  I would have to research the question to know.###.  Do I understand correctly that you have never had or needed a passport to travel outside the US since you came here in ###97###?  ###.  Have you ever been issued any sort of ### card or residence visa for living/staying in the US?5.  I am not sure this is relevant or helpful, but is your wife a US citizen?6.  I do not know -- without more information -- whether you have any type of ###ese citizenship.  It depends on what your citizenship status was when you left ###. Is your original passport for a country that no longer exists (i.e., pre-war ###), or is it for the same country/sovereignty that emerged out of the ###ese war after it ended?  You left the country before the war ended, so it's not clear to me.  I don't know if the government of ### actually changed form after the war, or if it always has been the same government.  As an example, think about Russia versus the ### Union.  These were two different sovereign entities, not one country that simply changed control of a political party.  The easiest way to answer this question is to look at the name of the country as it is written on your original passport and see if it matches the name of the country as it would appear on a current passport (or any passport issued after the war ended).  I have attached an image of a current ###ese passport, which identifies the country as the Socialist Republic of ###.  Is this the same as on your original passport?It also depends on what ###ese law says about your citizenship.  It's possible that the ### government claims you as a citizen, even if you left before it became a socialist republic. That would require some research to know.  Even if ### claims you as a citizen, I'm not entirely sure that the US government would recognize that.  In any event, whether you have ###ese citizenship may not be relevant to whether you need to apply for US citizenship and how you should do that. I will research the immigration rules on this to see how you should proceed.  There may be special rules for your type of case, since I'm sure there are many, many people in the same situation as you who were brought here during or after the war.Meanwhile, let me know the answers to my questions, so I go down the right path.  Regards,Linda43883.6805555556 Hello, ###,Nice to meet you, and thank you for providing all that information.  I can understand the frustration and anxiety this situation must produce for both of you.Immigration law is very complicated, and it becomes more complicated when you don't have all the documents to demonstrate one thing or another.  I am not an expert on immigration law, but I have some colleagues who are, and I also know two professors of immigration law at American University in D.C.  I will see if they are available and willing to help with these questions, as it may not be simple or straightforward.  If they are not available, we will try to identify some other resources for you.###'s mother:  Is she still living?  Is she now in ###?  Is ###'s father still living?  I believe records of naturalization are kept in the national archives, so that might be one way to find out if his mother became a US citizen.  Based on what you said, it sounds like she may not have.  But it could be a very important fact for establishing that ### already is a US citizen.  The laws on acquiring US citizenship through an alien parent who was naturalized seem less complicated than the law on acquiring citizenship through adoption.  That's why it would be useful to know this.###'s birth certificate: I take it, ### submitted his adoption papers with his US passport application, but it was not sufficient for purposes of the application?  Would you be willing to send me a scanned or ### copy of his adoption papers?Which ###ese Embassy have you contacted?  The one in ###?  Did you try any of the consulate offices?  Also -- it may be possible (not sure) that if a document is unavailable because it was lost or destroyed (which might be the case with ###'s birth certificate), you might be able to demonstrate those facts through affidavits of persons who had personal knowledge of the facts.  So, for example, if ###'s mother is still living and can give a sworn written statement about the date and place of his birth, the identify of his birth father (if known), what her citizenship was at the time of his birth, etc., that could be useful.  Is ###'s father still living?  Did he know ###'s mother at the time she gave birth to ###?  Are there any other living relatives who have direct personal knowledge of the date and place of ###'s birth and the citizenship of his mother (and/or father) at the time?###ese passports:Yes, it would be helpful to see pictures of ###'s original passport -- the cover and any inside pages that are relevant.You said his mother and siblings had entry numbers stamped in theirs.  Do you have access to any of those passports?  Are you able to provide copies of the relevant pages?So -- I will reach out to my colleagues and professors with the facts as I know them to see if they can help, and I will let you know what they say.Stay tuned,Linda43885.8819444444 Hello, ###,Not to worry.I'm getting ready to write up some information for you, so you can wait until I can give you the full picture and a to-do list before taking the next steps.  The short answer is, our immigration lawyers in ### have advised doing several FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests with different agencies, and they've given me a list of those agencies.  I will write that up for you.  Unfortunately, our lawyers are not able to take on additional work right now, and I don't feel qualified to help you do it properly.  So they recommend you find another immigration lawyer to help you write the FOIA requests.  They gave me a list of resources where you can find immigration lawyers in NC, either private or through a non-profit (which would be free or low cost).  I will give you that list.But I will write everything up for you, including what our legal conclusions are so far, so that the next person can just pick up where we left off and not start from scratch.We will try to help you transition to another expert and make this as easy as possible so you don't feel like you've hit yet another wall.  I know you are tired of going in circles, and we want to make sure this gets resolved.  I will give you my contact information so you always have a way to reach out to me if you run into more obstacles.So, stay tuned.Linda43892.9291666667 Hello, ###,Thank you for your kind words.  This is an honor to be able to help -- and I hope we can find solutions for you.Sometimes e-mail can cause a lot of miscommunication.  I feel like I've added confusion to the discussion about ###'s mother and her passport.  Sorry.What I thought you said initially was that ###'s mother applied for a NEW ###ese passport in order to visit ###.  I don't think she could have used the old passport either to get into ### or to come back -- unless this was a long time ago and rules were very lax.  Did you mean that she may have applied for a US passport to visit ### and come back?  If that's the case, she could only get a US Passport if she was a US citizen.  Does ### know about when that would have happened?  What year, generally?  Did she go to ### more than once?There is some information on the National Archives website about finding records of naturalization.  I've read through it once, but it requires a second or third read.  It seems to involve a bit of a treasure hunt.  If I understand correctly, if naturalization took place in federal court, you would have to look in the National Archives facility that serves the state in which the federal court is located.  If ###'s mother was naturalized in a NC federal court, the National Archives facility that would have those records is in ###. But there also seems to be a way to order records online -- or you can submit a FOIA request. If you want to look here to sort through the information, https://www.archives.gov/research/immigration/naturalization.Meanwhile -- my colleagues in ### have agreed to do some legal research to determine if ### acquired US citizenship automatically when his father adopted him-- or if/when his mother became a naturalized citizen.  If they determine he did not, they will have some ideas about options for ### to establish legal residence, which can be a path to citizenship.  They also are looking into the question of his Social Security benefits.  I will let you know when I hear from them.Stay tuned!Linda43887.0701388889 Hello, ###,You're very welcome.  I just want to do what I can to help since I know you've been going in circles with people and it must be very frustrating.Re: the biological father.  I wrote it the way I did because I felt I still had some gaps in the information.  I had the sense that ### learned about his father's identity through another relative and that there may be a question about whether that man was indeed ###'s biological father.  So, not a question about whether he was a US citizen, but whether he was the father.  If you believe you know for sure the identify of ###'s biological father, let me know, and let me know how much detail you have (name, place of birth, etc.).  Obviously, the simplest solution would be to establish the biological father as ###'s father because that provides automatic US citizenship.  I get the sense that might not be possible, though.  Are you thinking the original passport in ### might list the biological father?  You would also have to get the father's birth certificate to establish he was a US citizen, but if you know some details about when and where he was born, it might not be so difficult to obtain.I think the only way to get a copy of ###'s passport, if it exists, is through the ###ese embassy.  I will dig around their website or the Internet to see if there is a way.Re: an attorney.  I'm sorry you are being turned away.  As a first step, you just need to get those FOIA requests in, and it would be great if you could find someone experienced to help draft those.Why don't you try submitting that online intake form to the Catholic Charities as I suggested and see how they respond?  It could be you don't qualify because your income level might be too high.  But try that and see if they respond in a day or two.How did you identify the attorney in ###?  Can you tell me which law firm he was with?  There are a lot of immigration attorneys in NC.  It's worth asking around to some others.  If you want, I can help draft an e-mail that you can send out to some immigration attorneys explaining what you need and to see if they would be willing to take your case.  It would be quicker than calling them one by one and spending time in a meeting.Another idea would be to contact the immigration law professors at the law school at ### Chapel Hill.  They run a legal clinic as a way to train law students and provide free legal services.   This might be the type of case they'd like to take on.  I will send an e-mail to those professors to see what they say.I also can reach out to the professor I know at American University.  I know that he and his department do pro bono immigration work.  Maybe they will take a special interest in your case. Anyway, Don't lose hope!  LindaMy contact info.  Keep this for future reference.  Due to the ABA rules of the forum, I need to limit the contact through this e-mail platform for now.  But keep my contact info for later.Linda Trees### ### ### LLPE-mail: ###43893.9291666667 Hello, ###.No rush, and I'm sorry you've been sick.  ###s has been a rough season for a lot of people.Thank you for the information about names and the mother's birth date.  It's helpful to know that ### was the mother's first name.I'm a little confused now, because I looked up the meaning of ###" (mother) and "Van' (sister) and I've read that "###" is just a female indicator (maybe like "Miss" or "Ms.") whereas "Van" is a male indicator (which I see has been used as Abe's middle name).  So I'm wondering why the sister was indicated as "Van" on the passport.  It's not important I'm just curious.If you get additional details let me know.  But no rush.Feel better soon!Linda"43892.5986111111 Hello, Camillia,Thank you for responding.  I wasn't sure if you wanted to keep this matter open.  I'm so sorry to hear about ###.  I hope he hasn't contracted the virus.  Is he ok?  Has he been tested?  What a frightful time we are living in.So -- to get back to where we left off:###.  Birth certificate:  I don't think this is an option.  From what I've seen, there is a very low likelihood that any official birth certificate exists in the ### archives.  It wasn't a typical practice in those days to issue official birth certificates -- only if someone requested it.  On their website, it looks like you can ask them to produce an official birth certificate for you, but you have to provide them all the proof and information of your birth.  So, it's kind of a vicious circle.  I have a friend who was adopted out of ### around the same time as ### by two Americans, and she said she never had a ###ese birth certificate and one probably does not exist.  But not to worry, because as I explained back in March, I have been told by our immigration team that the US government most likely has a file for ###, his mother and his siblings that has the paperwork necessary to apply for the documents he needs to show he's here legally.###.  If you have not done this yet, these are the next steps to start getting ###'s immigration files:a.  Write an e-mail to the National Archives in ### asking for any documents they have on ###'s mother.  I sent this to you back in March, but I'm attaching a revised version here.  I have written the e-mail for ###.  All you need to do is copy it exactly as I have written it and send it to the National Archives e-mail address.  I don't know if anyone is working there now because of COVID-###9, but hopefully someone will respond to you to let you know.b.  Send a FOIA request to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) asking for the immigration file of ###, his siblings and his mother.   Let's take this one step at a time to keep it simple.  Send the e-mail to the National Archives first, and when you have done that, let me know, and I will help you with the FOIA request to the USCIS.###.  Does ### have a certified copy of his mother's death certificate?  He will need that to request his mother's immigration file from the USCIS.  If he doesn't have one, he can order it from one of these services.  It might cost around $50, and I don't know how long it will take, given COVID-###9.  But the sooner he does this, the better: https://www.vitalchek.com https://www.vitalrecordsonline.comTo summarize:###.  Send the e-mail to the National Archives in ### (see attached template to copy).###.  After you have done that, let me know, and I will help with the FOIA request to the USCIS.###.  If ### does not have a certified copy of his mother's death certificate, he should order one NOW.Take care, and I hope you and your family stay well.Linda43941.5493055556 Hello, again, ###,I got that message from the ABA today saying they will close out this matter if it remains inactive.

My father, an American citizen, adopted me and married my mother in Saigon. He brought us and my siblings to the States. I went to school here all my life, I've worked and paid taxes here, I have a license a SSN. When I applied for a passport, I was denied. I applied again, sending in all my documentation, including my original Vietnamese passport with my picture, my mother's, my brother's and my sister's. What am I? What country do I belong to? And how can I get a passport? I want to travel with my wife. I want to be recognized as a citizen. I want to be sure I'll get social security benefits, which I've been paying into since I was ###.Any help anyone can offer me will be greatly appreciated. No one I've turned to has been able to help me so far. Thank you for your time. I can be reached by phone or email, and hope to hear from you soon.Sincerely,### Kerley43883.5409722222 Here is further documentation, including some school records and a certified copy of his adoption documentation. There are a couple of images so the signatures can be seen more easily. I know this is a lot but if you have any questions, please let us know.Yes, we want a passport so we can travel, but my biggest fear is that he isn't a legal citizen of any country at all! Another huge fear is that social security benefits won't be paid out to him upon retirement.Please let us know if we can provide anything else at all that might help. Thanks so much,###43886.0229166667 Hi Linda!Actually, ### is home from work and doesn't understand the question about his father's citizenship. His father's citizenship has never been in question. I tend to go either into depression or manic states when I'm stressed out. ### is much more capable of answering any questions. We are terrified of not being able to find a lawyer to take our case. Please, please leave some contact information so ### can at least clear anything up with you that maybe I've miscommunicated. He works ###, but with mandatory overtime, that runs into 50-###. His number is ###-### and he asks that you please call him. His father is a citizen and what the passport agency has asked for is his birth certificate. I've probably done a poor job of communicating things back and forth and for that, I am sorry. Please consider contacting ### or allowing him to contact you before closing out our conversation. Also, please allow me some time to print out the forms you've sent for me. I'm afraid they'll be gone if our communication is closed out. Thank you again. We are very thankful for you and for all you've done.### and ###43893.8979166667 Hi Linda!I've got some additional information. Abe's niece says his mother, ###, applied for a U.S. passport before she traveled. I'm assuming ###s means she was considered a citizen but I don't know for sure. Her legal married name was ### Thu ### Kerley. As for where the family lived during the years you asked about, they never left North Carolina. They lived in three different cities- ###, Hiddenite, and Stoney Point. Also I feel so bad that you're doing all ###s on your own time! You're so kind to help us, especially when we feel so helpless. If there's any research I can do, I'm happy to. I tried to research immigration law but stopped just short of my brain exploding haha.That's all I have for now but I wanted to get it to you asap. Thank you so much!!!###43887.7881944444 Hi Linda!We were wondering if we'd submitted enough information to determine if ###'s mother had applied for citizenship and, if so, if this is something we can search? We want to be of as much help as possible but not impede, either. The form you mentioned that we could file- should we go ahead and act on that? We are so grateful and want to do our part without being in the way. If we should go ahead and take any action, please let us know. We're still working to sort out the names as well. We thank you so much,### and ###43892.8819444444 Hi!I don't see my last message to you. I did write the National Archives and got a message back saying that because of the ###, they weren't in the office to conduct the search. The letter did say they'd search the records as soon as they were back there in person. They sent me a link to search myself but I think I'd searched a whole back, as in years ago and didn't find anything. Maybe I should try again just in case? I'm sorry my last letter didn't send. I usually scroll back down to make sure they go through. The good news is I did get a response though, which was thrilling!###43951.8284722222 Hi!I have what I'm afraid will sound like a stupid question, but I want to make sure I have this right before I send the final request to the National Archives. First, I understand I'm to email it? Do I also send a hard copy through the mail? Secondly, should I copy and paste the letter into the text of the email or do I write a short explanation in the body of the email and attach the word document containing the formal request so it's easier for printing on their part.When I added our personal information, it affected the formatting of the original document. Not a problem- it took a matter of minutes to print your copy out and retype it in Word. Now that I've got it perfect, I want to make sure I don't make any mistakes. We appreciate you so much and hope you're doing well under these circumstances we're all dealing with right now.Our best,### and ### Kerley43942.5458333333 Hi!That's so sweet!  ### and I now have two children of our own and we're so thankful to have these pictures to show them and to teach them about their ###ese heritage.It never dawned on me that ###'s mother and sister used this passport to go to ###. ### is now unsure how they got there and then back in the U.S. I always assumed they applied for and got U.S. passports. I'll check to find out.As for ###'s siblings, they're all alive and living here in the States. Their father did not formally adopt the other siblings, although his youngest sister was born here. She is the biological daughter of ###'s adopted father and his mother.As far as we know, nobody applied for residency Visas upon arriving here. But that was a pre 9/###. As far as we know, they all came here and started their life as Americans. Nobody ever questioned anything. They learned English, went to public school, and have always worked here in the U.S. They've always had social security numbers.I'm sorry I haven't been able to be more helpful but ### is going to ask his siblings about some of your questions. I will definitely get back to you asap with any new information. We appreciate your time and all your effort in looking into this so far. We're very grateful. I really can't say how much.All our best,### and ###43887.0381944444 I did a bit more research on Vietnamese names, and now I see that Vietnamese is a tonal language, so there are potentially three versions of Van depending on how you spell and ### it.  It looks like the sister's Van" is a surname being used as part of her first name?  i.e. Thu Van.  ###'s middle name is spelled (and ###d?) differently which is the common use of "Van" as a middle name to indicate a male person.This is what I found on ###:Váº¡n: è¬VÄƒn: æ–‡  (this looks like the one used as ###'s middle name as it is spelled on the passport)VÃ¢n: é›²  (this looks like the one used in the sister's name as it is spelled on the passport)Interesting.You can ask ### to verify.  ### is not necessarily an authoritative or reliable source.Linda"43892.6131944444 No, it was his biological father he never knew about. ### this mother gave him very little and conflicting information for some reason. Once he took the d### test, it still took about a year to find a match. It turned out to be one of his nieces. Through her, we learned that his biological father was an American from the Caribbean ###. Although he passed away, ### still has uncles and other family who are interested in learning about him. We think maybe his biological father may have never even known he was born.We know even less about any relatives on his mother's side. They would all be in ###. We can't even find his birth certificate. The only mater###l relatives ### knows of are his siblings. So far, at least.43892.8305555556 Not a problem! I miss working so much, and my work was never academic or professional as I never got a higher education, but it was in office administration, and I always felt useful. Typing out that letter made me feel like that again. Maybe I'm just going a little crazy from being ### up but my point is, I was glad to have something useful to do that felt like work. Hope that doesn't sound too strange. Thanks so much for the guidance. I'm sending this out now. I feel very happy today for some reason. Maybe it's a sign of good luck?Thanks again!###43942.5631944444 Sounds good. I am going to look around and see what I can find. And yes I'm ready for the next step. I'm very excited!!###43951.8513888889 Thank you so much for all you've done! This is amazing- the amount of information you've put together for us. ### works so many hours and I know he's wanted to touch base with you. I do have a quick question for you. I read through the documents you sent and it said ###'s father's citizenship was in question. His father was always a U.S. citizen. He met ###'s mother while serving in ###. Another thing that ### us is, how do we go about getting a copy of ###'s birth certificate? For some reason we can't get it. And on top of that, we can't find an attorney who will even take his case. There's an attorney in ###, NC who we talked to. We weren't asking for pro bono work at all but he just seemed to lose interest in the case. Everyone does. We can't understand why and we're starting to get scared- about his future, about his citizenship, about everything. We don't even know what country he's a citizen of. That's scary.We will do our best to get the forms filled out and submitted, and again, yes, we definitely want to stay in contact with you! You have done so much for us already. I hate to ask another favor but can you give us any information on how to just apply for ###'s birth certificate? We were told by the lawyer in ### to contact the Embassy, but nobody ever even answers. There's no mechanism for leaving a message. I guess I just need to print out the paperwork and we'll do our best, but like I said, we are so overwhelmed. If you know of an attorney who will take our case, please let us know. Even searching for attorneys to hire was a dead end trail for us.Please leave us some way to stay in touch with you, just to keep you informed. ### hasn't had a chance to talk with you and he's so grateful for your help. We both are. I cannot imagine the time and effort you've put into this to give us the information you've helped us with, and we're both so grateful. Thank you again for your help.Yours,### and ###43893.8888888889 Thank you!!! I will get started on it immediately. Thank you so much!!!!43894.8416666667 Thank you, ###, for sending those. Those documents are really precious.  I can understand why you keep them under lock and key.  And what a beautiful family.  I will take a look and get back to you.  I have sent an e-mail to my colleagues in ### who practice immigration law.  I will let you know what they say.Thanks for the clarification about Abe's mother -- using the ###ese passport to visit ###, not move back.Questions about Abe's siblings:  Are they still living and in the US, and are they also unsure about their citizenship?  Did Abe's father end up adopting them after moving to the US? Did they have residence visas?  Linda43886.1444444444 Thank you, ###,Honestly, ###s is a nice diversion from my usual work, and my firm considers pro bono service to be a high priority.  I would not take on ###s task if I did not want to.  It's all voluntary.  I also have a personal interest in war-related immigration stories, since my father was a refugee of WWII.  I also grew up during the ### War and remember how absolutely horrific it was.  (Did I mention that my baby" brother was born just three weeks after ###'s brother ###?)  I grew up in the ### area and we had lots of ###ese come to the area after the war.  They attended our schools and became real fixtures in the community even to ###s day.  We can certainly thank them for all the wonderful restaurants.  :-)  My father was fortunate -- he did not fall through the cracks so to speak so we never had any difficult immigration issues.  I am very sympathetic to others who have not been so lucky.Thanks for giving me the names of the towns in North Carolina where they lived.  That certainly simplifies it.A couple other questions:###.  Birth date of ###'s mother.  It is listed on the passport simply as "###935."  Is that correct and does ### know her specific birth date? (month and day)  The more details we can give the Archives the better.###.  All versions of her name.  We need to give all the versions that are possible to help the Archives locate her documents if they exist.So:Married name:  ### Thu ### KerleyMaiden name appears to be: ### (is that correct?)Can you break down "### Thu ###" for me?  Is that her first name or is "### Thu" the first name and "###" is some###ng else like a middle name or a maiden name?  I see that the oldest daughter's name is "### Thu [###] ###" -- so that makes me ###nk "### Thu" is a first name by itself and "###" is some###ng separate.Let me know if you can provide more details.Linda"43887.8201388889 Thanks for sharing that photo.  It's beautiful.When you say you found his biological family, do you mean on his mother's side or his biological father's side?  I take it, you don't know what nationality his biological father was?  Linda43892.7611111111 Thanks for the update, ###.This platform gets glitchy once in a while.That is great that you got a response.  If you have the time to keep digging through their archives and ###, why not?  Meanwhile, we can start the process of sending a FOIA request to the USCIS, who surely will have some useful information -- but they may be in the same situation where they don't have anyone there to look through the archives.  Linda43951.8423611111 Very interesting! Thank you! I knew from ### that Van was a common middle name for boys in ###. We think his birth name was Phuk Van (sp?) (not sure of the order since it's done differently). We actually gave our son the middle name Van, after ###'s original name. I guess it was a cultural thing, but ###'s mother took many secrets to the grave. Even the identity of his biological father. She did not believe in talking about the past. But he took a DNA test and we found his biological family about a year ago! I think it brought him some closure he needed. I say all that to say this: For whatever reason, and I'm sure they were good ones as she'd been through so much, ###'s mother left them with little information. But just as with his biological father, I'm determined to have his citizenship status restored to what it should be. I will continue to ask family members and get all the relevant information. I am feeling somewhat better so I think it's safe to say I'm through the worst of this and I'll be good as new soon. Also, please excuse any grammar or spelling issues. The font on my phone is so small I can barely see! I'm going to get on the laptop later with ### to look up the variations of the name Van. Thank you for this lead! Also, I'd like to share a picture of ###, his brother and their mom and dad shortly after their parents married and he was adopted. It's one of my favorite pictures in the world.â¤ï¸Our best to you,###43892.7270833333 Are there any resources the will assist me in filing, not representing me,   a Federal case alleging violations of the US and NC Constitutions?  It  involves the legality of using a General Warrant, and applying the Reasonableness Clause of the ### Amendment of the United States and the North Carolina Constitutions in a Satellite Based Monitoring case. (see STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v.TORREY ###), also  (STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA v. ### ### ###, Defendant). And why would the Reasonableness Cause of the ### Amendment not be applied to any case involving Search and Seizure? If SBM was ruled as being a Search in the ### and ### cases, then how is it not a search in all SBM cases? 43883.7625 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  I was browsing the open questions queue on NC Free Legal Answers this evening, and noticed that your question from February had not yet been answered.  I can point you to a few resources and considerations that might be helpful to you as you build your case.As far as free legal research resources go, I would point you to two places: (###) the law library at ### School of Law in ###, and (###) the Supreme Court Library at the NC Supreme Court in downtown ###.  There are caveats to both places that you need to follow: keep in mind that the law library at ### allows general public patrons to come in only during normal business hours on Monday through Friday, and members of the public can visit the Supreme Court Library only if approved in advance by the staff there, so you will need to call ahead for permission as to whether you can visit.  (Access to the Supreme Court Library is tightly controlled and is usually limited to lawyers and judges, but if you state that you are conducting serious research for a federal case, you might be allowed to use the resources.)  Obviously, it goes without saying that both places will not reopen at all until the Covid-###.  Whenever you get to ### or the Supreme Court Library, you need to consult a civil practice guide for federal court, and an updated treatise or two on criminal procedure, including modern, technology-based applications of the ### Amendment and expectations of privacy.  Please note that cases involving what is and is not a reasonable expectation of privacy under the ### Amendment as it applies to warrantless searches (including satellite monitoring, ###, and other technology applications) is a very nuanced area of criminal procedure, and it takes a lot of reading and synthesis of many cases to fully understand how one case is distinguishable from or similar to others that have dealt with some aspect of the same issue.  While you may be entirely correct in thinking that the cases you have already looked at in your research are perfectly analogous to your case, please bear in mind that in law generally, and in ### Amendment cases especially, a mere change in a fact or two can have a very different outcome; the court will always treat ### Amendment cases as ### analyses.  So every fact and step must be carefully considered, and cross referenced, with U.S. and NC Supreme Court cases.I estimate that you should prepare for at least ###.  I wish you the very best in your legal inquiries, and hope that you get to the other end of this spring and the present pandemic in excellent shape.  All the best to you and your family.43925.0847222222 Hello my name is ### ### and I am inquiring and wondering if there are any pro bono immigration lawyers that are able to help in retrieving a form n-###. My social security card states that I am only authorized to work with ins authorization and I need that document in order to secure a job I am currently unemployed and cannot be employed because my i### ###'m broke and can't afford43886.8680555556 Hello, ###,I am sorry for your situation.  I can imagine it is causing you a lot of stress.Based on what I have read on the USCIS website, it's just a matter of filing these two applications together (with the appropriate supporting documents) -- one that requests a replacement of your document and one that requests a fee waiver.  As I understand it, you would submit both applications together by mail (as opposed to filing online).  It may still cost you something -- like the cost to have passport photos taken and the postage to send the applications.  But if your fee waiver request is accepted, you should not have any other fees to get your document replaced.  Detailed instructions are in the attached documents and the USCIS website links, below.I recommend that you go through all the instructions and forms very carefully to make sure you have included everything they want and in the form that they want it.  Take the time to do it correctly to avoid having it rejected.  And be sure to keep a copy of the paperwork you submit.To make sure we have the correct forms, or that you will be able to submit these, I need some more information from you:Form ### -- Replacement of Naturalization/Citizen Document###.  What document you need, exactly?  The N-###:Declaration of Intention (to become a US citizen)Naturalization CertificateCertificate of Citizenship; orRepatriation Certificate###.  What is the reason you need it replaced?  Was it lost, stolen, destroyed?  Or some other reason?###.  Do you have a Certificate Number or an Alien Registration Number?###.  Which USCIS office or court issued the document you need replaced?5.  Photocopies of documentation -- you say you have photocopies of documentation.  What documents, exactly?Form I-9###### -- Request for Fee Waiver###.  Reason for the waiver:  I assume it's financial hardship because you cannot be employed without the document you get replaced through filing the ###? ###.  Are you married, and if so, does your wife have an income?I am attaching the Form N-###-9######, along with the instructions for both.If you have not looked at these already, these are the US government web pages for both forms, which you might find helpful:https://www.uscis.gov/###https://www.uscis.gov/i-9######Let me know if you have any questions,Linda43887.0097222222 Another  legal question  if possible.

Can   those  properties  be seize  toward  my Judgements? 43889.1631944444 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  What you describe sounds straightforward enough that any general civil litigator in ### or surrounding area should be able to advise you without charging you a lot of money.  You can Google civil litigation lawyers ###" or "general practitioners ### and/or go to ### and use the Find a Lawyer" feature searching under "Litigation General Practice and Debt Collection."  Lawyers are ### prohibited from direct solicitation of new clients so whenever there is not already a prior lawyer-client relationship the prospective client not the lawyer must make the first contact in contemplation of a consultation or representation agreement.  I think with one to three hours max a local lawyer should be able to put you in good shape for execution of your judgments.  I hope that you soon find a reputable and affordable lawyer who can work with you on this matter and that you will recover what you are justly owed under these judgments.Best wishes to you this spring."43889.1430555556 I have writ of execution against a person for ###, the investigating sheriff told me I must file another form, in which  he can take the funds from her account.  I am trying to hire a lawyer now, I have been working on this for a while and I do not know the law.  Can anyone help me retain lawyer services or can anyone put me in contact with lawyer? 43889.0006944444 Possibly.  You might be looking at what the law calls a fraudulent conveyance."  When you find a local lawyer you would like to work with ask the lawyer about that phrase and see what s/he says.  This certainly sounds suspicious and illegal to me."43889.1701388889 My Motor vehicle ID expired.  ### card also expired because of situation with illness mine and husbands.  am unable to go to dr or anything without an ID.

You can find the form and instructions at this site: https://www.uscis.gov/###. Make sure to carefully read the section on the website entitled, Checklist of Required Initial Evidence (for informational purposes only)â€ and submit all the documents that are requested.At the moment the government is taking a long time to process these applications. However you should be able to receive a temporary driverâ€™s license while your application is pending. To do this youâ€™ll need to take your I-###. You will receive this notice after you file your case (usually it takes a few weeks). If you encounter problems at the DMV request to speak to a supervisor.Once you get your new ### card you can return to the DMV to get a longer-term Driverâ€™s License.I highly recommend that before doing this you speak to an immigration attorney to make sure that you have maintained your legal permanent residence status.

How do you expect an answer with no detail?###"44102.8791666667 You can't stop him if he still qualifies by the laws.  It would be up to the immigration courts to decide.  All you really can do is let his attorney know that you are separated but unless actually divorced they might still consider you married.  If you have children with him make sure you are filing for child support for help with the children.  You can also contact the immigration offices and let them know he has a current filing in progress and the status of your relationship.  Again, not knowing all the details, he might still qualify and you can't stop it just to get even with him because you are separated.Take care,###44102.9666666667 how do i stop my husband from moving forword with his papers if we are separated 44102.8666666667 ### Notice was mailed to ###, Dover ###.

Don't know what resource center you re using but there is an online way to upload documents and pay for the filing or you could have mailed in your response to the motion with the filing fee.Your best bet is to find an attorney to help you with the Motion to Vacate the Default Judgment and then fight the forfeiture.This service is for giving basic answers not for detail instructions on how to do something in court.  There is a self-help section at njcourts.gov that might have the information but if you do it wrong you are just spinning your wheels.  You can contact the local county bar association and ask for a referral for a civil forfeiture defense attorney.###"44111.0270833333 Hi, so during my court case, my last lawyer and I toke ### deal because i didn't have money to fight the case. As I'm doing well in my ### program and court agreed to drop charges. But Covid hits, and I lose my job, and could not pay my lawyer the money he was asking for so he relieved himself from the case. After the fact that they saw i had no lawyer anymore, they decide amend the complaint, which forced me to respond to the motion. I have no idea how to file or respond to this paper work, and every time i went to the court house resource center, they refer me to the public defender, but a Public defenders do not do civil cases. I feel that the motion to amend the complaint was unfair and unjust because the agreement was already made with ###, why are they changing it now? because I don't have a lawyer that can defend me? I just need help on how I can go about this the right way. I passed my deadline to respond to this amended complaint s the default was entered. I do not believe this is fair at all. What can i do? I'd attach all the paper work they sent me, but the attachment max is ### so if needed they are available.44110.6777777778 I also have his tax returns to prove it too.44111.0236111111 It is not drug money, its my uncles savings from working as a ### getting paid cash. I had a letter from the owner of the construction company he worked for saying he did work for him and got paid in cash. And i only owned one phone the other was a friend asking me if i could repair his phone before he dropped me off at the airport. I tried to go to the court to get help to file a response but to no avail during the pandemic, i wasn't allowed in. I was given the resource center and they pointed me to here. There is no other reason besides simply not knowing how to respond/file a response and I did everything i could to find help to respond. So my question is how do i go about it this now that they went with the final decision?44111.0201388889 The issue is if it is ### ###'s money and not yours, he should be the one fighting for it.  As far as the drug dealing references, it is just what I read in the police officer statement about two ### phones in a car with one person in the car, the text about someone having the dough and the other text asking if they can come pick up the product.  Mr. ### should be the one filing the Motion to Vacate and will have to explain why he failed to accept the certified mail and failed to file a response within the time required.  After the default judgment is vacated, then it goes back to trying to prove the money is his.  Again, if it is his money and not yours, he needs to be doing this.44111.0479166667 Your criminal case and the civil case for forfeiture of drug money are two different cases.  Usually when you enter ### you are admitting guilt but getting a deal that if you stay clean that the charges will go away.  This doesn't change the forfeiture case.  For the forfeiture case you would have to actually answer the motion instead of not acce###ng the certified mail they sent.  When they mail the notices they send certified and regular mail.  As long as the regular mail is not returned as the person does not live there, the unaccepted certified mail doesn't matter.   You would have been required to file an answer to the motion within the time limit and ask for an oral hearing to argue the case.  If you got that far, please explain how you had almost $###?  Do you have proof of how you earned this $###?  You would have to file a motion to vacate the default judgment with a very good explanation why you did not answer in time when you received the notice mailed to you and Mr. ### received the regular mail notice but did not accept the certified mail.As far as amending the civil complaint was to add Mr. ### to it to give him a chance to argue against the forfeiture but he refused to accept the certified mail or answer the motion that was also mailed to him.At this point you would need to find a local attorney to see if they might help you to file a motion to vacate and then argue the case for forfeiture of the drug dealing money.Good luck.###44110.7333333333 I looked at the case and it looks like you got off easy with that amount based on the evidence.

They are there to work out a deal within the confines of the law and to try to give the children an equal parenting time situation.  You screwed up when you took the children and would not return them (kidnapping).I have provided the information I can without having the intire case file to review and that is out of the scope of this free service.I am done dealing with you.

You just need to learn to do things for the children best interest.  The courts want the kids to have equal time with both parents unless there are special considerations.  The court also ordered the ex as the parent of primary residence which means she gets to make the school decisions.Didn't the appellate court deny your motion on 12/8?  Yes, they entertain all applications because they need to review them, that doesn't mean you actually had legitimate grounds which is probably why it was denied.Again, you need to learn to work with everyone and come to a middle ground compromise.What exactly are you looking for the final outcome to be?

I would recommend reporting this to the New Jersey's Attorney General's Office: https://www.state.nj.us/lps/dcj/tips-form.htmBest of luck.Sincerely,### J. ###, Esq.44191.61875 Thank you we have already done that. Reported it to the AG of ### & OK. So now weâ€™re looking for help with dealing with the banks as no one has gotten back to us that can help us.44191.7451388889 We're a military family that are victims of a Ponzi scheme. I have contacted & filed reports with every agency I can think of (FTC, SEC, CFPB, police etc). Long story short we knew the individual who scammed us through a ### program I partook in years ago and this person came really highly regarded. He approached us w/ an investment/credit repair opportunity that was a completely done for you service. The individual obtained every single piece of ### information from us and was able to increase our credit score so we went from 30K in available credit to 104K. Due to his prior history of providing loans to students in the ### program I took part in I thought the investment would be a loan he provided. Instead credit cards started showing up at our home. I asked him if they were from him and he said yes. So he opened up these accounts in our name, charged our cards for 104K (under different shell company names) after we provided the card numbers to him, and provided us the minimum checks every month to make the payments under the guise of showing a payment history w/ the companies. The investment part of the opportunity was allowing him to borrow the money to help other businesses qualify for bigger lines of credit as well in which we would earn 20% off our investment" paid quarterly. We signed a contract and the guy ran our cards in May so we're past the ###. I'm not sure what to say when reaching out to the banks as ###. We currently owe ### after interest. Every above named federal agency says that they don't deal with individual claims and because he wasn't with a corporation they don't handle it. Lawyers won't help us because he wasn't with a brokerage. No goods or services were provided the contract was a fraudulent contract and the special investigations unit of the military told us to tell our banks it was ### of fraud. We are looking at having to claim bankruptcy if we can't get the charges removed. My question is:Is there a template I can send to my banks? Or what can I say to my banks to get them to remove the charges off our cards? Is there help for victims of scams like this?

I want to file a complaint and redo the decision in public, but need to know how.  I have read that I have ###, but it is not clear how to do that.44205.9930555556 And on this one: You might not like what they do but they were voted in and they have the power until the next election.  Might be time to run for council and get a group to run with you and take as may ### as possible."We did get a group together and in a write in campaign two of our group was voted in to town council.  But before they took office two things happened:The land use ### I mention above happened on ###th right before new members could weigh in and it was fast tracke through skipping several steps.And the township attorney told the two council-elect that they could meet behind closed doors to discuss how they would vote on appointments.  In that meeting the existing members of the town council told the new guys they could have a couple new people in the township who applied in attempt to balance out the land use board in as alternates... without any professionals or public in that meeting they didn't really understand the ### of alternates they just thought they had taken a step in balancing out that board for the common good.   Had this been debated publically I'm sure that the other members of our group would have caught on and addressed it in public comment.  Instead it ended up with unanimous voting in on ###th of the appointments of all the boards by the town council.  The ### weren't read out loud to the public just that resolution "2021-1-6" was read as a part of consent agenda and voted unanimously.  That resolution wasn't made available for the public to read until after that meeting. On ###th one of the new councilmembers and the old council members then openly debated to reconsider who was an alternate and who wasn't and that's when it was announced that the ###th discussion took place.So the whole hope of turning things around in the community after months of heated public comment and a successful write in campaign had a chance to correct where we weren't happy with the land use board.  That was all done and decided behind closed doors... and why I'm even considering taking the town professional's "go get a lawyer" advice in the first place.  Looking forward to your take on all of this...- ### "44214.1465277778 Hi ###,The town council had an unannounced closed meeting to discuss their ###. The meeting was not announced to the public, and when they had the public meeting for reorg happen on the ###, it was done unanimously with no debate. In the next regular meeting on the 7th, the township council had an agenda item to discuss that one member misunderstood how the land use board works and they wanted to reconsider who was an alternate versus who was a primary. In the discussion that happened, one member informed another member, that in the unannounced closed meeting of all ###, that they had debated who would be deputy mayor, and who would be town professionals, and because member ### ###, that member ###â€™t be rehashing decisions that had been agreed upon behind closed doors. Had this debate been done in public, public comment may have contributed that they wanted the council to consider who was alternate versus primary, but that opportunity was not provided. So what Iâ€™ve read is this closed door meeting was illegal because it debated how the town council should vote without the public able to witness or participate in that debate. In the same meeting, I expressed concerns that the joint land use board had knowingly voted something in place in direct violation with the township ordinances and that the land use lawyer told me that if I had an issue with it I should take legal action. I asked the town council if they would be willing to work outside of court to address this, and the town councilâ€™s lawyer indicated that the town council didnâ€™t have any jurisdiction over the land use board votes and implied I should deal with it the way the land use lawyer implied.so on the one hand the appointment of the new land use board isnâ€™t being done openly and honestly, and on the other hand the land use board is openly acting against township ordinances, even after it being mentioned in open public comment, and the council is unwilling to do anything about it.I donâ€™t want to start undue drama or have to cause a financial drain on the township, but I want the town run properly and to follow the rules.  But theyâ€™ve told me theyâ€™re unwilling to follow the rules unless the court is involved, and if thatâ€™s what it takes to hold leadership accountable then Iâ€™m willing to take that step.So I want to file complaints or injunctions or whatever it takes formally for all of this to start working within the rules again, and thank you for the advice that I can do this both with the AG and the State.  What I canâ€™t figure out is: how do I do this?  The only things I could find online is a court case that was thrown out of court because it wasnâ€™t filed correctly.  On the state site I found a bunch of topics on WHAT I could do but not HOW to do it  Is there a link to forms online or an instruction manual or something like that?  Thank you,- ###44213.8916666667 If the closed session was conducted at 6PM prior to a regular public session, then they did nothing wrong.https://www.mansfieldtwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Resolution-2020-1-8-Meetings.pdfAs far as the zoning issue and what you consider bad votes, you will have to file the complaint with the state in court.  Same prerogative writs type of complaint but something like this would help f you had a land use attorney.  Without the proper legal argument that the land use board did something wrong it will get thrown out a motion to dismiss.As far as the vote on the final plan, that vote could have included all the requested changes.  The construction permitting would have to make sure all meets the plans.  Not sure if you are a neighboring property or someone in the town that doesn't want warehouses.  I is difficult to fight these things because those companies have lawyers and they know all the state laws that the towns must also follow.Take care,###44214.1625 If you want to file, you would file a complaint in the law division, civil court, Burlington County.

They are allowed to have closed sessions.  They aren't allowed to make final decisions or votes.  Those have to be done at pubic meetings.  But, the long discussions and negotiations are not required to be part of any public meeting.  The public, in public meetings has the right to listen and talk during public comment.  The public does not have a right to join in any debate or discussion about what the council plans on deciding.As far as the land use board, they are correct, council appoints board members.  The board makes decisions to allow items to pass based on advice from the professionals (attorney and engineers) and public comment is permitted at the meetings, but that is about it.  An application for variances, etc. is to get permission to do something against the zoning code.  The board gets to make those decisions and council is not supposed to have any influence.You might not like what they do, but they were voted in and they have the power until the next election.

The ###d gets to make those decisions and council is not supposed to have any influence."Maybe a bit more information here: The three points made in public comment on an application were:The township zoned a parcel of land as redevelopment based on the land being vacant and unimproved for ###.  I pointed out that the land was active farmland and occupied residential up until last year and that the zoning was based on wrong premises by the professionals.  The township has an ordinance on how the land use ###d is supposed to operate.  In it there's something that says that if plans need to be changed that preliminary approval is granted but final approval cannot be granted until the applicant comes back with the amended plans.  The ###d attorney took a long list of things that the ###d members wanted the applicant to change but then advised the land use ###d they could vote final approval that night.Up until August the township had an Environmental Commission that was supposed to review all land use applications.  They did away with the EC in August and replaced it with an Environmental Advisory Commission in October.  When asked if the application was reviewed by the EAC the township hire engineer (giving advise I don't think should be coming from a planner) gave false information that the neither the EAC nor the EC existed when the application was submitted in ### and could therefore not be held accountable to those ordinances.When I announced in final comment that they had made a vote on misinformation I was dismissed by the land use ###d lawyer indicating something along the lines of "it doesn't matter the voting is done and if you have a problem with that take it up with the courts".  What I had read online somewhere is that if a member of the township payroll is blatantly not following the township ordinances then instead of going to court you're supposed to make an attempt to settle it out of court... so I figured that would be with the township council since they vote in the ordinances.  So if that's wrong how do I make sure that the land use ###d doesn't continue to break the rules at the advise of misinformation from the professionals the land use ### has on staff?  And if possible reverse the vote of "final approval" until final plans are submitted on the vote that was made on ###th?If this is a different case or complaint I appreciate the guidance on how to file this formally or what next steps to take?Thanks again- ### "44214.1319444444 So, I have to ask, how did you know this was ###?  The meeting behind closed doors was held on ###nd, a Saturday afternoon.  All township council members (the three that were previously in office and the two that hadn't been sworn in yet) were present, and that's it.  No township administrator or clerk, no minutes, no prior announcement that any of this was taking place.  So, if this is complaint worthy, I'll give that office a call.  If I want to take that further, how do I find a lawyer with an expertise in OPMA law?  On the land use thing: yes, I live in ### County currently; I moved into the state about ###.  My wife is third generation ###, and most of the people I know in ### are there (and unhappy with where things are going, and I'm happy to help in that cause).  I still am a board member of a non-profit watershed association in ###, too, if that matters. Is this only going to work if the person filing the complaint meets some legal interest in their own property, i.e. being a member of a non-profit in the township and generally caring about my friends and family in the neighboring town isn't enough, this only works if I think my property value will go down?  There are enough people in the township that could be that voice if I'm not the best fit for the job.  I just happen to have done the reading and was the one told to speak to our lawyers".     So if court and formalized is our only option how do we find a land use lawyer?  Everything I've just looked up it's land use lawyers who can help you close on a piece of property and get an application through a land use board not anyone who would build a case against a township taking liberties with ordinances and land use law at the detriment of a lot of people...- ### "44214.21875 So, the only thing that they might have done wrong is not have the resolution allowing the closed session in the future and you are sure of that.

This is about a UI hearing I had back in ###10. I was never sent a copy of my employer's protest letter contesting my award of benefits at the initial claims hearing. The Examiner defaulted judgment in my favor because my employer had no reply to our detailed questions" when given multiple opportunities to respond on a "misconduct connected to the work" charge. When the employer appealed it sent a "protest letter" containing its pleadings.  Neither the The Tribunal or the employer bothered to send me a copy. That letter contained critical information to a responsive defense of my claim. It stated a cause of action ### "misconduct charge" accusuing me of having "abandoned my job" and that I was " the moving party in the separation" and never called out at all for five days. Those five days were specifically stated in the protest letter and I was unaware the employer had certified that these were the days I was purported to be a "no call....no show" since I never got a copy of the protest letter. . A secret document  called an "attendance record" was faxed to the Examiner by the employer ###. At the employer's Tribunal Appeals hearing I was confronted by the Examiner drilling me under oath to confirm the employer's new dates for the of my purported being a "no call...no show" without my knowledge that the employer had already certified the original dates in the protest letter. My defense should have been to object that the Examiner was asking me to testify to facts the employer had already pleaded but because I was unaware of the original pleadings I could not forsee that defense. Was I denied due process and a right to a fair hearing?"44364.9395833333 If I live in a One Party Consent State and record a conversation with a business located in my state with officers of that business, what happens if the business suddenly claims that one participant was working from home in a ###.

Understood on the credit card, he's an authorized user, so I know that falls on me. Even though we had a verbal agreement, I know there's not much I can do there For the apartment, please see my answers below:When you say they know you moved out did you follow the proper notice requirements as listed in the lease - in writing, etc.? - Yes, they knew I was moving out and his mother was supposed to take my place on the lease and for financial responsibility. . From him, he keeps telling me that she turned in the paperwork to verify her income, but the property confirmed she hasn't turned in anything. Since she didn't turn in paperwork, it automatically defaulted to me in the renewal. Which I never signed, this is why I'm nervous about the following renewals. My goal is to dissolve myself of any further financial responsibility so I would like the lease to end as soon as legally possible. When did you move out? ###21When does/did the current lease expire? - Double-checking, but I'm pretty sure it's ###22, it renewed right when I moved out. 44406.8472222222 Hi! Myself and an ex lived together, both names on the lease. We broke up, I moved out, the property is aware that I've moved. The lease was renewed for one year. I want to make sure he can't renew for another year. The property is telling me that I can't do that, but then I'm financially tied to this apartment until he decided to give up the apartment. I feel like I should have more rights. 75% of the security deposit is mine from a previous apt. In an ideal situation, I do not want him to live out the security deposit". He (ex-boyfriend) also has a credit card that we both have that he's now stopped paying. He(ex-boyfriend) is no longer answering my communications. "44406.8041666667 So, you didn't give proper written notice that you were terminating the lease and would not be renewing?  You might want to try to terminate the lease now and pay whatever penalty month of two they might try to get from you.You might need to get a local landlord/tenant attorney to work on this for you if you can't get landlord to accept your written notice sent certified like the lease says to stop your current lease.###44407.0104166667 When you say they know you moved out did you follow the proper notice requirements as listed in the lease - in writing, etc.?  When did you move out?  When does/did the current lease expire?  Any renewal lease should be only if both sign it.  Until the lease expires you are both responsible for the current lease.  Your ex should have to re-apply for the place and get his own lease once the current one expires.As far as the credit card, if a joint account, you are both responsible.  If one person owns the account and the other is just an authorized user, the owner of the card is responsible.  If you own the card and he is just an authorized user you might have to close the account if they won't let you remove his authorization.  If a joint card you should be able to ask to close it and deal with the balance from that point on.###44406.8333333333 I need to apply to TPS, but i don't know if after this mistake with the IRS i can do it?.

With a diagnosis of ###D, which you gladly accept to get the compensation, you have to deal with the extra scrutiny when it comes to purchasing a gun.  Again, if you do not have the disorder, the VA might want to know that to stop paying the compensation since you don't have it according to your own personal diagnosis.And yes, answering the forms ### is fraud.

You then started arguing about different applications which is an apples and oranges argument, it is not the same when it comes to weapons.  You also stated how you filled out the forms and answered the questions because even though you have a diagnosis for a disorder that you applied for compensation and receive but now state you don't have a disorder because in your medical knowledge you state the you have ### but not ###D.  ###D is ratable by VA for compensation, not ###.  If that is the case, then please contact the VA and have them downgrade your disability compensation rating.

Will that eviction stay on our records for life?????44104.725 Hello there.  In Florida, there are set criteria in the statutes for expungement of criminal charges, not civil cases.  Eviction would fall under civil cases.  You can file a petition with the court to ask a judge to expunge or seal your case, but you would need to show a compelling reason why your case should be closed.  For example, the case may contain confidential information, or may put the person at risk at harm if the information were public.  If you simply ask to expunge it because you don't want it on your record, it is unlikely to get approved.  And there is no guarantee on anything, because as stated, there are no statutory requirements or guarantees like there are with criminal cases.  You would need to make a compelling argument.### ###, Esq.JA Law44104.8111111111 If it's true that this will be on our records permanently,  what can we do to expunge it from our record???44104.7270833333 ###.

The link is:  http://missourilawyershelp.org/find-lawyer/However you may have difficulty finding an attorney willing to handle your claim on a contingency basis.   You may need to pay an attorney on an hourly basis.Best wishes.43438.7423611111 I pretty much need to know what to say or how to word filing a motion to set aside a default judgement43447.86875 I recognize that everyone thinks what we lawyers do is no big deal and all it takes is a form but its not quite that simple.  In order to get a default judgment set aside you must file a motion to set aside the judgment (as you seemingly have learned) but the rule requires that you present evidence that you have a meritorious defense and that your failure to appear and defend the case was for excusable neglect.  I forgot or I was late to the courthouse won't cut it for excusable neglect.  Additionally, the requirement that you have a meritorious defense precludes you from just getting it set aside to drag it out longer if you don't have a defense to the case.Your motion to set aside should have numbered paragraphs outlining that suit was filed on [date]. That you were never served or that service was improperly made or that service was made on [date]. That you have a meritorious defense based upon ... That you did not appear before this court on [date] because: never received the summons or some other reason that will constitute excusable neglect.  Technically for it to be proper evidence it must be supported by an affidavit or you can have the motion be verified by adding an attestation clause and signing it in front of a notary public.You will then need to have it set for hearing and send out a notice of hearing to the other side with the date and time that it is set for hearing.  You will need to get the date and time from the court clerk to place on the notice of hearing.  When you appear for the hearing on the motion to set aside you will have to explain to the judge the reasons behind your excusable neglect as well as your meritorious defense.  To be clear this information should already be in the motion that you submitted but the judge is likely to ask you questions about the specifics.  You also need to understand that this will only get the judgment set aside but it will be quickly reinstated if you do not have a defense to the matter.  Lastly, it is important to file your motion to set aside and have it heard as quickly as possible as there is a more stringent standard for granting the motion more than ###.  It is also significantly more difficult to get it set aside more than one year after the judgment was entered.That is about all I can do to assist you without drafting it for you.  If the amount at issue is significant you should strongly consider hiring an attorney to represent you in this matter or think about filing bankruptcy.43447.8965277778 I was a victim to a domestic violence case (actually over 3)...At the Pretrial Conference the new prosecuting attorney filed a ### ###.

It is not for how to" questions.  Your inquiry is far too broad for this site and seeks a tutorial for self-representation in an administrative proceeding.

You will need to familiarize yourself with the federal Administrative Procedures Act federal Rules of Civil Procedure and any specific agency rules related to your case.You would likely be well-advised to retain an attorney for representation rather than trying to represent yourself.

Furthermore unless the sale at foreclosure generates enough money to pay what is owed the mortgage company you will still be on the hook for the shortfall.  At the present time the real estate market is not good so I suspect that there is a substantial likelihood that the sales prices will fail to fully satisfy what is owed the lender.

The district court dismissed the suit. See: ### v. ###, ###. Supp. ### (D OR 1996).The court of appeals reversed and remanded. The court rejected the claim by jail officials that the RFRA was unconstitutional.

I just wanted to post something before your inquiry dropped off the site without a response.  I am not familiar with the 9th Circuit case from 1###7, which I believe relates to a statute ruled unconstitutional at the federal level.  I would only point out that much has changed in the past decades, and that Missouri is not in the 9th Circuit (as I'm sure you're already aware).  I haven't been in a prisoner phone area in many years, but I believe there are still signs posted that all calls are being monitored and recorded. I also note that TERM00###33 law was not enacted until ###.  Until the issue you raise is litigated in 8th Circuit (or perhaps U. S. Supreme Court), there is not going to be a definitive answer.  Unfortunately this site is not for extensive legal research.  It is for relatively simple civil law questions about specific individual situations.From a practical standpoint I would suggest an inmate wishing confession hold off until at least after the trial, and then only under secure circumstances.  ### would be well-advised give ### warnings.  I'm not sure why confession would be so extremely urgent that it could not wait until a later time.  I can see where visiting ### could be involved in passing information to and from inmates, both from the outside and from other inmates they have visited.  I'm not saying this is the reason for your inquiry, but from the ### or prison's perspective, I can understand a reasonable governmental need to to monitor conversations.  Questions related to criminal cases are not permitted on this site.  In addition questions on behalf of another person are not permitted.  We're potentially already over the line on both of these. If your inquiry relates to challenging the admissibility of statements obtained from a ### visit, this would be an issue for the defendant's attorney in the criminal case to address.  The scope of this forum is limited to specific individual civil law questions,I'm sorry I cannot be of more assistance, but you would need to retain private counsel for in depth research or of course, the ACLU.Best wishes.43492.1777777778 Ma'am:   First, please click here & read this ### is ###   ###So, I suggest that you call the office of ### ### with the ACLU at American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri### City Office### ### Street, Suite ###, ### City, MO ###St. ### Office###., Suite ###, St. ###, MO ###Intake Line: ###Administrative Lines: ### in St. ###### in ### City43480.0777777778 My fiancee is an inmate of the ### Co.

You're going to need to retain an attorney, who can then obtain your medical records and have them evaluated by a medical expert's evaluation.  An attorney on this forum cannot determine if you have a viable claim or not.However my amateur internet search indicates there are possible medical complications involved when anesthesia is administered to meth users.  It might be the second hospital which risked malpractice. If you wish to have your case evaluated, you're going to probably need to pay the costs of having your records evaluated.  However you may have difficulty finding an attorney willing to represent you.  Best wishes.MISSOURI BAR ATTORNEY SEARCH FUNCTION:  ###43486.6479166667 Thank you for the response.

Defamation cases are tough in Missouri because the plaintiff must prove that the defamatory statement actually damaged the plaintiff, i.e., caused the plaintiff to suffer monetary harm.  43488.24375 I was working for an agency that supported individuals with disabilities for ###. I quit my job in October (2018) due to my own personal reasons. While working, I became friends with an individual that the agency supported. He is his own guardian but he is non verbal and physically disable. He depends on his staff for total care. Since quitting, there have been rumors and pictures going around regarding me and this individual. His mother has blocked me from communicating with him on his iPad and me from being able to see him. She has told him if he talks to me or sees me she will call the police. She has contacted the police and tried to get a restraining order, however, they can't locate me because I'm homeless. Someone trying to deliver the papers called me to warn me. I have not done anything to hurt or harm anyone. The individual is being told what he can and can't do. I want to know what I can do to help him. He has indicated to me several times he was unhappy. I tried to do everything in my power to help but now I'm running out of options. I have contacted the Department of Mental Health but they informed me since the mom and the agency doesn't want to talk to me there is nothing they can do. My thing is the only person they should be concerned about is the individual. Why does the mother and the agency have so much control over this individuals life. It's hard for individuals with disabilities to build relationships with people that care, why would you want to continue to destroy their trust in people? 43488.9743055556 Ms. ###,Please understand that this forum is for specific civil law questions.

You'll incur a filing fee and sheriff's fees for service, which will close to equal the amount involved.

But many small claims matters are about principle and not the money involved.There are many television shows (Judge ###, The People's Court, etc.) which search small claims filings in larger cities for cases.  These are actually binding arbitrations, and the show pays any award.  Some shows advertise for cases and may not require you to have actually filed your small claims suit.

It wasn't until afterwards that I realized that because I was being investigated by the Sheriff him notifying the judge of anything regarding me qualifies as judicial misconduct and ex-parte communications.

I had no warrant or charge it wasn't mandatory and because I had already scheduled the meeting with the Sheriff personally he had no need to involve the judge. This wasnt just some "scheduling" incident. The hearing itself was strange. court didnt "start" before I was called to the bench. No formal entry "all rise.... court is now in session." No oaths administered for a purely testimonial hearing or statements like "say your name for the record" were made and upon the continuance of the case (which is unbelievably ### considering I dont even live in the State of Missouri any loger) he wrote me a schedule note from his personal "notepad" where as in my past experience other courtroom officials were active in helping litigating.

I got on the ### end of an affair with a female narcissist and her husband.  They stalked me and harassed me but when i asked them to stop via text msg they filed an  ex parte and i countered with one but the judge said mine was retaliatory and dropped mine. So without counsel and pro se i ended up consenting to the order since it was non stalking and all i had to do was not make contact. Stupid choice now i know.  My question is that ### the end of ex parte is a little ### that if checked allows the one year temporary restraining order to renew unless i request a hearing of course they will fight and for all the stress i cant see them in court again because of other legal issues.  So on ###th was when last year it was ordered and so on ###th this year i would have to request non-renewal for it to end which they could just say they are scared and the judge would renew it in my opinion. So after ###th ### ### ###th ###?  Without going back to court with them how will i know and can i do anything else or is there anything else you would recommend? I know to seek counsel and i'm just wanting to know when it will finally drop off , no to make contact that's the last thing i want, but to just know i no longer have to watch out for them coming around me.

If you have a path to residency that may be a better option. 43637.6013888889 Hello,The answer to your question depends on what the court has ordered through the order of protection, and without seeing the specific order it is hard to answer your question. The statute (### Â§ ###) requires that the respondent be served with the order for protection, and if this hasnâ€™t occurred then they are not aware of it.  For purposes of this answer, we will presume the respondent has been served with the order.Orders for protection can include different restrictions on the respondent.  Generally, an order of protection prohibits the respondent from abusing, molesting, stalking, threatening, communicating with, or against other harmful behaviors that are disturbing the peace of the petitioner. A respondentâ€™s presence might not be a violation if he/she is not disrupting your peace.The order can prohibit the respondent from entering a certain location (such as a school, place of petitionerâ€™s employment or home) or within so many feet of the Petitioner.  If the protection order bars the respondent from going near a certain place, then respondent is violating the protection order and he/she must leave.So it really depends on what the order says.In addition, keep in mind that full orders of protection are issued for a specified period of time â€“ usually a year although they may be renewed.  Respondents can request a hearing by ###.  I would advise you double check the protection order to see whether it is still valid.If you would like a clarification or more specific answer, please upload the order of protection so that I can address your question in more detail.### ######. Hearings, ### of orders, renewal, ### of orders to be given, ### of law enforcement ### entered in ###1. Not later than fifteen days after the filing of a petition that meets the requirements of section ###, a hearing shall be held unless the court deems, for good cause shown, that a continuance should be granted. At the hearing, if the petitioner has proved the allegation of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault by a preponderance of the evidence, and the respondent cannot show that his or her actions alleged to constitute abuse were otherwise justified under the law, the court shall issue a full order of protection for a period of time the court deems appropriate, except that the protective order shall be valid for at least one hundred eighty days and not more than one year. Upon motion by the petitioner, and after a hearing by the court, the full order of protection may be renewed for a period of time the court deems appropriate, except that the protective order shall be valid for at least one hundred eighty days and not more than one year from the expiration date of the originally issued full order of protection. The court may, upon finding that it is in the best interest of the parties, include a provision that any full order of protection for one year shall automatically renew unless the respondent requests a hearing by thirty days prior to the expiration of the order. If for good cause a hearing cannot be held on the motion to renew or the objection to an automatic renewal of the full order of protection prior to the expiration date of the originally issued full order of protection, an ex parte order of protection may be issued until a hearing is held on the motion. When an automatic renewal is not authorized, upon motion by the petitioner, and after a hearing by the court, the second full order of protection may be renewed for an additional period of time the court deems appropriate, except that the protective order shall be valid for at least one hundred eighty days and not more than one year. For purposes of this subsection, a finding by the court of a subsequent act of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault is not required for a renewal order of protection.2. The court shall cause a copy of the petition and notice of the date set for the hearing on such petition and any ex parte order of protection to be served upon the respondent as provided by law or by any sheriff or police officer at least three days prior to such hearing. The court shall cause a copy of any full order of protection to be served upon or mailed by certified mail to the respondent at the respondent's last known address. Notice of an ex parte or full order of protection shall be served at the earliest time, and service of such notice shall take priority over service in other actions, except those of a similar emergency nature. Failure to serve or mail a copy of the full order of protection to the respondent shall not affect the validity or enforceability of a full order of protection.3. A copy of any order of protection granted pursuant to sections 455.### 455.###. The clerk shall also issue a copy of any order of protection to the local law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining the Missouri uniform law enforcement system or any other comparable law enforcement system the same day the order is granted. The law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining ### shall, for purposes of verification, within twenty-four hours from the time the order is granted, enter information contained in the order including but not limited to any orders regarding child custody or visitation and all specifics as to times and dates of custody or visitation that are provided in the order. A notice of expiration or of termination of any order of protection or any change in child custody or visitation within that order shall be issued to the local law enforcement agency and to the law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining ### or any other comparable law enforcement system. The law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining the applicable law enforcement system shall enter such information in the system within twenty-four hours of receipt of information evidencing such expiration or termination. The information contained in an order of protection may be entered in the Missouri uniform law enforcement system or comparable law enforcement system using a direct automated data transfer from the court automated system to the law enforcement system.4. The court shall cause a copy of any objection filed by the respondent and notice of the date set for the hearing on such objection to an automatic renewal of a full order of protection for a period of one year to be personally served upon the petitioner by personal process server as provided by law or by a sheriff or police officer at least three days prior to such hearing. Such service of process shall be served at the earliest time and shall take priority over service in other actions except those of a similar emergency nature.### ######.

Mutual orders of protection are prohibited unless both parties have properly filed written petitions and proper service has been made in accordance with sections 455.### ###.3. When the court has, after a hearing for any full order of protection, issued an order of protection, it may, in addition:(1) Award custody of any minor child born to or adopted by the parties when the court has jurisdiction over such child and no prior order regarding custody is pending or has been made, and the best interests of the child require such order be issued;(2) Establish a visitation schedule that is in the best interests of the child;(3) Award child support in accordance with supreme court rule 88.### 452;(4) Award maintenance to petitioner when petitioner and respondent are lawfully married in accordance with chapter 452;(5) Order respondent to make or to continue to make rent or mortgage payments on a residence occupied by the petitioner if the respondent is found to have a duty to support the petitioner or other dependent household members;(6) Order the respondent to pay the petitioner's rent at a residence other than the one previously shared by the parties if the respondent is found to have a duty to support the petitioner and the petitioner requests alternative housing;(7) Order that the petitioner be given temporary possession of specified personal property, such as automobiles, checkbooks, keys, and other personal effects;(8) Prohibit the respondent from transferring, encumbering, or otherwise disposing of specified property mutually owned or leased by the parties;(9) Order the respondent to participate in a court-approved counseling program designed to help batterers stop violent behavior or to participate in a substance abuse treatment program;(10) Order the respondent to pay a reasonable fee for housing and other services that have been provided or that are being provided to the petitioner by a shelter for victims of domestic violence;(11) Order the respondent to pay court costs;(12) Order the respondent to pay the cost of medical treatment and services that have been provided or that are being provided to the petitioner as a result of injuries sustained to the petitioner by an act of domestic violence committed by the respondent.4. A verified petition seeking orders for maintenance, support, custody, visitation, payment of rent, payment of monetary compensation, possession of personal property, prohibiting the transfer, encumbrance, or disposal of property, or payment for services of a shelter for victims of domestic violence, shall contain allegations relating to those orders and shall pray for the orders desired.5. In making an award of custody, the court shall consider all relevant factors including the presumption that the best interests of the child will be served by placing the child in the custody and care of the ### parent, unless there is evidence that both parents have engaged in abusive behavior, in which case the court shall not consider this presumption but may appoint a guardian ad litem or a court-appointed special advocate to represent the children in accordance with chapter ### 452.6. The court shall grant to the noncustodial parent rights to visitation with any minor child born to or adopted by the parties, unless the court finds, after hearing, that visitation would endanger the child's physical health, impair the child's emotional development or would otherwise conflict with the best interests of the child, or that no visitation can be arranged which would sufficiently protect the custodial parent from further domestic violence.

I finally fire him and put the motion to set aside in ###. But from ### I was told there was no attorney of record and no address listed for the couple. The defense attorney who now had all ###.

And I would have simply gone home after my trial date. I' am still awaiting a reply if there is even going to be one. But am I correct that I was denied in Due Process. The court moved my trial date to ### of ###.43679.1743055556 You are unlikely to get anywhere in a pro se federal suit complaining about how you were treated by the state court judge and Missouri attorney general. 43679.7055555556 Youâ€™ve got way too complicated of a situation for someone to assess and answer your question and to give you meaningful advice over this forum.  You need to hire a new attorney to review all of the facts.   What matters is not whether I agree with you that your due process rights were violated but rather what options are available for you at this point and if you are in a financial position to hire counsel to represent you.  Itâ€™s frustrating when cases get continued at the last minute without one partyâ€™s consent but that happens frequently.I hope the matter gets resolved to your satisfaction.43679.5618055556 I was never served any paperwork for case number ### now ### and the court date was ### and I just read have ###'s friday I need to know what to do ASAP43679.8763888889 There is no appeal from a small claims case. Instead you have to file for a trial de ### which is effectively a do over as you start fresh which a new trial. If memory serves you must file for it within ###. 43680.10625 In addendum to the above.  Mr. ### filed three different petitions in three different courts.  All were dismissed without prejudice.  He failed to file addendums to complaints, motions against their motions, he filed improperly, missed deadlines but above all he failed to show up for hearings which was the main cause for dismissal of each of the petitions.  I know that there was a hearing scheduled about the time I had my first heart attack as I was in panic mode about it but he has never replied to any of my queries about that case. We have no records of any of these cases, know only what he was willing to divulge" although I did request him to send us copies of transcripts. I also asked him on many occasion to send us a copy of our file including research info and notes; he has never honored that request.My last conversation with Mr. ### was in August of 2018.  I was concerned about getting our $###. I tried on an almost daily basis to contact him via email and voicemail but he never returned a reply. I even attempted sending to some of his other emails I sent him several messages through facebook. We just recently sent a letter to him via certified mail to two addresses which are on court record and any search engine I found. Both are being returned undelivered "moved left no forwarding address". We know the man is still alive because he is actively posting on his personal face book page.He was not happy we sold our home but due to mine and my husband's failing health and watching the decrease of our equity in the home we built from scratch over a decade before we used up any savings we ever had were having to sell off things we spent years to obtain. We just wanted that worry over but we NEVER told him we were done. We still wanted to pursue the suit against them and we finally had a court date set up to have our complaints heard. There were still many many unanswered questions about unvalidated fees and uncorrected errors that we know were within our right to discover and have corrected. He abandoned us. He left us hanging high and dry and didn't even show up in court for hearings so all cases were dismissed and we have lost everything. Financially physically mentally. WE do not believe we would have been in todays position and would still have the home we built and loved if he had done what we asked when we hired him four years ago."43681.6333333333 Terrible situation.  Through Casenet or a visit to your local circuit you can determine what cases he filed. If you filed bankruptcy, you malpractice claim may have been property of the bankruptcy estate and should have been listed.  Iâ€™m not sure if your BK cases were dismissed. You are unlikely to find an attorney to file suit for you other than by paying on an hourly basis.  Even if you had thousands to invest in suing him, I question whether a judgment would be recoverable. You may file a bar complaint with the Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel.  At a minimum, you are entitled to your legal files. I hope this answer provides some guidance. 43682.5319444444 We hired an attorney in ###/we had just filed bankruptcy to stay auction. He said yes I can help. We will ### me $4000.00" so we did after borrowing from family members. Since then our lives have been a nightmare. We learned early not to trust phone calls because he lie or change the subject so we only ### through email in order to have written proof of our conversations. Three weeks into our partnership with him we asked how he was progressing and he said "### watching them." that was it. Three weeks later we were hit with foreclosure notices. As auction date was approaching we started begging him on an almost daily basis to please present our complaints and try to make some sort of payment arrangements. we only owed $###.###. At the last minute like ### he finally stepped n and called them on a technicality that I myself and told Him about.  ### procrastinated until the third action date was set a few weeks later.  Again he did nothing but two days before the sale date advised that perhaps we better filed another bankruptcy to stop them because they just aren't listening to him but he could not help because he knew noting about bankruptcy. so we stayed that one ourselves again.  We endured three more courthouse auction attempts to which WE had to file two more bankruptcies on our own because he still had done nothing about our complaints. By this time my husband who was already disabled had a major nervous breakdown which still requires medication and therapy Doctor said find a hobby you love. He bought a motorcycle and immediately had a major accident requiring months of physical therapy. I was caring for my handicapped mother who was dying from Alzheimers with dementia which took its toll on me. Two days after her funeral I had a major heart attack (###17) and a year to the week later I had a second major heart attack worse than the ### time hospitalized for a week. I have no health insurance. We sold our home on ### just to put an end to everything. They took ###. we had no time to dispute. Payoff was more than $###. We sold our home for a third its value and were forced to buy a home in need of a lot of TLC that is killing us.Before we sold we told him that we still wanted to pursue our complaints because it was our legal right to get our answers and disputed the $50000+ in unverified unexplained debt. At that time there were still ### ###. We have not heard from him since August of ### has ignored any type of contact has "moved" no forwarding address. He has abandoned us!"43681.2395833333 ### Missouri is where he lives. We live in ### County, ###. ### County. I know that he did not file any complaints that we asked him to file. He kept making excuses why it wasn't time to do so. We don't have any of our files. He constantly ignored my requests to forward them to us. I know that he still lives in ### because he is alive and well on Face book and posting daily but the addresses I have for him there are no longer good.  We are not the only people he has hurt.  There are dozens like us across the country. I do not know how to ask an attorney to help us sue him.  We basically want our $###.###. The monies we had to pay to the court for bond and reimbursement for all of the bankruptcy fees.  I believe the cases he was supposed to be fighting for us have reached their time limit.  If he had filed as we asked within a month or even six months of our hiring him we would have been able reach an affordable settlement and nothing that transpired since would have occurred. As it is in a two year period our debt went from $30,### $###.  Our only option was to use our home to pay off the debt.  I don't know where to ### you suggest ANY firm that might be able to help?43686.7986111111 I do not know WHERE to find an attorney who will sue another attorney.  I know that we have a viable case.  Through the past four years we spoke with several attorneys who knew of our attorney and had nothing but bad to say about him. One bankruptcy attorney told us we should find another attorney before he ruins our live but we had no money to find another attorney. Like I said have documented proof of his negligence and his failures AND his lies to us. Because he did not do his job we had to sell the home we spent more than ten years building from ground up. We used up every bit of our savings for fees and such that we should not have had to pay on our own if he had just done his job.  We had to file bankruptcy three times on our own for stays at the last minute because he missed court deadlines.  All were bankruptcies were dismissed almost immediately but we had to pay those fees and had to file those pro se because he said he didn't know anything about bankruptcies. I have suffered two heart attacks just since October of 17. My already disabled husband suffered a major nervous breakdown requiring ongoing medical care and medication to this day.  We just had to apply for food stamps for the first time in our ###. I don't want to file pro se I just need to know where to find someone who will go beyond that sentence we want to sue our lawyer".  I have considered writing to the judges of the two recent cases that were just dismissed because he failed to appear for any of the hearings.   It was my understanding that if another legal ### was aware of a lawyers misconduct it was their fiduciary duty to at least report him."43686.7020833333 I just did a search that gave me a whole list of legal malpractice attorneys.  Put the following into your web browser and you should have a long list to work from:###Good luck.43686.8347222222 If you have a viable case you should have no problem finding an attorney to represent you on a contingency fee basis (meaning no out of pocket expense).  If you are having difficulty in obtaining counsel that is a strong indication that you do not have a good case. The first thing you have to understand is that every legal malpractice case is actually two cases because you must establish and prove the case that you came to the attorney for to begin with and that the attorneyâ€™s conduct caused you to not prevail. You will have to file a petition with the court detailing the facts that show your underlying case and the attorneyâ€™s failures that caused you to lose. You will have to have an attorney to testify as an expert as to your lawyerâ€™s conduct being beneath the standard of care. You will also have to engage in written discovery (interrogatories, requests for production and requests for admission) and depositions. Lastly you will have to prepare jury instructions, questions for jury selection, opening statement, direct and cross-examination of witnesses and closing argument. It is likely that you will be presented with motions to dismiss and summary judgment before you ever get to trial. You will need to familiarize yourselves with the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure in order to comply with the timing and other procedural requirements. You will also need to familiarize yourselves with the rules of evidence or you wonâ€™t be able to get any of your evidence admitted into evidence. For example, documents will be objected to and not admitted without the proper evidentiary foundation being laid for them. Bottom line this isnâ€™t the type of thing that one can do on their own pro se. 43686.6138888889 Thank you43687.0368055556 To explain why we need to do ### takes much more than ###.  I have a ######, copies of correspondences and complaints.  There is no copy of our file because he NEVER gave us any copies of any###ng. There were four court cases, all dismissed because he failed to either file a motion , meet a deadline or just plain didn't show up.  Of the cases he filed he did not file the complaints that we wanted him to file.The last we spoke to him was twelve months ago regarding one of two open court cases. He has not appeared at hearings for either of those cases. He has ignored and not returned any of our communication attempts of any form He has moved and left no forwarding address. He has abandoned us but we know where to find him.  As we are apparently not going to have any luck finding someone to sue him on our behalf we would like to file suit against him pro se. We can prove misconduct, negligence, causation and damages. He has caused ruin to our lives from which we will never recover and he doesn't care.Can you please outline the steps I must take to sue him?43686.2402777778 While it is very difficult to get another doctor to testify against a local doctor in a malpractice case the same does not hold true with lawyers.  While only a select number of lawyers take on legal malpractice cases they have no qualms about suing an attorney that has not performed within the requisite standard.  If you have simply been asking lawyers in general if they would consider the case then it is not surprising that you have not had much luck.  As I explained, legal malpractice cases are in fact two cases in one since you have to prove that you would have won the underlying case AND you have to prove that the lawyer's actions or inactions were beneath the standard and caused you to not prevail in the underlying case.  Because of that, these cases are always difficult and you will want to seek attorneys that do a lot of legal malpractice work.  I notice that you mention something about ### Missouri which I assume is a small community.  If that is where you have been looking for an attorney (or any other smaller community) then it is understandable that you have had little success finding an attorney.  You likely will need to seek counsel in a larger metropolitan area such as ### City or St. ###.Additionally, most attorneys that would take on a legal malpractice case would do so on a contingent fee basis meaning that there would be no out of pocket expense but the attorney would get a percentage of the total recovery.  Again, as I stated at the outset, if the attorney does not feel he/she has a strong likelihood of success the attorney won't be willing to pursue it since the attorney would be ### all of the money on the case and doesn't want to pursue something that the attorney doesn't think will result in making enough to justify the risk.I suggest that you Google legal malpractice attorney" and see what you get.  Good luck.

What can I do to get my car back so I don't lose my job "43689.6895833333 ###,Thanks for posting your question.  I'm glad to try to point you in the right direction.  In such situations, usually these cases are resolved by having an attorney contact the prosecuting attorney's office and demanding return of the property.  The prosecutor will usually check to see that no charges will be filed and there is no need to continue holding the evidence.  If there is not, the items will usually be returned.  If they refuse to return the items a Replevin lawsuit will need to be filed against the police/sheriff dept., County, and maybe City holding the items.  A Replevin is a type of lawsuit where you ask that the Judge Order property to be returned.Now, the fact that the seized property is a firearm, may change things.  You may want to discuss this in detail with an attorney before you do anything.  If there is any reason that you or your husband cannot legally own or possess a firearm, asking for it back may be a claim of ownership, and may allow the prosecuting ### to then prove that it is indeed yours, and then to bring a charge against either one of you.  Be careful here . . . discuss this with a local attorney before doing anything.I wish you the best of luck with this matter.  Don't hesitate to reply to this message if you have any follow up questions.###43697.85625 My question: In ###, the ### County police had responded to  a call from a neighbor regarding my target practice .

We have a fenced (###) dog kennel coming off our back porch into the back yard, a small area big enough to park the side by side between the kennel fence and the house back door. I had a ### attack (COPD) and my husband was trying to help as he was already thru the kennel door and grabbed the leather gun carrying case to assist me thru the gate, at this time is when two uniformed County officers startled us by walking up on us in an intimate area of our backdoor. They asked to see our id, We complied, at this time my husband was on the back porch by the hot tub with one of ###. My husband had served ### Wrongful Conviction" (###) which has since been exonerated  a prior felony from 20+ years ago. The officer after running our id's stated he would have to arrest my husband  he is in poor health and the officer never saw a weapon until he inspected the ### . He stated he would still have to arrest him and would be confiscating my firearms as evidence. he only saw my husband carry the one ### the fence. we were then escorted into the house through our back door and passing by the hot tub which is where my other firearm was ### and laying they did not pay any attention to it? As a result of the stress in the situation my husband went into a seizure on the living room couch I explained to the officers that he would be very disoriented I explained my husbands medical condition he has sever back  (back is mostly fused and he has a ### ### in his neck as well as a walking boot cast on his left foot) They confiscated my weapons arrested my husband and left me standing in my yard with no receipt for the weapons they seized no paperwork on my husband they simply just told me what to look up  in the phone book and call to follow up  They did not charge my husband but said that they had to hold him for 24hrs they seized my property without leaving even a scrap of paper as a receipt for what the confiscated. I am on SSDI which barely pays our bills our truck recently broke down and I am in need of selling ### how do I get my property back?### ###"43697.7881944444 ### M. ### filed an ex-parte on me under false accusations. I left to go out of town the next day, she broke out my basement windows and got possession of my home. She gave cops a fake lease w/ her name on lease and forged my landlords name. I went to court on ###, and she didn't show up. She said her Dad died and they continued it until ###th. I went to house to try and get my work things and dogs and was arrested. I called my landlord, he said she was moving out, and when I went into the home, she robbed me for EVERYTHING I own. She also took my dog. She filed a false assault report on me ###. I have an active warrant. She put ### in my gas tank of my ###, she got me fired from my job, robbed me for everything I own, and I need help. Please. All of this is a lie and I am now homeless with no car and no job. 43699.9145833333 I am sorry youâ€™re in such a bad situation.  It sounds complicated.  First, you should find a way to hire a criminal defense attorney to handle the warrant. Itâ€™s going to cost you money.  Deal with the civil situation next. 43702.15 Canâ€™t ### county serve a search warrant with no name only states what they came for and found nothing . Also took a bomb through it in my child bedroom window got glass everywhere on her bed and room ... messed up every door in my house that wasnâ€™t locked  and 43700.5659722222 Hi ###, do you have a copy of the warrant? Thank you.43700.8708333333 I need to file a defamation suit in ### County, Missouri. Where can I find the proper paperwork to file and how can I best represent myself in se?On Monday 26 ###19, ### ### posted a false, reckless, malicious, and public photo of me with the accusation of racist" attached which collected ###+ online interactions. This resulted in real damage to my reputation and career namely the revocation of my admission to Southwest Baptist University the next day (###). I have appealed my admission with the University but they have already publicly announced my revocation of admission on their social media (minutes after doing so in fact before I filed for appeal).Every attorney in town I've contacted has conflicts with the University and no other bar association can give me the assistance of counsel. I am prepared to represent myself in se but need assistance locating the proper paperwork to file to begin the process."43705.8013888889 Like I said, I directed you to where you can find what you need to draft the necessary documents. However that will not change the fact that the statement was clearly an opinion and as such it cannot be a legal basis for a defamation claim. Iâ€™m not saying that in the past it wouldnâ€™t have been sufficient just that since the US Supreme Court ruled that opinions are protected speech and not a basis for a defamation case that it wonâ€™t fly now. However it is your time and effort to waste so knock yourself out if you want to. 43706.1166666667 The accusation of racist" was made as to my identity not just opinion about the posts. Even so it is ### false and was publicly posted recklessly and maliciously. The damages done by this false malicious claim are unjust as they have no factual basis to warrant a breach of the contract made with ###. Nothing I did or said violated any part of the Student Handbook code of conduct unless you listen to false opinions. You can look at the page yourself to see that I explicitly condemn racism. ###/ The statement was###) ### false (even if it is opinion)###) Recklessly and/or maliciously made###) Intentionally ### and###) Caused real damage to my reputation and career.This is the definition of libel and justice deserves to be done.I will take responsibility for my actions but I cannot be responsible for somebody's false opinion of my actions incurring unjust consequences.### terminated its contract with me based on false opinions and fabricated information of misconduct on my part."43705.9104166667 To begin with representing yourself is referred to as acting â€œpro seâ€ not in se. As for locating the â€œproper paperworkâ€ there arenâ€™t any forms online for filing a defamation suit. You will need to go to a law library and look for a form book. The West Publishing series commonly called the red books should have examples of petitions including one for libel. I read what I could of your attached posts and found your asserted positions interesting and well articulated.  However what you should know is that the statement referring to you as a racist - or more accurately referring to the posts as being racist - constitutes an opinion. As such, the US Supreme Court has held that it cannot be a basis for a defamation suit since opinions are protected speech under the 1st Amendment. Bottom line you asserted a ### position which led to ### revoking your college admission. You certainly can assert such a position but you and you alone bear responsibility for your ### admission being revoked. I can appreciate that it is difficult to accept that responsibility and take ownership of it but this lawsuit is not going to be resolved in your favor. 43705.83125 Again Iâ€™m sorry that you had to deal with this but I donâ€™t see how this equates to a legal case worth pursuing. While good customer service would suggest that you be given a discount or refund that is strictly a business decision - not a legal matter. Is it possible to pursue a case for discrimination? Yes, but it isnâ€™t worth doing so in relation to the cost and the limited likelihood of success. 43706.5777777778 I never once said that the owner defaced his own property.  It was how they responded to the act that is the problem.  I was told that the room was cleaned just hours before I booked it and that it wasn't like that.  That is what the maintenance man told me.  They didn't even try and suggest that we could be moved to another room.  I wasn't even able to stay in a room my girlfriend had booked for ###.  It was in permanent market. If it was cleaned just hours before I booked it and no one else had been in the room then who would you be suspicious of when there's a racist slur? 43706.2555555556 My girlfriend and I stay at the ### park inn motel in ### mo every month.  On ### my girlfriend booked a room while I ran some errands.  When I returned the first thing I saw was the racial words No ### with a ### under it. My boo had already been to the office twice but no one answered the front desk.  She had also called and noone answered.  I was so upset I couldn't stay there that night.  The next day we made the owner come and look at it.  All he said was he would have housekeeping clean it. We weren't offered any kind of discount or anything.  Where can I seek justice and compensation for this?43705.8263888889 You seem to believe that you are entitled to some kind of justice meaning Compensation from the motel for this. What you are overlooking is that the motel operator was a victim of this malicious act of defacing the wall. What basis do you have to believe that the owner defaced its own property? Iâ€™m sorry that you had to stay in a room with that offensive statement on the wall but legally you have no case. 43705.8368055556 I am currently working a petition seeking a writ of ### on the basis that the courts acted in an excess of its jurisdiction. The writ summary is done, the brief in support of is almost complete. It lacks the table of contents and index. I've even gotten the supporting documentation gathered together. What I don't have is an actual petition seeking a writ of ### to look at as an example, or the brief for that matter and I need to see one in order to ensure it is 100% so that the clerk of the court can't reject it automatically. Having issues with clerk in getting my certified legal copies an such as it is. Can u send me an actual petition seeking a writ of ### or a direct link to where I can find a petition that was filed in circuit court please. Thank very much for your assistance in this It's greatly appreciated.43708.83125 Mr. ###,This site does not permit questions relating to criminal matters.  A preliminary hearing indicates your post relates to a criminal matter.However even if it does relate to a civil case, your inquiry is beyond the scope of this forum, which is for specific questions about civil law.  It is not possible or appropriate to give advice on pro se representation in a ###.Extraordinary writ practice is a specialized area of the law.  There are no forms.  This is a complex, ### area of the law. You would be well-advised to hire an experienced local attorney for representation.  Thank you.43711.5798611111 Cuba. Immigrated in ###. Convicted in ###.

He said they left the State as soon as they filed. And he could not find any trace after that. He said they went into hiding? He told me just to send mail to there last known good location and service would be complete. I did that ### the judge still said bad service. So there is nothing that can be done ### here on out?###43725.6423611111 I have an ongoing  civil case where the Judge has let attempts of service exceed ###. I asked for 3rd party intervention or Amicus ### to help mediate the case. But I was denied by the judge. The case timed out due to no service for notice of hearing. who can provide these services in Missouri for a pro se litigant? And43724.6666666667 If you failed to achieve service, then there is nothing for a judge to do.  The judge was very patient.  Most will not allow a case to pens that long without service. Assuming the statute of limitations has not run, you can file suit once you locate the defendant. Try hiring an investigator to find the defendant. State court judges generally donâ€™t order mediation, especially with pro se parties. 43725.5083333333 My please to try to guide you in the right direction.Given the large sum that you believe is at issue, I suggest you contact some attorneys and try to find one to take over your case on a contingency basis.  Let an attorney try to find your opponent.  If the case appears strong and the defendant has ### assets (probably not) then you ought to be able to find representation.43728.575 The judge was correct.Don't take legal advice from a private investigator.  Mailing the summons is not valid service.  Unless you can locate the defendant you cannot achieve service in order to get a judgment.If the defendant moved out of state and even if you were to get a judgment, unless the defendant works for an employer who can be served in Missouri or banks at a bank that has a branch in Missouri, you won't be able to collect the judgment through a Missouri court and instead will have to pay an attorney in another state to register the judgment with a court there and then try to collect on it.  That's expensive.43725.6451388889 well I filed in ###. And I asked for a jury trial to  have them hear if he didnt cost me my employment. I found out later he was talking about me to my work.

They asked if anyone had a Tree Nut allergy, she raised her hand and said yes. They read" the label and still handed her one. It ended up being cross ### an ambulance had to be called and we had to be admitted to the hospital for ###. Should the school administration be held responsible for helping with the total cost of this ordeal?"43724.7402777778 I can appreciate your frustration under those circumstances; however, it doesn't sound like particular negligence on the school's part if they asked and looked at the label.  You said it was cross contamination and not everyone is aware that even though a product doesn't contain nuts it can be cross ### if it is processed on a line that is also used to produce items containing nuts.  Consequently, I think that the negligence it ### at best.  That said, you indicate that ### Burroughs School is the party involved and it certainly has sufficient resources to help with your out of pocket expenses.  Consequently, I don't see any reason to not approach the subject with the school administration. My suggestion would be to present the issue in a non-accusatory fashion pointing out that this issue occured while your child was in the school's care.  That this is a serious issue that many children struggle with and that the school needs to take steps to ensure that its teachers and staff are properly educated about the risks associated with such allergies.  ### that while your daughter is okay this time (albeit after significant treatment and expense) the next time it could be fatal.  In other words, if you come across as attacking the school you are likely to see it circle the ### and become very defensive but if you present it as an important health and safety issue that needs to be addressed the school is much more likely to be open ### about the issue.  Then in the course of discussion you can mention your out of pocket expense associated with the hospitalization and see what kind of contribution the school is willing to pay towards those expenses.  The school may be quite willing to pay your out of pocket expenses if you approach them with the right approach.  If you are thinking that this will be a money making proposition then I have to disappoint you.Good luck.43724.7784722222 I don't blame you - medical care is ### expensive these days.  I hope it works out for you.43724.8701388889 Thank you, I just wanted help with the cost of the hospital stay, and ambulance charges. 43724.8194444444 I was charged with a class C felony for growing marijuana I am not asking for representation for this matter my private attorney is a prosecutor in a different state that Missouri where I'm at he says it's in front of a federal judge the state of Missouri is going to break to 14th Amendment equal protection laws they are issuing a license to grow marijuana even though it's ### against the law also they're going to turn a blind eye to the ### because it is a felony still to obtain a seed or ### from within the state or outside of the state there's no provision in the law for their medical marijuana law to obtain that seed legally there for the ### have to commit a felony which is a C felony in order to grow and they're going to allow it43725.8416666667 Thank you very much I am ignorant to the law and I apologize I do not have representation I have a friend / acquaintance that I've hired in the past from a different state who is a prosecutor so when I use this quote he States Missouri is going to allow the license ### to commit a crime because there is no provision to obtain a seed or ### to start the medical marijuana he uses the ### the chicken or the ### nothing in the law provides for the ### to start the chicken he also States that if they're going to issue a license to grow marijuana that is illegal it is a 14th Amendment equal protection law and that's okay if you don't agree to it but if the state knows it's illegal and they issue a license for it and once again he's just a friend I appreciate your response please note my ignorance I'm disabled both mentally and physically Social Security disability I have no criminal history in my life43727.8611111111 You haven't asked a legal question and you state that you have legal counsel representing you so it is not clear why you are posting.  As for your commentary, I don't see how any of this relates to you since you do not have a license to be growing medical marijuana and your actions are not related to medical marijuana that was passed by the people some months ago.  You are correct that any ### of marijuana is still illegal under federal law so the ### of medical marijuana are subjecting themselves to getting pursued by the feds - just not by the state since the state has made it legal under state law.  That is not an equal protection issue for the state of Missouri as the state is treating all those similarly situated the same - not prosecuting those ### medical marijuana and prosecuting those ### marijuana not for medical use.  Now perhaps one could argue that the feds are violating the equal protection clause to the extent that they don't prosecute medical marijuana ### but I still think that falls into the category of prosecutorial discretion.43725.8715277778 The ### police called us last week saying our ### had been ### on the side of the tracks and did we want it. We had tried to sell it in ### but the guy made ###.they explained he never registered it and its legally ours if we want it. He never paid for it so Heck yeah we want it we said.

I have the phone calls recorded with the ### police and tow place to verify all this.43731.2270833333 Unfortunately there isnâ€™t much you can do as the statute addressing this is very one sided. Furthermore the longer you delay the more it will cost as you rack up storage fees for everyday it is left there. 43731.5465277778 ###:  I'm afraid you would have to be more specific for us to provide advice as to how to proceed.

My brother and his girlfriend were inside shopping and I was waiting in my car outside, I notice that a while goes by and decide to go in to check on my brother when I enter the store my brother is sitting down at the ### area and informs me that he was feeling like he may have a seizure and that he needed to sit for a ###stayed with him for a little while and then I go outside to smoke a cigarette. I return inside the store to be with my brother incase he goes into a seizure. When I go in a employee asks if I'm with them (my brother and his girlfriend) I said yes. He then informs me that security is all over them and also me because I'm with them. So I then notice that there is a group of employees watching and talking about them so I go ask what's going on they inform me that it's because he had an expensive" (like $40) bottle of alcohol in his cart. So I return to my brother who feels like he is okay to continue shopping. I let him know about the inappropriate actions of the employees so we go to talk to the group of employees that had been watching my brother and they said that they prefer that you pay at the register by the alcohol section of the store (with no signs saying this). Then a random employee comes over with my brothers phone that he had accidentally left on the table. She then reads one of his private text messages aloud. She said it wasn't illegal to go through his phone since he had left it on the table. She acted like she was trying to return it to him even though they had been watching him and knew exactly who's phone it was. When questioned about the illegal search they only replied with well would you rather the phone be stolen? Me and my brother had done nothing to give the probable cause to even think that he or we were in anyway trying to steal. At this point there is no way we are going to purchase anything from said store the workers said "thanks for not stealing" and "why buy it when you can steal it right?" Because I told them I wouldn't even consider purchasing anything from they're store after the harrassment and degrading comments. I was recording the situation and had let everyone involved know I was. I then get ahold of the corporate office for the store they launched an investigation but I never heard anything back after that. I know this couldn't have been legal and I just want to know if I have grounds for a legal case against the store."43734.725 I can appreciate that you feel you and your brother werenâ€™t treated properly from your description but you are off base in your assessment. To begin with you mention invasion of privacy but simply looking into the phone doesnâ€™t rise to the level of an invasion of privacy legally speaking. You also mention an illegal search and reference probable cause but those terms relate to the acts of government not private parties. Lastly, what are your damages? In order for any lawsuit to be worth pursuing you must have sustained some element of loss which doesnâ€™t appear to be the case here  The employeesâ€™ behavior was unquestionably rude and very likely against the storeâ€™s policies but unless it can be shown that it was discriminatory based upon one of the protected classes (race, age, sex, religion, national origin or disability) it likely isnâ€™t illegal. Iâ€™m sorry that you had to go through this but I donâ€™t think there is anything to pursue legally based upon your description. 43734.8277777778 I was only asking I'm not a lawyer so I didn't know it was only for online cases. I know slander and ### of character cases are cases that no attorney is going to take because they have a low success rate I understand that. I just feel like my rights were violated and they had to have broken some laws is what I don't understand. I'm not trying to argue with you you're the attorney. I just don't understand how the situation was legal they made me feel worthless and all I was doing was trying to be there for my brother in case he had a seizure. I believe you it just sucks that a store can gang up on us for nothing, talk down to us and just label us as ### in front of alot of people but they didn't do anything wrong and I should get over it. it's really effected me I just wanted some kind of justice but I understand that no attorney will take the case cause it's more trouble then it's worth. Thank you though. I wasn't trying to argue your opinion. I just sucks knowing there's nothing I can do about it. 43735.0361111111 Okay I understand that, what I don't understand is how it's legal for the employee to read his private message aloud for all the other workers and customers to hear. Also I don't understand how it is legal for the store employees to say things like thanks for not stealing" and "why buy it when you can steal it right" and it not be considered Defamation of character. She had said that for no reason except to make us look like bad people even though we had done nothing to get accused of stealing trying to steal or planning to steal. I don't see how it's legal to go through his text messages and read them out loud either. "43734.85 That is a subset of defamation and I've already explained to you why you can't make a case.  I'm sorry that you do not like the answer but I can't change the law.  I'm guessing that you are looking at things on the internet which is fine but you need to understand that you are going to be subject to Missouri law whereas other state's may well allow such a claim.43734.9743055556 The statements alleging that you were going to steal can certainly be a basis for a defamation claim if â€œpublishedâ€ which means said to a third-party. So if the defamatory statements were made to someone else about you (or even if said to you but heard by a third-party) then arguably you have the beginnings of a slander suit. How have you been damaged monetarily as a result of these statements? While it is true that in the past one could get damages presumed for harm to reputation that has not been the law in Missouri for over ###. The Missouri Supreme Court eliminated per se slander in the ### case. Now you must prove actual monetary damages that you sustained as a result of the slander. So what monetary losses do you have as a result of these statements having been made? If none then you have no case. As for looking at and reading the text message you need to understand that the law is based on the notion that anything is legal unless and until a law is passed making it illegal. Thereâ€™s no law that reading someone ### text messages is illegal unless it was intercepted electronically. Is it legal to hack into ### cell phone and steal the information? No. But that doesnâ€™t apply to someone simply opening the phone and reading it. 43734.9215277778 What about a false light case? Since it was In a very public location with alot of witnesses which I have on video and I let everyone know I was recording and they said it was fine on my video. I have them on video saying those comments only to to portray me and my brother in a false or misleading light. The information was offensive or embarrassing to any reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities. They said if with reckless disregard as to its ### light is meant to protect a person from the offense or embarrassment that arises from a misleading or untrue implication. A defamatory statement need only be made to one other person, but a false light disclosure must be made to a large enough group of people to be considered a 'public' disclosure.43734.9659722222 Can you apply for citizenship on your own if you have a ### card or does the person who gave you your ### card through marriage have to file?The ### card expires ###24, The American citizen spouse is wanting to file divorce.What happens if you are a ### card holder through marriage and your spouse files divorce?Can your ### card be revoked?

This forum is for asking specific civil law questions, but does not provide representation.However there are a number of suggestions I can make.  You should start by carefully organizing your documentation, obtain witness statements, notes and records of events, etc.  Create a timeline of events with as much detail as possible (dates, times, persons involved, etc.).Review the school district's policies and procedures.  These are usually contained both in hard copies distributed to ### and available online.  Become familiar with the policies and procedures which apply to your situation.Schedule a meeting between you and your son with the school counselor or principal, or both.  You and your son will want to present the details of the situation clearly and calmly in an organized fashion.  Bring enough copies of your documents to share with everyone at the meeting.  If progress is not achieved, you may need to later contact the superintendent's office and/or school board members.If the Sheriff's office has concluded its investigation and is not pursuing any charges, you may wish to contact your local ### city council members for your ###.  There is a great deal of information about how to deal with cyber bullying on this federal web site:  ###Also visit the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education â€œBullyingâ€ webpage.  Additional resources are contained on the ### page:  https://###.mo.gov/governmental-affairs/public-school-laws-missouri/bullyingAlthough it would not be at the top of the list, you could also contact your local U.

Our local sheriff's dept had a deputy do an investigation in which came back unfounded. He did not find proof that the shooting took place beyond the six witnesses that were shot at and the call to law enforcement that they were being shot at.The suspects (four out of the five or six subjects) are juveniles. They were questioned by a deputy in from of a juvenile officer and, for obvious reasons, did not admit to it. Their parents/guardians also lied for them saying they were home all night. I have picture evidence of screen shots from Snapchat that actually has one of the suspects names on the post that proves it's from him. They are cyberbullying my child as well. I can't get anyone to take this serious! These kids have pictures on Instagram and Facebook besides them telling people that they are ### themselves with the ### gang. Blue ###, guns, ### evidence proves. I need your Help!!! I'm a single mother of two kids and I'm on disability. I can't afford to hire a private investigator. If you can't help, please point me in the right direction. At this point, i will do anything.  I don't want my son shot and killed nor do I want the cyberbullying or threats to lead to suicide. I'm begging for anything at this point!!! These kids are dangerous and they attend school with my child. The cyberbullying started first and the high school principal was made aware by another student. He pulled my son aside and questioned him about it yet never contacted us (parents). These kids are still taunting and harassing my son at school since the shooting happened on ###th. Thank you, ### ###43759.8375 I hope you were able to make progress improving the situation.  Thank you.43769.7555555556 I have been served an ex parte from my ex girlfriend. I do not believe I deserved to have one filed. We broke up late September and I was trying to get in contact with her for about ###.

She finally paid me that night and about ### â€œstop harassing herâ€. I did not continue to contact her. Apparently, on ###, the next day, she filed for an ex parte on me. I was unaware of the legal action taken against me. The following week, I believe ###, I called her and she said that I was violating an order. I had not been served. I called her on her birthday ###, after I sent some gifts to her. She told me that I was avoiding being served. I went to the police station that night and asked for information but it was not helpful. As I returned to my apartment, my neighbor told me that police were just there. I then contacted the police to see what was going on and I was served with papers and a no contact order. I am seeking some legal assistance. Is there something that I can do to resolve this? I have not been a threat or harm to anyone and I do not want this on my record. Is there something that I can file or do to help this situation out? Any advice would help. I called the courthouse last week because I know I am going to be out of town for the court date and I was told that I can file something, but she was not able to specifically tell me what I could file. Please, any help is very much appreciated.43766.7180555556 Realistically you need an attorney to advise and represent you.  Unless your attorney can obtain a continuance, you need to be at court to testify.  In order to give your attorney adequate time to prepare for trial, you need to hire him or her as soon as possible.Although the best recommendations generally come from satisfied friends or family, the Missouri Bar has an attorney search function here:  ###Representing yourself is not advisable, and may lead to a very unsatisfactory result.

I was not home at the time. My neighbors made false and untrue defamatory statements to my nephew about me. They stated that I was using methamphetamine. Since then I have not spoken a single word to either of them and did not respond their texts pretending they didnt know what was wrong. Today my ###, and she didnt know what they had done wrong. My daughter responded that they had been talking about me behind my back. ### then sent my daughter a message saying that my nephew had told them he had found meth in my house. I knew they would try to turn it around and blame my nephew. My nephew text them to confront them but they did not respond. The statement my neighbors made about me to my nephew is completely false, untrue and was made without  having any reason to make such a statement. Never have either of them witnessed me use meth, nor have they ever seen meth in my home. Never have we even discussed meth, nor has it come up in any conversations between either of them and I. They have absolutely no reason to make such false statements about me, and absolutely no proof that would make this statement true in anyway. Them stating my nephew told then he had found meth in my house is completely and totally untrue. Not only does my nephew completely deny saying this at all, there is ###% no way meth was found or could ever be found in my home as I do not and would not ever use meth and it has not and will never be present in my home. I am very angry that ### contacted my minor child and told her that my nephew said he found meth in our house. Why would any adult tell a child such things or involve a child in  any way? My child did not need to be involved in an issue that is between adults.   She told my daughter this to defame my character to my child. Even after ### messaged my child, I still have not spoken one single word to either her or ### although I want nothing more than to go off on them for contacting my child and for what they said to my child. My question is what can I do about this matter? Can I file civil suit for defamation of character against these two? Can I send a cease and desist letter before I proceed with a civil suit? What can be done about them contacting my minor child???43780.2027777778 Ms. ###,While anyone can file a lawsuit against other persons, I doubt that this is a situation worthy of a lawsuit.  Please review the general information about this area of the law contained here:  ###Even if you have grounds for a legal action, which is questionable, you may not be able to show any financial damages.  It may not be worth the cost of a lawsuit, and you need to have a conference with a local attorney to fully review all of the facts and applicable law.  The attorney can advise you about your legal options, if any, or other possible action.As far as contacting members of your family, you probably want to terminate whatever ### or relationship you have with your neighbors.  They obviously are not welcome at your house.  In terms of sending the neighbors any written correspondence, I would suggest you discuss this with a local attorney.  It may be best that you let the attorney handle any formal correspondence.The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function here:  ###Best wishes.43780.2263888889 Hi Mr. ###, I'm sorry you're having these privacy issues. This sounds stressful and I can imagine this is effecting your sense of security and safety. I also am sorry that your local law enforcement isn't helping the problem. I think your best, and really only, course of action is to file for an order of protection. In the State of Missouri, there are two classes of people who can file for orders of protection: ### members who are victims of domestic violence, or any person who has been the victim of stalking. Stalking doesn't necessarily mean the common sense" definition you may think. Here is how stalking is defined for orders of protection (### "OOP").Stalking:When any person purposely ### in an unwanted course of conduct that causes alarm to another person or a person who resides together in the same household with the person seeking the order of protection when it is reasonable in that personâ€™s situation to have been alarmed by the conduct. As defined in the statute:a.) Alarm means to cause fear of danger of physical ###) Course of conduct means a pattern of conduct composed of two or more acts over a period of time however short that serves no legitimate purpose. Such conduct may include but is not limited to following the other person or unwanted communication or unwanted contact.You can do so in your local county courthouse with the circuit clerk. Most clerk's offices have people in the office who will be helpful in how to fill out the paperwork to make sure you are doing it correctly. You will have to have information on the individuals so that they can be served with the order of protection. Make sure you appear at any court hearings on the OOP or else the judge will typically dismiss the order. I attached a PDF to my answer it is a packet that is extremely helpful in how to file for an OOP and frequently asked questions regarding the process.I hope the OOP helps alleviate this problem. I know you've already contacted the police but I would encourage you to keep doing so and asking the police to cite these individuals for trespassing as they are breaking the law. Once an individual is on "notice" for trespass by law enforcement and continues to trespass it becomes a misdemeanor as opposed to an infraction.Good luck Mr. ###!"43791.7145833333 I have ### having a lot of trouble with my privacy being violated. There are some adult drug addicts that are constantly peeking in my windows. I am a gay man in my ###. I have called the police to try to deter them it does no good. I know some of them could be dangerous though they haven't yet tried to hurt me. What can I do? Is a restraining order the right course of action?43783.4381944444 During my probation revocation hearing the prosecution was asked if the state had any objections  on lowering my bond. Where prosecution who didn't possess my updated file, made a falsified statement saying I spent my money on marijuana & not my payments. When I have statements showing I have made all my payments. What can I do about the prosecutions misconduct in attempt to object my request? 43787.6756944444 I was diagnosed with multiple ### ###. For the past ###, I have participated in the Smithville disabled managed deer hunt. However, for the ###, even though they were not allowed to have or handle a firearm during the hunt. ###, I was told that the deer tag being held by the person assisting me could have already been filed earlier in the season. In the past, I've had my brother, or friend, join me to assist me during the hunt. Now the person must have a Missouri deer hunting license, even though they are not hunting. An out of state license for them is close to $300. I feel that this is discriminating against me due to my disability.I've emailed the Missouri department of conservation ###. I want to not only follow the law but understand the law; Possibly get the law changed so people with disabilities can participate without unnecessary and erroneous rules.I've attached a copy of the letter I received saying I was selected to participate in the ###. I'm sure I can find previous years letters.Respectfully,### Parks43961.2555555556 You havenâ€™t actually asked a question but Iâ€™ll try to respond based upon your overall post. The Missouri Department of Conservation (hereinafter â€œCDâ€) has a legitimate interest in ensuring the safety of all participants in such an event. By requiring all participants, including assistants, be ###s that increases safety concerns for all involved. There is increased risk associated with having someone without any experience as a ### assisting as such a person likely wonâ€™t appreciate safety concerns that a fellow ### would know. The only means by which the CD has for identifying those as ###s is a hunting license, hence the license requirement. Could the CD use another mechanism, such as accepting a hunting license from another state for non-resident assistants? Certainly, but the law doesnâ€™t require the CDâ€™s approach be the best. All that is required is that it be reasonably designed to address the concern at issue. You will never be able to prove that this requirement is discrimination against your disability as the deer hunt is for the disabled. You are not being treated differently than other participants in the hunt based upon your disability as all of the ###s are disabled. 43961.6840277778 As I already pointed out your address is readily available public information.  More importantly, you haven't established that you were damaged in any fashion.  It is a common ### among the public that there is easy money to be made suing businesses.  That is a ###.  You have to demonstrate that you were damaged in some fashion as a result of the offending conduct.  And finally, as I pointed out before the individual's conduct was outside the scope of his employment unless you have some basis to contend otherwise.  Was the employee there trying to repossess the vehicle due to non-payment?  If so, then it could be related to his employment but then the business would also have a legitimate business reason for engaging in the conduct - seeking to protect its property. 43812.6298611111 Can i sue the dealership for accessing my personal information and for showing up to my house uninvited and unannounced. Is this situation a part of the ### in ### law?43811.76875 I understand. So the reason this man showed up to my house was because i am friends with his ex wife, well they are still legally married but in proceeding with divorce. We went out for dinner and from the time she came to my house he was blowing up her phone. But once my boyfriend called and said her ex was ### our house and he did not know who it was at first he was in fear for the fact we have ###. Thankfully he finally got out the car and told my bf he was looking for my friend. When i told my friend he was there she immediately became hysterical and frantic and told me she would not drop me back at my house until he was gone because she said he was abusive and crazy. As far as you saying harm was not committed that is true but with all due respect you never can under estimate how people can be. All I know is my kids is there and a man who is known to be crazy and harmful came to my house uninvited and unannounced. But I do thank you for your time and response. You are appreciated. Have a blessed day:)43812.7131944444 I will do so. Happy holidays and again i appreciate your time! 43812.8340277778 Just to be clear, I'm not saying that what the guy did is appropriate nor am I saying that your friend wasn't justified in feeling scared.  What I'm saying is that you don't have a legal claim against the dealership for such behavior.  It also doesn't seem like you would have a viable claim against the individual (although your friend may well a claim depending upon the facts) because you weren't damaged.  The law requires more than a general anxiety over this guy driving around your premises.  I would strongly encourage your friend to consider reporting this ### conduct to the court by filing an ex parte.43812.7333333333 So even if he stated to me and other people around that he accessed his company database to access my information? I thought it was illegal to access client information for personal use?43811.8881944444 You do not have a claim for intrusion upon ### or any other claim at this point.  First off, your address is public information which is available to most anyone through a variety of sources.  Secondly, you do not indicate any type of damages suffered as a result.  You must be able to prove that you suffered serious harm.  Lastly, you asked if you could sue the business rather than the individual but an employer is never going to be liable for the actions of its employees which are beyond the scope and course of their employment.43811.8756944444 ###,Thanks for posting your question.  I'm glad to try to point you in the right direction.  This can be a very complex area of the law, and you really need to sit down with an attorney to have them review all of your paperwork to give you a conclusive answer.  My knee-jerk reaction is that, unfortunately, I believe you are most likely prohibited from owning a firearm.  See the following from the ATF: ###  If there was an involuntary commitment order from a Court, that most likely triggers the prohibition.  Nevertheless, I would strongly encourage you to have a local attorney review your Order and research this matter for you.  I hope this helps.43817.6618055556 I have just been told that it was apparently a safety hold." This occurred about ###.

I know that part may be irrelevant but it may help understanding what â€œtypeâ€ of person he is43846.0402777778 You confused me with the comment about being a ###. Either you are an independent contractor and receive a ###-###. Furthermore, the determination is a legal distinction based upon many factors, none of which are the intent of the parties. You mention wanting a contract.  Are you thinking that as an independent contractor you would have more legal protections? If so, you are mistaken generally. While an independent contractor agreement could contain language limiting his right to terminate the contract that typically isnâ€™t the case in a situation like this. How many employees does this business have? If itâ€™s less than five (5) then the federal and state laws prohibiting sexual harassment in the workplace donâ€™t apply. The reason being that the federal statutes define an employer as having ###-time employees and the Missouri statute defines it as five or more employees. 43846.25625 Mr. ###:   I think you may have ###.   My take is that you should not NOW be asking around about suing law enforcement.    All concentration needs to be on winning the criminal cases.....and thereafter you can do some thinking about possible lawsuits vs. the police.   Of course, there are  statutes of limitations to consider, but you would ### at least a year to file charges.   Others may see this differently.

During our practical, he answered a phone call and even asked me to get his phone as i was massaging his back , that was sitting on the desk across from us. He told me he would contact me soon as well after the interview. So a month goes by, he tells me that he is sorry but he has no time to train me and that when things settle down" that he would contact me. He lied. Considering he posted that he needed new massage therapists a few months after our interview. He lied and told me that he does not have time to train me through text. Yet He posts on the same facebook group asking for massage therapists to apply. I commented on the post and said that it was confusing and upsetting to me that he would tell me that he has no time to train me yet posts that. He responded "Im sorry  but we want someone with more experience He should have been upfront and honest with me in the first place about that instead of leading me on and telling me that he has no time to train me. Now, a month or two after that, I've decided to officially leave a review, on ###. There are two locations of his business. One in Independence, MO. One in KCMO. I've decided to leave the same negative BUT honest review on BOTH pages. including the main social media one on Facebook. He then texts me at 12:###, telling me that he is looking into defamation of character" and "harassment" with his lawyer. Because of the reviews I have placed. There were honest. There WAS NO false allegation. My opinion was truthful! I believe it was illegal what was said to me considering i am protected by the Consumer Review Fairness Act I told him I could remove the reviews and just put it behind us. He replied that he would appreciate me removing the reviews and that if it "continued" that he would continue the "legal action that is already in motion." I also live in the state of ### and he lives in Missouri and even if such a case pursued he has no jurisdiction over where I live. I believe stating my honest but negative opinion only to get threatened with "false allegations and defamation of character" is a violation of the CRFA and ### Anti SLAPP laws where I reside. Could he sue me regardless if i live in another state and he is from MO? I already filed a complaint to the FTC."43852.9361111111 Dear Ms. Baba,You appear to be mistaken in your belief that you are a consumer" in the context of the CRFA and have some protection under the act.  From the FTC web site:WHAT SPECIFIC CONDUCT IS PROHIBITED BY THE STATUTE? The Consumer Review Fairness Act makes it illegal for companies to include standardized provisions that threaten or penalize people for posting honest reviews. For example in an online transaction it would be illegal for a company to include a provision in its terms and conditions that prohibits or punishes negative reviews by customers. (The law doesnâ€™t apply to employment contracts or agreements with independent contractors however.)I would suggest you read:  https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/consumer-review-fairness-act-what-businesses-need-knowThis site is restricted to Missouri attorneys and questions regarding ### law are not appropriate.  However very generally speaking venue and jurisdiction for any lawsuit against you is proper where you live.  So a plaintiff in Missouri usually can (and sometimes is required to) sue you in ###.I would suggest that before you continue with any complaints or issues about your review posting that you hire an attorney for advice and consultation.  If you are not going to remove the posting about the business you should most definitely hire an attorney.   While I sense you feel strongly about how you were treated this may well be a matter to just put behind you and move on."43853.0548611111 I do apologize for posting in the wrong state, but since the plaintiff does reside in Missouri, I've been recommended to post it on a Missouri legal advice website. I did tell the owner that I could remove the reviews if he would like and put it behind us. He had stated that he would appreciate it and if it continued then he will continue the legal action already in motion." So that doesn't state to me that he isn't ready to drop it considering he has already put it into motion. It cannot be stopped if it is already in motion or can it be? Thank you."43853.0625 My best guess is that if there was a legal action filed then you would have heard from his attorney, and not him.  I doubt there is a legal action actually filed, but even if there is, it can be dismissed at any time.  Again, it's more likely he is just trying to get you to delete the post.  If you're so inclined, it probably would be best to remove the posting.  That is probably the last you will hear of it.Best wishes.43853.0805555556 Hello, I was recently locked up from the 13th of January through the 21st or 22nd of January in ### Behavioral Health Center against my will.

The police must have probable cause in order to take people into custody.   Sadly, things do not always work that way, however.   Below is a bunch of information on this subject. j  Best wishes,  ###Probable cause" generally refers to the requirement in criminal law that police have adequate reason to arrest someone conduct a search or seize property relating to an alleged crime. This requirement comes from the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which states that:"The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by Oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be searched."As seen in those words in order for a court to issue a warrant -- for someone's arrest or to search or seize property -- there must be probable cause. In situations where police are allowed to effect an arrest search or seizure without a warrant they also must have probable cause and it's required for prosecutors to charge a defendant with a crime as well.Warrants and Probable CauseTypically to obtain a warrant an officer will sign an affidavit stating the facts as to why there is an adequate reason to arrest someone conduct a search or seize property. Judges issue warrants if they agree based on "totality of the circumstances" that adequate cause exists.There are many instances where warrants are not required to arrest or search such as arrests for felonies witnessed in public by an officer. Here is more information on when warrants are not required.If a warrantless arrest occurs probable cause must still be shown after the fact and will be required in order to prosecute a defendant.Probable Cause for ArrestProbable cause for arrest exists when facts and circumstances within the police officer's knowledge would lead a reasonable person to believe that the suspect has committed is committing or is about to commit a crime. Probable cause must come from specific facts and circumstances rather than simply from the officer's hunch or suspicion."Detentions" short of arrest do not require probable cause. Such temporary detentions require only "reasonable suspicion." This includes car stops ### stops and detention of occupants while officers execute a search warrant. "Reasonable suspicion" means specific facts which would lead a reasonable person to believe criminal activity was at hand and further investigation was required.Detentions can ### into arrests and the point where that happens is not always clear. Often police state that they are arresting a person place him/her in physical ### or take other action crossing the line into arrest. These police actions may trigger the constitutional requirement of probable cause.Someone arrested or charged without legal cause may seek redress through a civil lawsuit for false arrest or malicious prosecution.Probable Cause to SearchProbable cause to search exists when facts and circumstances known to the officer provide the basis for a reasonable person to believe that a crime was committed at the place to be searched or that evidence of a crime exists at the location.Search warrants must specify the place to be searched as well as items to be seized.There are many instances where a search warrant is not required. Common situations in which police are allowed to search without a warrant include:when they have consent from the person in charge of the premises (although who that person is can be a tricky legal question);when conducting certain searches connected to a lawful arrest; andin emergency situations which threaten public safety or the loss of evidence.Police also do not need a warrant to search or seize contraband "in plain site" when the officer has a right to be present.Probable Cause to Seize PropertyProbable cause to seize property exists when facts and circumstances known to the officer would lead a reasonable person to believe that the item is contraband is stolen or constitutes evidence of a crime.When a search warrant is in play police generally must search only for the items described in the warrant. However any contraband or evidence of other crimes they come across may for the most part be seized as well.Should evidence prove to have resulted from an illegal search it becomes subject to the "exclusionary rule" and cannot be used against the defendant in court. After hearing arguments from the prosecuting and defense attorneys the judge decides whether evidence should be excluded.ConclusionProbable cause refers to the amount and quality of information required to arrest someone to search or seize private property in many cases or to charge someone with a crime. Legal cause to arrest search or seize property exists when facts and circumstances known to the police officer would lead a reasonable person to believe:that the person to be arrested has committed a crime;that the place to be searched was the scene of a crime;that the place to be searched contains evidence of a crime; and/orthat property to be seized is contraband stolen or constitutes evidence of a crime.Get Legal Help with Your Probable Cause QuestionsProbable cause is perhaps one of the most important concepts when it comes to criminal law. However determining whether actions by law enforcement were supported by probable cause often depends on the unique facts of your case. To learn more about probable cause or to discuss your particular case you should contact an experienced criminal defense lawyer near you.Next StepsContact a qualified criminal lawyer to make sure your rights are protected.

Since Waverly is a small town in a rural area, you would probably be better off seeking counsel in (perhaps) Kansas City.  You should review the factual basis of your issues before filing any complaints, as you may possibly aggravate the situation.That having been said, three possible complaint locations would be:1.  The local mayor and council members for the City of Waverly2.  The Missouri attorney' general's office3.  The U. S. Department of JusticeThe Missouri Bar has an attorney search function which can be utilized in searching for an appropriate attorney.  The link is here:  https://mobar.org/public/LawyerSearch.aspxI would strongly urge you to proceed cautiously, as small-town politics can be dangerous.Thank you.43910.9416666667 How do I report a police officer for misconduct , abuse of power , harassment , filing false charges .

Since you are in a living situation for alcoholism and/or addiction issues, there are going to be rules that must be followed in order to succeed in the program.  Achieving and maintaining sobriety is likely the controlling consideration.I cannot imagine that management is not already fully aware of the coronavirus situation and safety recommendations.  You should express your concerns and discuss the situation with the facility.  But Maple Street House will have the final word, and those in charge will make decisions about the rules based on the best interests of all involved in the program.  The other choice would be for you to find other living arrangements, assuming residency is not court-ordered.  You likely have a lengthy history with alcoholism and/or other addiction issues.  You'll need to make your own decision, and determine if achieving sobriety is more important than the possible COVID-###.   Unfortunately an attorney on this forum cannot help you make your decision.  But it would seem likely that working with the facility and staying in the program is in your best interests.  Thank you.43917.1736111111 Thank you for your time,volunteer's such as yourself are an asset to the community. 43917.2354166667 As I already explained, if you falsely say that you have no felony conviction and it is later discovered then you risk being not only discharged but also denied unemployment benefits.  If you choose to take a gamble on the conviction not showing up that is up to you but you should understand that there are criminal background checks and then there are criminal ### - meaning that some will reveal the conviction while others won't.43922.8375 I was convicted in a military court and served time in a military jail. The two background checks I did came back with no records of convictions. The only thing that came up was my sex offender status. If my military conviction is not coming up do I legally have to check yes when asked on an application if I have been convicted of a felony?43922.7694444444 Yes it was a felony. It is that when a background check is done it always states no record found. Only when the registry check is done is there anything found. 43922.8291666667 You need to be honest in answering such employment questions.  If the questions ask if you have a felony conviction, then you must answer yes if the military conviction amounts to a felony.  Failure to answer truthfully can lead to you being discharged and denied unemployment benefits due to the false information provided.  If the military conviction would not be considered a felony then you do not need to answer yes.  However, with no other convictions on your record, I must assume that your sex offender status was based upon the military convictions.  As I don't think sex offender status would be based upon anything less than a felony conviction I'm guessing that the military conviction amounts to a felony.43922.8243055556 Any complaints regarding the attorney should be made to the Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel, as you've already been advised.Link:  https://www.mochiefcounsel.org/ocdc.htm?id=9&cat=2Best wishes.43927.0340277778 I hired a Private Investigator (PI), to confirm financial institutions my ex used. I provided all information, to this person. I needed information. I needed this information for Court.  Ultimately, this individual quit after being paid. My question has to do with the attorney I employed.  Shortly after hiring this PI, my ex was informed by his attorney I had hired a private investigator. My ex told me his attorney was informed by my attorney.   I recently learned of this breech of trust, violation of ethics by this attorney, who I paid a significant sum of money. I had a challenge creating a harmonious working relationship w/her. she would contact me late in the evening, from an unknown number, ### me, refusing to engage in an illegal activity. She made it extremely difficult to have affable communications. I have all correspondence, recorded phone calls, to support my case. I was advised by another attorney to report her to the Ethics Committee with the MO Bar. Before doing this, I wanted to make a final inquiry. Thank you for your time & efforts. I look forward to a your response.Best Regards. 43926.9145833333 Good evening, The FAA requires most drone operators/owners to register their aircraft, and to follow laws on how the ### are used. If you notice an unmanned aircraft system (drone) being operated in a dangerous or criminal manner- including following you, the FAA asks that you report it to your local law enforcement. They can work together to find out who the drone is registered to and investigate your reports.

As I am not licensed in ### I cannot say if the law in ### is different than it is in Missouri in a fashion that would materially impact the answer to your question.Next, you are likely mistaken in your characterization that the hospital is a public facility.  Unless the Shawnee Mission Hospital is owned and operated by the city, county, or state government it is a private facility.  While there are still some public hospitals around, the overwhelming majority are privately owned and operated.  As a privately owned and operated facility, it has every right to deny you access to use its restrooms.  Even if it were a publicly owned and operated hospital, during the current COVID-###. Loved ones are not permitted to enter the hospitals even to be with a dying relative so are you really taking issue with having to go elsewhere to relieve yourself?43957.8631944444 I dropped my friend off at the emergency room entrance I then went and found a parking spot. I seen that I had a hour drive ahead of me and I couldn't hold my bladder and ### that long, so I went to go in to the hospital there was a security guard at the door. He asked if I was being seen and I said no I just dropped off my friend here and went in park and I have to go to the bathroom. I have an hour drive ahead of me. He said I could not go to the bathroom at that facility. The security officer and I then went to the emergency room desk and I asked them if I could go to the bathroom because I had an HR drive ahead of me and I couldn't hold it. The individuals ### the desk said no because I was not being seen there. As far as I knew then refusing to let someone go to the bathroom in a public facility such as a hospital is against the law. Is this true and do I have a lawsuit?43957.8256944444 : My boyfriend and I got pulled over because I wasn't wearing my seatbelt, they decided to search us and the car because the dog allerted  on the car. They called a female officer to come search me and she patted me down and then looked in my bra then down my pants and then she had me to pull my pants down and cough we were right beside highway and there was a road behind where she was standing I was between the front and back doors of her car and she stood behind me ### anyone who looks over that way could have seen me because I am taller than where the window starts but also because it was right beside the highway, do they have the right to do that?43899.8381944444 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and I am sorry that no one has yet responded to you in the almost month since you posted this.  I re-read your summary a couple times to make sure I understood the narrative, and although this might not be pleasant to read, it sounds like the officers were lawful in what they did.  The dog's alert to the car would be enough of a probable cause justification if the dog was trained properly by the police to detect narcotics and other materials (for example, dogs are also trained to sniff out fissile materials in homemade bombs), and the dog had ### alerted its officers to drugs or other illegal substances in the past.  (A civil rights litigator could of course challenge this if you wish to consider a lawsuit against the police department, but assuming that the dog had completed a certain number of hours in training for these stops, and had a reliable track record of accuracy, the police could successfully argue probable cause based on the dog's alert to them.)The second part of this concerns what happened once you were out of your car and searched.  Obviously, a woman in your position would find such a search embarrassing and infuriating in any context--but especially on the side of a road--but in a situation where the police believe based on probable cause that contraband or weapons might be on a person, this kind of search is legal, and the police are under no legal obligation to remove you to a place where you can enjoy a greater degree of privacy.  Officers do these kinds of searches to protect themselves, and to make sure they recover any contraband before the suspect or ### ### has a chance to destroy it.  I totally understand why you are upset at how you were searched, but it appears that the officers acted legally, and actually, they went above and beyond in making sure that a female cop searched you, because a male cop could have done the same thing to you that the female cop did, and still no penalties would have accrued to the police department.  As unpleasant as I know this encounter had to have been from your perspective, it sounds like they tried to follow proper procedure.However, if you believe that your constitutional rights may have been violated and you would like a more detailed legal opinion about a possible lawsuit against the police department, there is nothing wrong at all with consulting with a civil rights litigation firm.  You can probably find several firms in or near ###, ###, Guilford, ### or other counties who would be willing to consult with you by phone, Zoom or other means.  Try going to ### and using its Find a Lawyer" search tool at the near right top.  You can search in whatever North Carolina town or city you desire and search under the practice area "Civil Rights."  Develop a ### of lawyers with whom you may wish to consult and then seek out a couple for an initial ### consultation.  Some civil rights ### offer free consultations whereas others might charge between $### $###-hour consult.  Either way this would be well worth your investment of time and/or money if you believe you might have a good claim against the police.God bless you and your family as you get on the other side of spring and the current Covid-###.  I wish you and your family good health peace of mind safety and financial stability going forward.Be well."43925.1027777778 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  Your posting is very difficult to follow, mainly in terms of English syntax.  So far, you have stated nothing other than your suspicions (which might or might not be correct) that racial discrimination has occurred.  If you believe that there are concrete facts showing that your daughter was treated negatively based on her race, sex, national original, religion, disability or sexual orientation, you should follow up with a local civil rights or education lawyer.  You can go to ### and do a free search for lawyers in and near ###, under the practice areas of Education" and "Civil Rights."  See which lawyers come up in your search results and make a couple calls to see if you can get a meeting to discuss this further.Discrimination cases are very nuanced and ### and cannot be identified with any reliable precision on a website like this.  In-person discussion however will likely lead to a clear conclusion as to whether a lawyer should take action against the school program on behalf of your daughter.It sounds like your daughter is very bright and promising in her future; we need more young people like her.  I sincerely wish her much success in school extracurricular activities and personal interests.  All the best to you and your family this spring."43899.8993055556 Yes are a hardworking Latinwith a gifted daughter in the academics areasshe applied to the governorâ€™s school although she is as I mentioned academically over qualified at her high school they always choose only Caucasian decent. we have gone and ask for clearity to and all it they tell us lies and lies. This was suppose be for the best academically gifted children which my daughter is. by her hard work ### and yet this education system pick other less smarter cause of their last name and color this should is not equal as they wants us to believe there for we want to sue the education system because it is corrupt and bias. 43899.8743055556 Good afternoon, Ms. Jump:Thank you for taking the time to post on NC Free Legal Answers.  Given your daughter's age, this is a very interesting and important question, which will almost certainly require a consultation with an intellectual property or First Amendment lawyer.  Depending on what the content of the book is with respect to your daughter's name, personal attributes, health characteristics, or other highly sensitive information, you might be able to sue the author to enjoin any further publication or dissemination of the book (even if privately, and without expectation of sale or profit), but what will need to be balanced in any further legal analysis of this ###er is what First Amendment rights the author might have that would survive a lawsuit.  There are compelling concerns on both sides of this ### and your daughter's rights to protect a minor child from undue public exposure, versus the author's right to free expression under the First Amendment.I think the steps going forward from here would be to consult with a lawyer who handles intellectual property and/or First Amendment concerns, and have him/her review any correspondence you have had with the author, as well as the actual text of the book itself.  If the lawyer believes there is a factual and legal basis by which to sue the author, s/he can send the author a final cease and desist" letter threatening litigation if further public distribution of the book ensues.  This can be followed up with a lawsuit for an injunction (or money damages depending on the specific harm being alleged in the civil complaint) to the extent the defendant-author's actions may warrant.There are four (###) major privacy torts under common law two of which North Carolina appellate courts formally recognize: (###) misappropriation of one's name and likeness; (###) intrusion upon one's ### or privacy; (###) public disclosure of private facts; and (###) false light.  North Carolina appellate courts recognize (###) and (###) but not (###) and (###).  Thus your most likely theories under which to sue if that becomes necessary are misappropriation of one's name and likeness and possibly defamation although I am not quite sure of the latter just yet.The Law Office of F. ### ### in ### sometimes handles cases like this; its website is http://atty######.com/our-professionals/attorneys/###-###/Also ### ### whom I personally know is quite a talented litigator in First Amendment cases.  His link is here: https://www.lewis-roberts.com/attorneys/###hew-d-###If you contact ### let him know that ### ### personally recommended him to you.  This will likely cost you a bit of money on the front end and would be next to impossible to pursue without legal counsel.  You have raised some very legitimate issues here so I hope you can obtain resourceful counsel and do what is necessary to protect your daughter's interests.  Blessings and best wishes to you and your family this spring."43907.7555555556 My ### old daughters grandmother wrote and published a book about my child without my permission. Iâ€™m sure she had her fathers permission. I have legal primary custody of her and did now know anything about this book. 43907.7368055556 *cut myself off at the knees43918.1236111111 How would I do it myself? They had someone contact me and they said they reviewed my case but that they didn't want to discuss it further43929.0069444444 I am so sorry this happened to you.  NO one should be outed by a medical provider.  I had a similar thing happen to me hen my dentist told my son that I was getting braces, but I didn't really care that he did.  However, you have a problem.  First, in NC there is no private cause of action for violating HiPAA regulations.  But there are some torts you could claim like mental distress or privacy violations.   These claims are chancy at best and would require hiring an attorney who would probably want payment up front.  Given the uncertainty and the money needed up front, I would advise you to accept the 10K and use t to pay off your debts or go on a vacation or both. 43927.8527777778 I had an incident where I was receiving medication for depression, a condition I have due to the abusive family that I still live with, I waited until I was ###. Within the first month my Mom went into a ### to pick up her own prescription and the pharmacist, out of the blue, asked her if she wanted to pick up â€œ### Tanckâ€™sâ€ prescription of (Drug Name) Antidepressants. They avoided me for ###, I reported it to the manager of the store and he never even filed a HIPPA Violation claim like heâ€™s supposed to. If this went to court the manager and the pharmacist could be called upon to testify and Iâ€™m willing to give my testimony but I donâ€™t want to involve my family because I played off the whole incident so Iâ€™m not sure if they really know and I donâ€™t want to risk it. Theyâ€™re offering me $10,### â€œcustomer serviceâ€ but theyâ€™re not even acknowledging the state medical laws they broke but I have to give up all of my rights to pursue the matter. They have all of the power because the witnessâ€™ are their employees and any camera footage is theirs. I need the money but I feel like I could get more pretty easily by proving they violated even ###. Like the NC state law that says people have to report HIPPA violations. The people who deal with HIPPA said they couldnâ€™t prove anything because they couldnâ€™t get ahold of me (due to the restrictions I had to put on communication for my safety) but Iâ€™ve asked them to reopen the investigation (no response). What do I do? Do I take the settlement? Or find a lawyer and take it to court? Can I represent myself to save money? This event was literally the worst thing that ever happened to me and I want it to be over but I donâ€™t want to cut myself off at the legs now when Iâ€™ve already been fighting for ###.43916.8680555556 If you can do it yourself without paying an attorney then its worth a try.  It is not worth hiring a lawyer as you would need to show damages and that would be hard to do.  43928.6756944444 Thank you for your understanding and for your answer, I am curious though- I was considering pursuing financial restitution via broken state medical laws. Do you think that would work?43928.5513888889 You will have a hard time finding an attorney to take this --- there just isn't enough money involved.   I have never handled this type of case but if you can find the medical regs they will show what type of penalties are involved.  But this money will go to the government as fines, not to you as the person hurt.   I would advise you to just let it be and take care of your self in this time of Covid-19.43929.025 Hi my husband and father in law they have a court tomorrow in ### :00pm in ### NC in the immigration court house but they donâ€™t have a lawyer because the lawyer ask them for ### ### ### 43921.1006944444 ### I would like to file a report about retaliation from professors as encouraged by the ### CARES Director. This will occur after graduating in ###. My question: what is the best approach and how can I best protect myself?  It is apparent that I do not have all the information; how do I best gather that information?I am a ###. The final year of engineering includes a year long senior design project & was placed in a group with a student who developed a strange ### on me & behaved inappropriately. I requested to be moved from the group. The Professors declined and without reason became very hostile and aggressive towards me. This was bewildering as one Professor was also my advisor and he was typically a jovial, positive and professional person. The other professor was new to me, but I was later informed of his bad reputation.I experienced this at one meeting when I refused to answer u related personal questions. I replied, I dont think that is relevant right now" and "I dont know what this meeting is about anymore." He chased me down after leaving and asked if I needed him to call someone. I responded "This is ### and extremely inappropriate. I am leaving now." The next day I received a letter from CARES which reaches out to students if someone is worried about them (ie they are suicidal). After speaking with the CARES office they were perturbed by the Professors and had me file a report about them with the CARES Director.Eventually they removed me from the group in an extremely unprofessional manner. They have yelled at me infantilized me used derogatory language and I overheard them saying my previous career was a "###-nowhere nothing job." The Teaching Assistants made pointed remarks within ###. It is quite apparent that they did not maintain confidentiality.The Professors even went to the ### of Student Affairs of Engineering. He at first expressed concern about "what they told him" but became increasingly troubled by the Professor's behavior. It is from him that I learned the initial CARES report was escalated to the Behavioral Awareness Team (of which he is a member) which reviews reports when the student is considered a danger to other people on campus. He believed that the report was faked. He said that he was going to investigate and get back to me. I tried following up and he volley-balled me to my Department Head (Zoom meeting tomorrow 5/### 1-1:###).I followed up with the Director of CARES who said nothing but encouraged to report the professors for retaliation. I have records of all the meetings and saved emails. Do I compile a document with a list of chronological events a short description and put the emails in an appendix? "43955.5430555556 Good afternoon, Ms. Mezynski:Thank you so much for posting about this very important matter on NC Free Legal Answers.  This is an interesting though unfortunate situation, and I think you are right in proceeding very carefully on this by waiting until after all your formal credentials are certified by the university.  I agree with your approach to this.  After reading your detailed fact summary very carefully, I would advise your complaint having two distinct but closely related components: first, a formal letter or complaint form that details all relevant facts of what you experienced, and which you believe to be inappropriate; and second, any documentary proof of your facts, whether that be emails, texts, voice recording files stored via Google or other applications, etc.  You could then present that complaint in one full, integrated format to the agency receiving the complaint.  The best type of lawyer who could give you precise guidance in reviewing your materials and preparing the proper format in presenting them would be an employment law attorney.  Even if you were purely an undergraduate and was not technically an employee" of the university in any legal sense an employment law attorney is practiced in the kind of investigatory vetting of claims that I think this situation requires--especially when there is an ### of discrimination or retaliation by university personnel that skirts the boundaries of the law.  I strongly suggest that you reach out to Carena Lemons of ### who has handled a lot of ### discrimination-related cases against large entities.  She is deeply experienced competent professional kind and ethical.  See her contact information at the link below:https://www.thelemonslawfirm.com/copy-of-meet-our-team-1I hope this information is helpful to you in some way.  Based on what I read from your posting I think you have a meritorious complaint to file and you are going about this in a very careful measured and thoughtful way.  I congratulate you on completing your undergraduate education and hope that even during an uncertain time as the one presented to us by Covid-19 you will forge a ### path through either graduate school or work in your industry depending on what next step is right for you at this time.

To do so, you need to file the necessary adjustment of status forms with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). However, I strongly recommend that you seek the advice of an immigration attorney. There are several issues you should be aware of that an attorney could discuss fully with you and give you advice on how to handle. First, the required forms contain questions regarding your partnerâ€™s conduct that oftentimes have legal definitions not immediately apparent to a non-lawyer. Second, the new public charge rule, enacted at the end of ###20, likely applies to you and your partner, and an attorney can advise you on how this rule may impact your case. Finally, an attorney can review your paperwork to make sure that there are no issues of visa fraud caused by the fact that your partner is here on a B1/B###. You can find a list of attorneys who are members of the American Immigration Law Association in North Carolina here. https://www.aila.org/member-directory/results?State=29. Good Luck!43965.7875 Our I-###. In the I-130, it was stated that we would like to continue with conducting the next step-interview-in London, UK, as that is where my partner currently resides. Though, my partner is currently visiting me in the United States and with everything going on with Covid-19, he has been stuck here with me. We are wondering if it would be ### to change to an adjustment of status while he is still here instead of having to go back to the United Kingdom at some point? With everything going on right now in the world, who knows when he will get to go back. It is important to note that he is currently visiting the USA on a B1-B###. Therefore, which is possible and/or recommended, given our current circumstances--adjustment of status and conduct the final interview in the USA ~OR~ keep things as is, therefore conducting the final interview in the United Kingdom?What would be best/quicker?Thank you so much!43964.8826388889 ### and ###:Thank you for this posting.  I will try to answer these queries the best I can, although I warn that not every answer is neatly tailored to a law, and almost none of this has anything to do with state or federal court cases; this is almost entirely a matter of state statute, ### System Code policies, internal policies at each of the ### system institutions, or inherent authority by the Chancellor.  Not every question you pose can be neatly traced to a specific law, since chancellors and vice chancellors for student affairs have broad discretion to regulate student activities.  Before I answer specific questions you posed, be forewarned that when there is a conflict between the students and the administration over a student governance matter, the school administration will almost always win.Also, it would be helpful for you to know that I answer this post from a couple perspectives.  I was active in student governance matters as an undergraduate student at Western Carolina University, and in my first job after law school, I was an ### lawyer for the ### System President in Chapel Hill, and worked with chancellors, vice chancellors for student affairs, provosts, and ###s of students on Title IX and other matters involving student governments and honor courts at the ###.  I am quite familiar with the subject matter of your particular interest.My brief responses are as follows:(###) School administration can stipulate certain requirements as to the content of your student government constitution.  Contrary to what many people believe, the First Amendment is not absolute, and in school settings involving public universities, school administration is accorded much ### to impose regulations on all aspects of campus life (including student governance), for what it deems in its discretion to be for the overall betterment of the campus community.  There is no absolute right for students to craft constitutions without administration approval, since the student governments of the campuses are not sovereign entities, but entities within a state government system that itself is sovereign because it is rooted in both N.C.G.S. Chapter ### (Article IX, Sections ### 9).(###) Generally no, but in some instances yes, depending on what is being advocated.  I cannot answer this in a purely academic or hypothetical instance, as this would be a ### analysis on a case by case basis.(###) The Student Body President may advocate, as a member of the Board of Trustees, in any way s/he wishes, so long as s/he ### by the same guidelines that apply to all other trustees.  The ###'s authority to act within the ### structure is indeed determined by the ### Constitution as you correctly conjectured, but in all matters concerning the trustees, the Board policies apply.  The ### must conduct him/herself in BOT meetings in the same manner required of everyone else.  I seriously doubt that any ### campus would ever seriously consider dissolving ### altogether, since under statute and ###/campus policies, the ### is a vested BOT member, as you pointed out in your posting.  I see no way that a campus could just eliminate that seat since it is guaranteed by statute and system-wide policy.(###) Generally, ### has a free hand to spend the monies allotted to it from the campus/Student Affairs Division budget.  Limitations on how the money is spent would most likely be found in the ### Constitution.  If there are financial arrangements beyond what is contemplated by the ### Constitution, follow up with specifics and I will try to answer more particularly.(5) Presumably, if non-members speak out of turn during ### Senate sessions, the presiding officer of that body could politely remind the person of what the rules are, and ask such person to remain quiet or leave if the rules are repeatedly broken.  If that does not work, the ### Senate presiding officer and/or the ### should bring this to the attention of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.  So yes, non-members should not interrupt ### Senate sessions, as your posting suggests.  (For example, when I attended ### Senate sessions at ###, the VC for Student Affairs was always in attendance, but did not speak unless called upon by the presiding officer.  The same was true for our ### of Students.)(6) I am not sure about ###'s right to pick its own advisors.  If your ### Constitution does not specifically answer this question, the most likely answer is that this is within the discretion of the Division of Student Affairs.(7) ### can exercise very broad discretion over its own affairs, but like all other departments, divisions or entities within a ### System campus, it is subject to the administration's prerogatives.  Students at ### campuses have a great deal of freedom to govern themselves through ###, but the Chancellor (either acting alone or through the VC for Student Affairs) also has the right to preempt ### in a variety of instances, since the ### Board of ### and ### President ultimately hold the Chancellor responsible for campus safety, good governance, fiscal health, etc., under the ### Code.  Be well and safe during Covid-###9, and if there are any other, ### points to discuss, please feel free to follow up.  Enjoy a happy and healthy Memorial Day weekend.43974.7104166667 Dear Sir or Madam, Thank you for taking the time to read our questions â€” We are incredibly grateful for your volunteer service. We have consolidated our questions as much as possible out of consideration for your time. Background: Appalachian State Universityâ€™s Student Government Association (ASU-###) has a constitutional system that includes a judicial body with the authority to interpret governing documents and resolve disputes, as well as a well-defined appeals system. As long as judicial rulings are respected, there can be no ### or breakdown of the ###, and thus no excuse for the University to interfere. Ideally, the only actions that the university should take are to enforce judicial rulings if need be. While that has never been necessary, and likely never will be, a hypothetical in which it would be could go something like this: An official is impeached and removed for malfeasance in office, but continues to execute their former position, claiming the impeachment was an illegitimate coup. They are â€œsuedâ€ for this and the judicial body rules the impeachment was legitimate and they may no longer execute the powers of their former office. The University should then update the ### that it handles (adjusting website/office access, etc.) accordingly. While we acknowledge Student Governments do not enjoy all of the abilities of local, state, or federal governments, we know that we have certain rights and freedoms as a student organization at a public university, including but not limited to those ensured by the ###. We believe the University and/or its agents have and will infringe such rights. Our research so far has failed to answer many of our questions. We would appreciate being pointed towards laws and precedents that could answer them. Can the university require certain content in our Constitution (e.g., â€œAll statements must be approved by advisors.â€)? Do our 1st Amendment rights prohibit this?Can the university withhold funding or shut down a meeting based on the content of the advocacy of the ###?The NCGS provides that the Student Body President (###) sits on the Board of Trustees (BoT). Can the University determine how we use that voice?To this extent, what gives any individual the authority of the ###? Is it not our Constitution/Bylaws?If the university were to declare the ### â€œdissolvedâ€, what would happen to that BoT seat?What level of control over its own (student-fee-sourced, university-allocated) budget is ### entitled to?Can the ### determine how its scholarship pool is allocated?### Bylaws prohibit non-### from being recognized to speak during Senate ###. If an ### advisor interrupts meetings to intimidate ### and ### votes, he is abridging essential discourse. Is the ASU-### empowered to ask disruptive non-members (including advisors) to leave meetings?Does the ASU-### have a right to choose its advisors?Ultimately, what level of autonomy can the ### exercise over itself?Thank you,### ### & ### Schlaline###(###)-###43974.3152777778 Sorry, I forgot to enclose a link to Article ###.C.G.S. Chapter ###, which outlines campus free speech at ### campuses.  See the link below, which I hope will be informative and helpful for your purposes:https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_###/Article_36.pdfBasically, read this statute as the enabling legislation for campuses to follow in protecting free speech of students, faculty, staff and visitors to the campuses, and then dig deeper by examining what policies the ### Board of ###, and your campus Board of Trustees have promulgated in order to comply with the statutory provision offered here.  That will give you a clearer, more precise view of the ### legal and policy authorities when it comes to regulation of free speech on ### campuses.  Blessings and best wishes to you.43974.7888888889 Based off what you have stated here, you have two options. Please note this advice is based only upon the information you have provided and may not be completely accurate given facts currently unknown to me.If you plan to file your applications before ### (which is the date ###), you can use your 2016, 2017, and ###. Also note that both USCIS and US ### prefer tax transcripts to tax returns for both you and your joint sponsor. Those are accessible online at this link.If you plan to file your application after ###, or if you want to use your ### ###, you can attach an explanation explaining that while you have mailed in your ###, they have not been accepted as filed by the IRS. If you have proof of delivery and/or of mailing, you should include that as well. Then you should include a copy of your ###. Be advised that the government may issue a Request for Evidence in your case requesting the tax transcript once it is filed.I highly recommend that before doing this you speak to an immigration attorney to make sure that you have completed all of the necessary forms and submitted enough evidence to overcome a potential finding that your spouse may become a public charge. The public charge rules were revised in ###20, and the new rules can be very challenging to understand and address. You can find a list of attorneys who are members of the American Immigration Law Association in North Carolina here.43977.5625 Hello, My spouse and I are currently filling out the affidavit of support along with the I-###-864A in efforts of sponsorship. Though, there is a section that asks if I (the petitioner/sponsor) have filed my (###) most recent years of taxes along with providing a copy of my most recent tax return (###). Though, I am not sure what to ###. Obviously I filed my 2017 & ### ###. Due to COVID, the IRS centers are closed and paper filing has been temporarily suspended. So while I did send it in, it has not yet been filed actually. What should I ### on the form? That I have filed for the most recent tax year? Or No? If no, should I just provide a copy of my ###? I donâ€™t make enough annually and have a joint sponsor so really there income will be what is verified, etc. I look forward to your reply. Thank you. 43976.6354166667 Hello. My name is Perfect Cahua. My car was towed because it was sitting right next to my property but had no registration tag on it...I had no towing notice, no letter nothing...

While your post may accurate state information concerning the rude and/or condescending comments you received from this lawyer during her school visit, reviews of lawyers are intended to be by actual clients, and not persons who have interacted with the lawyer outside of the lawyer-client relationship.  Thus, in your posting such a review based on how you felt" as opposed to an actual lawyer-client relationship it is possible that a North Carolina court could find this to be defamatory if you are sued since this review would possibly unfairly imply that because this lawyer was rude to you in this educational/classroom context that actual prospective and future clients should stay away from this lawyer or at least evaluate their willingness to hire this lawyer based on your unpleasant experience.  Since your unpleasant experience had nothing to do with your being a client and because it was posted online there is potential exposure on your part to liability if the lawyer follows through on her litigation threat.  For that reason I would take this very seriously although I do not assume the authority of telling you what to do.  It is not guaranteed that the lawyer would get a judgment entered against you but that is a real possibility and even if it does not happen remember that once you are sued you will have to explain this lawsuit to every employer landlord or other party that does a background check on you since North Carolina law currently does not allow for civil lawsuits to be expunged from one's public records even if the plaintiff who sues loses or files a frivolous lawsuit without sufficient justification.  Given your aspirations as a ### person with her own aspirations of entering the legal or some other profession I do not believe the risks justify the benefits of allowing this review to remain.  However this is a cost-benefit analysis that you must make for yourself on your own terms.I am sorry that you had such an unpleasant experience with a member of our profession.  I encourage you to seriously consider taking the LSAT if you feel a serious calling to be a lawyer; I think you will find the profession to be deeply rewarding if you have a ### for the law public service and helping people with serious legal problems.  I hope that you and your parents will make it well through the pandemic--financially professionally academically emotionally spiritually and otherwise--in spite of the obvious challenges to us all.Blessings and best wishes to you in all things."44001.0013888889 Hello again, Ms. ###:I appreciate your thoughtful feedback and response.  I think you are on ### grounds in leaving the review because, again, reviews like this need to be tailored to the lawyer's professional services in the lawyer's capacity in order to be solid against a defamation suit; volunteering to speak to a class about taking the LSAT, attending law school or practicing law is not a professional service.  The lawyer's argument in a defamation case is that your review will potentially mislead clients to believe that based on your experience with her, she may not be a good lawyer to her clients.  We have no way of knowing whether the rude treatment you received is the same that her clients get, but that would be the implication.  Not every wrong or insult deserves to be, or merits, a public airing or grievance.  This is a lesson that younger people have not yet internalized, but older people typically do.  The world, unfortunately, is full of thoughtless, rude, mean and condescending people.For your own sake, I would remove the review and move on, as this is not a good reason to risk being sued.  Remember that defending yourself in a lawsuit--even if you end up being successful--is going to cost you and your family thousands of dollars.  There comes a time when one must simply ### one's skin when one is not appreciated or treated as one would like, but I also remember when I was a college student, and I myself would not have been receptive to such advice, since at your age I took everything personally, and felt that anytime I was due an apology, I had a right to be outraged and seek justice.  Abundance of outrage is a luxury that the very young can still afford.I appreciate how you feel and sincerely regret how you are treated, but one has to pick one's battles in life very carefully.  I simply do not see why the potential cost would be outweighed by the benefit here.(I am not sure why there are accusations under the university code of conduct, but doubt that any such accusations will go anywhere as long as accurately described your words and actions here, which I assume you did.)Thanks again.44001.0319444444 Hi so I am having an issue involving defamation. I currently a college student in Florida. At my college I am the President of the Pre-Law Society. I invited a lawyer to come speak to students in the club about their law school experience, lsat advice etc. When this lawyer came to the school I thought she was very rude towards me. I asked her what is some advice do you have for students who cant take a lsat course? I asked because yes my parents can afford it but it's a lot right now especially when it comes to paying for tution and other expenses. When I asked her that question she said so you're not taking an lsat course. I said no. She told me she cant see me making it into law school because I am not taking an lsat course. She also stated that if I dont pass the lsat because I'm not taking a course I would have to just give up and get a regular job. Then she insinuated that my parents were bad parents by saying if it was her child she would have gotten them an lsat course. Again a lsat course is a lot of money and my parents are paying for a lot right now. I was so upset about what she said so I wrote a review on google review under her firm about how she was rude and how I was upset about it. I wrote this review the being of LAST MONTH.About TWO WEEKS ago I got an email from my professor saying that the lawyer emailed me saying that I need to take down the review if not she would take legal action against me. I also got a threat from my professor saying that if I dont take it down I would be university charged with abuse (this is currently being investigated)I refuse to take down the review because that is my first amendment right. I did not defame her in anyway in my review I just wrote about how I felt. I am going to attach the review so you could look it over.I think its mighty suspicious how she wants to take legal action now especially since the review was written a month ago and we are in the middle of protest due to the ### ### incident. My question is should I worry about this because I felt what I wrote is my opinion and how I felt. Thank you44000.9881944444 Hi thank you for your response! So basically she provided a service and I was upset with the service she provided so I left the review. So I can leave a review about a service that I got her to provide? I'm asking because I know under the Consumer Review Fairness act its says:Consumer Review Fairness Act protects consumers' ability to share their honest opinions about a business's products, services, or conduct in any forum â€“ and that includes social media. The FTC has tips to help your company comply with the law.And I also know that Florida has the Anti Slapp law (if she files a lawsuit) And it says under that: SLAPPs (strategic lawsuits against public participation)###, bloggers, journalists, businesses, and other entities involved in speaking out on issues of concern to the public. In these suits, a plaintiff sues a speaker alleging defamation or other civil wrong not for the purpose of pursuing a case for damages but, rather, with the primary motivation to intimidate the target into silence by the sheer burden and expense of having to defend the suit. Which I think she is doing by trying to intimidate me with silence. I felt embarrassed at the meeting because I worked very hard to get where I'm at. Currently I'm studying for the lsat and I'm taking it in August. For her to say those things to me in front of the club was very degrading which is why I left a review on her site. It's okay for her to say those things to me in front of a group of people. But as soon as I leave a review its defamation?I also do not like the fact how she went to the university and she is trying to get them to charge me with the school code of conduct because I left a review on google review not her personal business site.But I want to know so those two laws above would not protect me in Florida if she files there?Thank you44001.0229166667 Thank you for your response I will consider deleting my review because no of this is worth it. :)44001.0388888889 Thank you you too!44001.0611111111 Thanks!44001.0618055556 Very good.

Two weeks prior i was at a location I was informed my ESA was able to accompany me to the hotel prior to arriving, I would only need to pay the pet deposit.  When I arrived, I took a picture in the hallway and the manager and staff began harassing me, accusing me of taking a picture of him.  This would later lead to the staff continuously locking my keys so I'd need to visit the cashier's desk. I filed a complaint with their Customer Service only for them to request that I leave the hotel ###, because my dog is aggressive." Mind you I never brought my dog around anyone intentionally so they would lock my keys forcing me to take her to the commons area/ Cashier's desk.  She never lashed out at anyone barely barked only when outside and was discriminated against in order to retaliate against me.  The company housing me moved me to the Extended Stay down the road but I was able to check in regardless of the incidents prior to.  They began locking my card forcing me to go to the office every single time I left the room.  The date of my registered checkout date arrived and the housing company was working on renewing the stay that same exact time.  The manager came to the room the first time to inform me I called and emailed the company to check on the payment he arrived ###. I informed him that the housing company would contact him and they are working on it.  ### the same guy comes back banging on the door demanding me to leave because they didn't get a call all while the phone was ### in his hand.  At that time he told me to leave and threatened to call the police on me. I emailed to company to make them aware of the threat he never came back.Two days later they fabricated a story and had the police serve me a search warrant on ###.  They told the police I was walking around with a long rifle smoking a cigarette and I was storing drugs in my room.  The police seized my firearms and released me an hour later after finding paraphernalia around ### ### ammunition a ### registered to me and a CZ Scorpion Evo registered to me.  They did site me for what they found but now i now longer have my firearms which are currently in possession of the police.  When I arrived to the court no-one could tell me where my firearms where and that there was no mention of the Search Warrant on file but the citation is.Do I have a right to sue the hotel for my troubles?  "44019.1625 My brother is currently incarcerated at the federal medical center in ###, North Carolina. He's only ### ###.### ###.He has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and they are using this diagnosis as a reason to impose a civil commitment in the federal prison system where he could remain indefinitely. My brother is a young man (###.o.) and has received a harsher sentence than someone not suffering from a serious mental illness; has improved greatly and benefitted from the right medication and treatment; and he does not belong in jail. He should be in a treatment facility instead. He was very much looking forward to being released to a treatment facility to continue his rehabilitation process and this setback is a devastating blow that we feel could negatively impact his improved mental health.  My reason in reaching out is that at this point we need a resource that is familiar with North Carolina laws and in particular the federal legal process as it pertains to challenging a civil commitment. If you have references for lawyers, mental health advocates,  etc that would be helpful I would really appreciate it.

I believe you have good reason to be concerned; what you describe here may very well be a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as well as Article I, Section ###.  I suggest two (###) avenues: first, you could contact the Iredell County Superintendent's office and make a complaint, as well as reach out to an elected member of your local school board.  Second, should this matter persist and you actually need legal representation, you could either hire a local civil litigator if you have the means to do so, or contact the ACLU of North Carolina if you cannot afford legal representation at the moment.  See the link to the ACLU NC ### website below:https://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/en/about/about-usI agree with you that this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.  Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  Have a safe, healthy, financially stable and productive summer with your family.44021.7034722222 My child attends ### Elementary and the school administration has a ### relationship with the Good News Club representatives. A couple of years ago the Good News club reps were given permission to stand in the lunch room during the lunch time and hand out candies to the children on the condition that they also took their religious pamphlet. I emailed the Principal, she apologized and reassured me. This summer we've been inundated by phone calls and emails from the school encouraging parents to sign their kids up for the Good News Club summer program. Messages were posted to ### Facebook page and the Iredell ### schools webpage. This time my husband contacted the superintendent ### ### (now former). The superintendent talked to our principal, she apologized and removed the Good News Club announcements. Our area is quite rural and very religious. We have a lot of believers who think it's their main duty to spread the message of gospel. The school administrators realise what they are doing is not exactly by the book. They are doing it anyway hoping that no one complains. What can I do to make them stop? 44021.63125 Same to you, ###!  Your kindness and courtesy are appreciated.

Based on some of these stories, I would think you have a good chance of getting a pardon, given that your convictions were so long ago and when you were a teenager.  Pay attention to the last part where they explain how someone sabotaged their chances by having a bad attitude at the hearing, not showing remorse and not having a really good answer as to why a pardon would help him.https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/20###/how-win-lose-pardon-your-crimes-south-carolina/1682867002/You might want to think of additional reasons why a pardon would help you.  This is a question the parole board will ask you.  If your only reason is to restore gun ownership rights, it might not be enough.  For example, have your convictions interfered with your ability to get a job or apartment?  How else have they interfered with you living the life you want?I honestly think that if you take the time to prepare a good application with ### letters by the right people -- and you present yourself well at the hearing -- you would have a good chance at getting the pardon.Linda44053.7256944444 ###,I will be out of town the next few days, so I'm just sending a message to make sure the ABA does not close this out for inactivity.Let me know if/when you have questions about the information I sent on ###.Have a good weekend.Thanks,Linda44064.6902777778 ###,I'm just sending a note because the ABA will close this matter out for being inactive more than ###.  It's been almost a month since I last heard from you.If you have any questions about the information I sent you, or if you would like me to look for some sample letters of support for a pardon application, let me know.  Otherwise, I will let the ABA close this out.Thanks,Linda44082.8180555556 ###,I'm just sending a note because the ABA will close this matter out for being inactive more than ###.Let me know if you have any questions about anything.Linda44073.8076388889 ###,On your question about owning a black powder pistol, it seems to fall under the definition of an antique firearm and the NC Felony Firearms Act (Â§ 14-415.1) specifically excludes antique firearms" from the ban.The statutes are attached with the relevant language highlighted.Here also is the statutory language:Â§ 14-415.1. Possession of firearms etc. by felon prohibited.(a) It shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a felony to purchase own possess or have in his custody care or control any firearm or any weapon of mass death and destruction as defined in ### 14-288.8(c). For the purposes of this section a firearm is (i) any weapon including a starter gun which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a ### by the action of an explosive or its frame or receiver or (ii) any firearm muffler or firearm ###. This section does not apply to an antique firearm as defined in ### 14-409.11.Â§ 14-409.11. "Antique firearm" defined.(a) The ### "antique firearm" means any of the following: . . . .(###)  Any ### loading rifle ### loadin###otgun or ### loading pistol which is designed to use black powder substitute and which cannot use fixed ammunition.Also if you look at the definition of "weapon of mass death and destruction as defined in ### 14-288.8(c) you will see that it also specifically excludes antique firearms" (which is defined in Â§ 14-409.11).I don't know enough about the type of pistol you are hoping to own.  Does it seem to fit the definition of an "antique firearm"?  Have you seen or read something that makes you question whether you are banned from owning a black powder pistol?  If you show it to me I can look to see where the ambiguity might be.Linda"44055.7652777778 Hello, ###,I am checking to see if you have any questions about the information I sent you, so far.  The ABA will close out this matter if it remains inactive for more than ###.I have more information to send you about North Carolina law, but I need to know what your sentence was for your convictions and how much time you served.Thanks,Linda44043.9201388889 Hello, ###,I will look more closely at the North Carolina laws to help answer your question.  I need to know more about the definition of black powder pistols and whether they are covered by the North Carolina Felony Firearms Act.  I also need to look more closely to the question about knives.Meanwhile, have you considered applying for a pardon from South Carolina?  Under North Carolina law, if you have an out-of-state felony conviction that is ### in that other state, such that it allows you to own a firearm in that state, the pardon applies in North Carolina, too.  In other words, if South Carolina pardons you for the SC felony conviction, which allows you to carry a firearm again in SC, North Carolina would recognize that pardon and allow you to carry a firearm in North Carolina.  That provides you a much simpler solution to your situation because then you don't need to worry about whether a black powder pistol is banned under NC law.I have attached some information about applying for a pardon in South Carolina, along with the South Carolina pardon application.  Take a look and see if this is something you might be eligible for.I need to explain that I am licensed in North Carolina but not South Carolina.  So, technically, I cannot advise you on South Carolina law.  But this information about South Carolina pardons is available to any person, lawyer or not, and it does not involve advice on SC law that is beyond what a non-lawyer could tell you.One final question:  What was your sentence for each of the convictions, and how much time did you serve?  That's relevant to answering your question, too.Let me know if you have any questions while I am researching the North Carolina law.Regards,Linda44034.9159722222 Hello, ###,Please see my message from ###.  The ABA will close out this matter if it remains inactive.Let me know if you have any questions about the information I sent you, so far.  As I said before, I have more information to send you about North Carolina law, but I need to know what your sentence was for your convictions and how much time you served.Thanks,Linda44053.5541666667 Hey Linda,Sorry I haven't had time for anything lately. I just recently moved and my dad had some health complications. I've been dealing with that and life in general. I'll review everything asap and get back to you. Thanks again! I appreciate you going to all this trouble!Kind regards, ### ### 44091.8423611111 Hi, ###,Thanks for the response.The lawyer that you spoke to -- was that a South Carolina lawyer?When you say it's completely unaffordable, do you mean the $###?The application also asks for three letters of reference.  Do you have three non-relative people in your life who have known you for a few years that can vouch for your character and that have some type of status in the community (e.g., employer, professor/teacher, member of the ###, business owner, etc.)?I will still look into the question about being able to carry a black powder pistol and knives, but I wanted to clarify what you told me about the SC pardon petition.Linda44053.5951388889 Hi, I was convicted of grand larceny and burglary ###. I was ###, but was charged as an adult. I've researched the laws myself and can't seem to find any definitive answers. My question is what types of weapons can I have in my possession? At home or on my person/car? Concealed or open carry?I'm mostly interested in knives and black powder pistols. Thank you for your time.Kind regards, ### ### 44022.8020833333 Hi, sorry for the late reply. I can't recall what I was sentenced to exactly, but only served six months before being released 44053.5722222222 I see.  Have you considered just risking the $###?  Unless there is some negative consequence to applying and having it rejected (like making it more difficult a second time you apply), I don't see the downside of trying, aside from losing $###.  If you decide to submit the application for a pardon, what I suggest is that the references include this information in their letters:###.  Their current profession (and past, if that's useful) and how long they've been in that profession.###.  Their relationship to you -- how they know you, how long have they known you.###.  A specific statement that they are writing in support of your application for a pardon.###.  List all the qualities they believe you possess based on their personal knowledge, including things like being honest, trustworthy, reliable, ###, peaceful, ###, productive, and anything else you can think of.  If they can describe an ### that represents your character, that would be helpful, too. 5.  If any of them has personal knowledge about your circumstances as a teenager that might have led you to commit those crimes, they can explain that, too -- along with the fact that it was a long time ago, you have grown up since then and have no other convictions since, and that those circumstances of your teen years no longer exist. 6.  If you have done any volunteer work that your reference can describe, that also would be helpful.7.  The letter should end with a statement like, I have absolutely no reservation in recommending [your full name] for a pardon from the South Carolina Court" or "I support [your name]'s application for a pardon with full confidence." Meanwhile I want to clarify the NC law on the type of firearm you are currently allowed to carry.  There may be some ambiguity on what qualifies as permissible.  I do not believe there is any prohibition against knives but I will confirm.  If there is no prohibition on knives you just need to follow the law like everyone else with respect to concealed knives (which I think is forbidden).   But I will get back to you on these questions.Linda"44053.6263888889 I've spoken with a lawyer about getting ###. However besides being completely unaffordable, from what he said, given my situation I wouldn't have a very good shot. The reasons he gave were not being married, not having kids, and not having a steady job. I'm a chef and change jobs every one to two years in order to continue learning new techniques from a variety of different chefs. The lawyer said that the courts wouldn't see it that way. He said it would look as though I live an unstable lifestyle. 44053.5756944444 No problem, ###.  I just needed to know whether to keep this open.  My schedule is quite full through the end of next week, so there's no rush from my end.  Take your time.I hope your father is doing better.Take care,Linda44091.8548611111 Thank you Linda! This is all very helpful! 44053.6361111111 This great Linda! Thank you so much!!! 44053.7791666667 When I said it was unaffordable I was referring to the $6k that I'd have to pay him. He said my chances would not be good if I attempted it on my own. He was located in South Carolina. As for the ###, yes of course, I have a surplus of people I could call on44053.6048611111 You're very welcome.I just found this link for the SC Appleseed Legal Justice Center: https://www.scjustice.org/brochure/pardons/  Have you looked into their resources?  They might have someone there willing to help you with your pardon application for free or at a very low cost.Also -- I have not read this article yet, but it looks to have promising information about pardons in SC (maybe different from what your lawyer told you):  https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/20###/south-carolina-grants-pardon-most-convicts-who-ask/1681160002/And -- if you Google how to write a pardon letter you will find articles and sample letters.  Later when I have time, I will try to find some good samples and tips to follow.Linda44053.7090277778 A divorce should not affect your immigration status as long as your marriage was bona fide when you applied for and obtained legal permanent resident status. A bona fide marriage means that you were married based on your love and affection, did not marry for the purposes of immigration.If your marriage does end, there are two important considerations related to naturalization that you should consider. First, if you divorce very quickly after receiving your immigration status, it will likely look suspicious to the officer who reviews your naturalization application. Therefore, you should be prepared to present evidence to prove that your relationship was valid when you entered into it, and throughout its entirety. Second, you will have to wait five years to ###, as you will no longer be considered the spouse of a US citizen, and therefore will not be eligible to ### after three years.Please note this advice is based only upon the information you have provided and may not be completely accurate given facts currently unknown to me. To receive full and accurate advice, you should consult an immigration attorney who can analyze the unique facts of your situation.

We used the u scan and the gentleman working the area had to come clear it out ###'t ### correctly. On the way out the door a lady and another guy approached us standing in front of our buggy demanding for us to turn around and come with them to talk about the items we had stolen!!! I was livid demanding they move out of my way since i had just spent ###!! The guy said we stole  a pack of chicken and a pack of hotdog buns!! I took them out of the buggy and tossed them on a water jug rack after telling him I would gladly pay them it was a total mistake and they refused to allow me to do so!! I told them to take their hands off my property and I proceeded to my car all the while the lady was yelling over her cell phone my description and what I was driving. The police came and we went back inside and was told that we were banned and that we would be charged for shoplifting within the next two weeks if Walmart decided to do so. I did not cooperate and speak to any of them neither did I sign or give them my social security number which the lady demanded I give her before I could leave. We have not been served with anything as of todÃ y. when I got in my driveway I was looking at my receipt only to discover I had paid for the buns and I then called the store manager .she told me to come back where she met me in the past lot advising me to make a complaint through cooperate . She took a pic of my receipt and gave me my buns. This was so embarrassing. I was detained against my will, embarrassed, harassed, and now banned for a crime I'm not guilty of!! Is there anything I can do ?! 44037.2777777778 Good Saturday evening to you, Ms. ###:Thanks for posting about this situation on NC Free Legal Answers.  This is very unfortunate indeed, although I am glad that you were eventually cleared by showing that you actually did pay for the items that you were accused of stealing.  I can only imagine how ### an ordeal this situation was for you and your boyfriend.Unless you get charged or sued, there is little to do at this point except ask that the store manager rescind its decision to ban you from the property, since you eventually was able to show proof that you did nothing wrong.  The store should reconsider its decision, admit its mistake and allow you to shop at the store when you choose, although it is not strictly required by law to do any of these things.Stores are permitted to briefly detain customers/patrons when they believe in good faith (even when they turn out to be mistaken) that items might have been shoplifted, or are in the process of being shoplifted (this is referred to as the shopkeeper's privilege").  So the fact that you were detained and questions in and of itself is not the criminal or civil fault of the store but again since the management now knows that you did not steal anything there is every reason for them to lift the ban and allow you to shop there from now on.  I hope that the manager will do this once you approach them and ask for their decision to be reversed.  If you choose to pursue this be certain that the decision comes from management so that you can be assured there will be no incident going forward on subsequent visits to the store.I wish you well during this pandemic and hope that you your boyfriend and your respective families will be safe healthy productive and financially stable despite the present challenges for our state and country.

How do we do this? 44045.1055555556 You need to meet with an immigration attorney. While US Citizens can petition for their spouses, immigration law is incredibly complex, and it is impossible to give you precise, accurate advice without doing a full interview with you and your husband. For example, as someone who entered the United States illegally, your husband has accrued unlawful presence in the United States. This likely means that he will have to process his case outside the country but leaving the US will likely trigger a ten-year bar, which means he will need a waiver to return. This is an incredibly complex area of the law, so you should seek advice from an immigration attorney to learn more and develop a case strategy for you and your spouse.

The exception to this is if you receive your ### card based off marriage to a US Citizen; if that is the case, you can apply for naturalization after three years. However, before applying for naturalization, you should seek the advice of an immigration attorney to make sure you are otherwise eligible, as there are several legal requirements in addition to the 5/###.As far as the public charge rule is concerned, you and your family are unlikely to be considered a public charge. The public charge rule enacted in ### â€œadmission.â€ As a legal permanent resident, you have already been admitted to the United States (aka you have been allowed to enter as an immigrant), and therefore the rule does not apply to you. The exception to this is if youâ€™re legal permanent resident and have been out of the country for six months or more, you are considered an applicant for admission once again, and then the public charge rule would apply.In other words, as long as you do not intend to leave the country for six months or more, the public charge rule will not apply to you. Therefore, you can apply for any public assistance program you or your children are eligible for.For a more detailed analysis, I highly recommend you speak to an immigration attorney so you can receive a full evaluation of your individual facts.You can find a list of attorneys who are members of the American Immigration Law Association in North Carolina here.

I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing such a rough situation with the local bail bondsman company. Unfortunately, bail bonds companies do have some ability to enter a home and to use reasonable force" to apprehend someone they are looking for. However they must believe that that person lives in the home they are entering. From what you have shared it does not sound like that is the case here. Do you know the person that they are looking for and whether he/she has ever lived at the place where you are living now? Of course their powers are not completely unchecked and you have two options for reporting them: (1) pursue criminal charges against the officers; and (2) file a complaint with the NC Department of Insurance which is the state agency that oversees bail companies. For either option it will be important to have as much documentation as possible. I would suggest writing down if you haven't already a clear timeline of everything that has happened so far including dates and times wherever possible. If you have them it will be important to also have any names of individual officers and the company ready to share. Take photos of any damage and save any recordings/videos you have made of interactions with the bail bondsmen. Write a short description of how everything has impacted you and your children. Once you have your thoughts and evidence organized and ready you can call the sheriff to file a report if you feel comfortable doing so. You can request a copy of the incident report after they come to your home if you would like a copy of what they write up about their visit to your home. I would suggest also writing down the names of the officers you speak with so you have them if you need them later. If the sheriff refuses to take a report for any reason you still have the option of pursuing a criminal charge with the magistrate. You will have to go in person to the magistrate's office. Again it will be important to take them all of the information and evidence you have available. The second option is to file an official complaint with the NC Department of Insurance (NCDOI). You can file a complaint with the NCDOI in addition to or instead of the criminal complaint. They are the agency who monitors bail bond companies and can penalize them or take their licenses away if they are violating regulations. You can call the Bail Bond Regulatory Division at 919-### or you can submit an online complaint form here: https://www.ncdoi.gov/bbrd-online-complaint-formAgain for both reports it will be important for each time the bail bondsmen came to your house to try to have as much of the following information as possible:-Date -Time-Name(s) of officer(s) and/or name of bail bond company-Anything that was said about why they were at the house who they were looking for etc.-What damage they caused-How it has affected you and your children For any incident where they did not come to your house but you believe them to be involved you will want to explain why you think they were involved. For example you mentioned that they turned off your power. If you spoke with your power company and your power company told you it was them who shut off everything tell the sheriff/magistrate/NCDOI that fact.I hope this helps and that the whole situation stops for you very quickly."44060.7861111111 On ###st at 12-###. It was some man I did not know he lied multiple times about who he was so I did not feel comfortable opening the door to him. He reveals himself as a bounty ### or ### officer something like that. I still didn't believe him at this point so I called the police it was just me and my ###. Now these bounty ###s came back to my home for the next two days non stop after I already told them the person they were looking for was not here. It is my fourth amendment right to refuse to let them in my home without a warrant. Esp if my name is the only one on the lease. Now they harassed me, broke into my home through the window, invaded my home, caused a disturbance at my place if living which is now causing me my place to live and put my children at risk by turning my power off ? They came in illegally and the person they wanted didn't even have a warrant??? So I am wondering what my options are please idk how to go about taking paperwork out . 44056.8020833333 Hello, I was eligible to apply for DACA in ### ### 2007. In 2018, I had to drop out of my senior year due to me getting pregnant and being kicked out my house but I'm enrolling next week to finish school because I'm living with my parents as a single mom and my child is a month old due to having a miscarriage and getting pregnant again. What can I do about my immigration status? 44058.8972222222 Hi Ms. ###,Thank you for submitting a question to North ### Free Legal Answers program. I am sorry that you went through that denial with your earlier DACA application. As I'm sure you know, right now the state of the DACA program is very ###. Although a recent decision by the US Supreme Court found that Trump could not end the DACA program in the way that he tried to, USCIS since announced that they will not be accepting initial applications. USCIS says that they are currently reviewing the program and they will reject any initial filings. Some attorneys and nonprofit organizations are considering suing USCIS to force them to accept the applications but, right now, it is likely that if you send in a new application, they will reject it. If USCIS begins to accept new applications and does not change anything about who is eligible, you can still apply for DACA even though your past application was rejected. To be eligible, the following must be true:-You were under ### ###; -You came to the US before you were ###;-You have lived in the US continuously since at least ###;-You were living in the United States on ### and on the day when you apply for DACA; -You did not have any lawful immigration status on ###;-You are currently in school, graduated or got a certificate of completion from high school, got a GED certificate, or were ### discharged from the military and-You do not have a significant criminal history (no felony convictions, signficant misdemeanor convictions, or ###) and don't pose a threat to the safety or national security of the US.It can be very challenging but, if you apply, you will need to be able to show USCIS that you meet each of these requirements. Ideally, you would be able to show some sort of documentation for each requirement. For example, to show you have lived in the United States continuously since ### of 2007, it can be helpful to show some sort of paper from every month or every few months from then on. These can be medical records, bills, mail, records from school, letters from those who know you and can explain how they know you've been in the United States, photographs showing you in the US that have the date on them, etc. Because this can be so complicated and because things with DACA have been changing so frequently, it would be best if you could meet with an attorney who could assist you in your application. It would also be helpful if that attorney could do a full assessment of your immigration history and family circumstances to see if there is anything else you can qualify for. I know that getting legal assistance can be expensive and it can be hard to know where to find help. If cost is an issue for you, you may want to seek help from a nonprofit. I see you are in ### County. You may want to reach out to Catholic Charities to discuss their low-cost immigration services program. They have an office in ### that may be easier for you to get to. You can find more information about their program here - https://www.catholiccharities###.org/immigration/If you can make it to ###, you could also contact the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants in ### to ask whether they are currently assisting with DACA applications. You can call them at ###-###. A new low cost legal services office is opening in ### called Justice for Our Neighbors. You can find out more about them and how to contact them here - https://www.###jfon.org/servicesI hope this helps. Again, because the state of the program is changing so quickly, I would highly recommend both meeting with an attorney and keeping an eye on the news for any relevant updates and changes. 44060.76875 I just heard from DSs today that their assessment stating my fiancÃ© can never be around my son still stands even if I don't sign. They have no just cause for keeping him away from my son. He is a ### registered sex offender who is not on probation and who is not prevented from having contact or even living with minors. He has completed all assements and classes set forth by the state of North Carolina and has been deemed safe to be around minors. How can they do this to my family? What is my recourse.44088.9104166667 My civil right of mental integrity is being violated by DSS. My fiancÃ© is a ### registered sex offender and I have a ### old son. He has no stipulations about being around minors. My worker is attempting to brainwash me into thinking he is a bad person. She has aggressively attacked my thought process and questioned my mental health. She has even e-mailed me media about his trial in attempt to change my opinion of him. They threatened to remove my child from the home (police were present) until my son could be interviewed and examined unless my fiancÃ© and I signed a 'safety assement' banning him from my son and the home until the interview. We signed, he was escorted off the property. The interview and exam were completed and NO signs of abuse were present. My worker came to my home the next day with a new assement barring my fiancÃ© any contact with my son forever. I refused to sign. I now fear they will attempt to remove my child from my care. They have until the 29th of this month to complete their investigation...what is my recourse?44084.8402777778 He will argue that there was no invasion of privacy since your daughter was showing the inside of the home voluntarily to him.You will need to emphasize that he directed your daughter what to do. As a minor, she could not have given valid consent or fully appreciated what was happening. So I still believe you have a claim for invasion of privacy as stated above.44106.5097222222 It appears that you and your fiance would have a civil claim for invasion of privacy by intrusion into ###, which is a recognized tort in North Carolina. I am pasting a link to the North Carolina pattern jury instructions for invasion of privacy. At a trial, this is what the jury would be read before rendering a verdict.https://www.sog.unc.edu/sites/www.sog.unc.edu/files/pji-master/civil/c800.70.pdfAs you can see from the jury instructions, this claim includes the intentional intrusion into the ### or ### of another person or their private affairs or concerns, where a reasonable person would find the intrusion highly offensive. This reasonable person" language is broad and means that in order to have a viable claim a reasonable person would have to find the action highly offensive.Furthermore the intrusion does not have to be a physical intrusion â€“ here the intrusion was the use of an electronic device to surveil your home. You would certainly expect to have privacy inside your home and a reasonable person would find it highly offensive if someone else directed a child to be the unwitting participant in a scheme to photograph the contents of your home. The other side will likely argue that they did not intrude since it was the daughter who took the pictures. But if it can be shown that the ex husband was directing the child I don't think this defense would work.Here is a link to a helpful publication regarding North ### privacy laws including criminal statutes (which I don't think apply here).https://www.ncleg.gov/documentsites/committees/BCCI-6624/2014-1-21%20Meeting/Potentially%20Relevant%20Current%20NC%20Laws/Powerpoint%20Current%20NC%20Laws.pdfI do not think the ### statute would apply since the pictures are not of another person in your room but instead just focused on the contents of your room. See N.C.G.S. ###. I also do not think that Chapter ###-###.In sum you and your fiance have a civil claim for invasion of privacy. Your fiance should apprise her attorney in the custody battle (if she has one) of the same. If she does not have an attorney she should give the court her evidence and a copy of the pattern jury instructions. You and your fiance should also consider filing a separate civil lawsuit for invasion of privacy. "44103.7965277778 My fiance and her ex husband are going through a second custody battle. We found out through a Guardian Ad Litem and her attorney yesterday that he has pictures of inside our home. He has been using a video conference app with her ###. He had her take pictures of the location of my large safe and inside showing its contents. Is this a crime and can I sue for this? We have some of the screenshots that (he took from his device) and they show him in them. 44089.8 Well you see she didnt take the pictures. He took them from his device while on the chat with her. Its not like she took them at all! He instructed her to do it and he took screenshots as she went. 44106.4916666667 Good afternoon, Ms. Spaide:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  I recommend that you seek a ### ### consultation (probably a half hour will do, either by phone or remotely using a web-conference tool) with a disability discrimination lawyer in or near Union County.  While I do not believe that the facts you stated here amount to a strong discrimination case, it is possible that a lawyer with whom you speak on a more lengthy basis will see things that I do not, based on a brief description posted here.  I see nothing discriminatory in what you wrote, at least not in a legal sense of the ###.Search online for lawyers who handle disability discrimination cases, and when you have at least three or four who look like reputable prospects, reach out to them and see if you can consult with them for either a half hour or a whole hour.  While some lawyers may offer you a free consultation, be prepared to pay a small fee for a consultation if you want quality and thorough advice.Blessings to you and your family during the pandemic, and I wish you well this fall and winter.44103.8416666667 Itâ€™s my understanding the statute of limitations to file a discrimination suit is ###. There was an incident that occurred last year, ###, at Walmart and I was asked to show them my disability papers for my service dog and I told them no so they told me to leave the store because I had my service dog with me and they sell food. I left the store but came back in through the front Doors to talk to the manager and the greeter told me I needed to wait outside since I had my dog.44103.5444444444 Hello I just wanted to know if an officer comes to my door asking for ### name besides mine without a warrant do I personally have to provide them with their name when they have the opportunity to ask that person themselves because they were standing right there . I provided my information and was given obstruction of justice for not giving the persons name. I didnâ€™t know I could get into trouble for not giving a persons name when I wasnâ€™t detained or anything.44103.6326388889 I need a lawyer who can appeal my case to the NC Supreme Court. According to my former court-appointed attorney who filed my earlier appeal to a lower court and which got rejected by that court, I now have until ### to file either a notice of appeal, or a petition for discretionary review, or a petition for writ of certiorari.I have no idea how to do any of this and I need a lawyer who can do this on my behalf. I am currently living on SSD and cannot afford to hire an attorney to do this.The stakes for me are fairly high. The underlying issue involves a video recording I made while walking around on the campus of my former employer during lunch hour back in 2017. The company has ### in compelling me to give them the video portion of that recording, but now they are attempting to obtain the audio portion, which I have so far refused to give them because the US Constitution is supposed to protect my right against self-incrimination.As a result of my civil disobedience, I was held in Civil Contempt and have spent ###. Since then, I have been out of jail pending that appeal, but then it finally got rejected last August. Now I have until ### to appeal to the NC Supreme Court, or I will be compelled to hand over the audio or go to jail until I do hand it over.I am in way over my head here and I need legal counsel but cannot afford to pay for it. I have contacted Legal Aid, but they don't handle this sort of case. I have also contacted Disability Rights of North Carolina (because I have a disability and all of this started when I tried to ask my employer for reasonable accommodation and got subsequently fired) but they have not yet responded. I have always heard about lawyers who take cases pro bono" but so far this appears to be some sort of myth.I find it impossible to believe that I have a right to appeal but cannot actually exercise that right simply because I'm poor. Surely there must be some way for me to obtain legal counsel.Please advise### L. Scholten"44111.6944444444 I'm a career ### operator the past ###.

People starting fights with police waiting down the street for me to react, entrapment attempts because when weighing the options of hanging myself or doing drugs I opted for the latter but the rope is still next to the tree. The only time anyone has spoken to me at all is to gain information or use it against me so I try to avoid talking and looking at anyone, pictures altered on google photos, there's a lot more. I have been forced to represent myself and now that I should have a default judgment in my favor I'm being told both parties need to give the judge permission to enter a default judgment. I have most of this evidence in writing not only do I need to know how to get justice I also want this problem corrected I'm grateful for the hardship if it's an engine for the correction of the oppression inflicted upon the other people seeking justice and I believe this case can.

You can ask your releasing officer for your Certificate of Restoration of Forfeited Rights of Citizenship. This is not required to register to vote but will prove your eligibility to vote if someone challenges your registration. If you have been discharged from probation you are eligible to register and vote even if you still owe money or have a civil lien."Voter Registration: If you want to vote in this upcoming election and have not yet registered it looks like your ONLY option is to vote IN PERSON during EARLY VOTING which runs now through ###.

He has recently walked in court and ### lies, which i am able to prove also numerous domestic violence issues. the judge had no reason to make my visits supervised.   I need any assistance to help me resolve this issue44120.7923611111 I am afraid it is impossible to answer all of your questions.  We have no facts of the case and no way to determine if it has merit.  I can, however, answer your generic questions.  Yes, you may always utilize the courts pro se.  Please remember that, if you choose to act as your own attorney, you will be treated like an attorney.  No one is going to teach you how to file your case, serve the Defendants, submit requests for Discovery, respond to requests for Discovery, conduct Depositions, conduct scheduling Hearings, prepare Motions in Limine to keep documents or testimony out - or get it in, prepare Exhibits and prepare the foundation for entry into evidence, how to direct examine a witness, cross examine a witness, impeach a witness, object to questions and follow up with civil procedure arguments, participate in Mediation or Arbitration, prepare opening and closing arguments, or prepare Settlement Agreements.  In most cases, the Judge is quite patient with pro se litigants unless and until you begin making the same mistakes over and over.  I mean no disrespect to you or your claim.  I understand you do not believe it is frivolous and I have no evidence that it is.  However, just as an observation - there are many hungry lawyers out there eager to take quality cases they believe they can win.  If attorneys are turning this case down it could possibly be a sign that they do not believe it is a winnable case.  You are talking about a complex litigation case that could stretch out for many, many months.  It is also a sign to the attorney that, if you cannot afford a complex litigation consultation fee, then you definitely cannot afford to hire them to pursue your case.  Another issue is that you may very well have a winnable case, but the amount you would probably win is less than the legal fees it would take to win the case.  I really wish I had better news for you.  I trust you have Googled Title VII claims, as many attorneys put information on their websites with checklists to determine if you have a valid claim.  Maybe this would help a little.  I wish you great luck.  44132.6743055556 Is it suitable to proceed to file a wrongful termination claim violating Title ###, especially if I demonstrate, if the issue is raised, that I have not been able to find an attorney or have been turned down or requested to pay high consultation fees. How do I show the court that I am fit to proceed, but also respect the court, so the court will not take me wrong. Just trying to be modest. What elements must I prove, and how do I not lose by civil procedure? How do I seal a settlement without the case being heard? Or if it is, how will the judge take me? Nothing is frivolous about my complaint, how do I avoid paying other party lawyer fees by losing. 44132.1659722222 My brother was pulled over & was told it was due to speeding. He complied with the officers request for his info but when officer returned to the vehicle, she said they smelled marijuana & to step out of the car.

So, if a driver was speeding (even ###) the officer likely has probable cause to initiate a traffic stop.  If at the stop, an officer ### marijuana present, the officer likely can search the vehicle without the driver's consent.

While none of the comments you proposed constitute defamation, if you protest on Jiffy ### property, you can be criminally ###.  If you are going to do this, make sure that you are on a public sidewalk or otherwise on public property.  If you are on private property, the commercial owner or tenant of such (whether it is a ###, parking lot, adjoining sidewalk, etc.) can ask that you leave in order to have a less disruptive business environment, and if you do not relent, they can and likely will call the police.Just for your information, defamation requires (###) a concrete statement of fact, (###) of and concerning the plaintiff, (###) written or spoke to a third party, (###) that damages the plaintiff's reputation/standing in the community, or causes economic loss.  If what you express is mere opinion rather than fact, it is not defamatory.  Nonetheless, please tread carefully and consider this decision before acting.  There are other ways to express your dissatisfaction, including online.Best wishes to you this winter.44145.65 Hi, I want to protest outside Jiffy Lube with a sign for taking advantage of me with poor service and not allowing for me to get a refund.

This process is detailed on the USCIS website here: https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment/changing-to-a-nonimmigrant-f-or-m-student-status.Changing your status from a visitor visa to a student visa is a complicated process, so I highly recommend you consult an immigration attorney who can help make sure you file the application correctly, and maintain lawful status while you wait to obtain your student visa. You can find a list of attorneys who are members of the American Immigration Law Association in North Carolina here. There are also several nonprofits in North Carolina that can assist immigrants for low or no cost, such as Legal Services of the Southern Piedmont and Pisgah Legal Services.

My brief replies to your questions are as follows below:First, you can report the ### to your local government's code enforcement department; depending on where precisely this property is located, this might be the City of Greensboro, Guilford County, or the government of another town in the county, if the property is within the incorporated limits of the same.Second, not sure what you mean by help helping my tenants but Legal Aid of NC would be a good place to start; they have an office in Greensboro that you can look up by googling Legal Aid of NC Greensboro Office."Third not sure what you mean about "not provid[ing] insurance or taxes."  This is unclear.Fourth you cannot do anything about the low pay as long as your employer is paying you the required minimum wage under federal law which currently is $### unless your job falls under one of several exemptions of the federal minimum wage law (I doubt it but it is possible).Fifth as to not spending money on repairs if the failure to repair means that the properties are not up to local building code the local government inspectors will investigate if called and a fine can be assessed against the owner to compel compliance.  Otherwise the tenants should speak with either a Legal Aid of NC lawyer or a lawyer that they independently hire in landlord tenant law from private practice to sue the landlord in order to get a money judgment for rent abatement from the Guilford County Small Claims Court section of District Court.Hope this helps on most of the questions you raised if not all of them.  Feel free to follow up with clarifications to the extent desired or needed.  Have a safe and blessed winter."44166.9902777778 How do I report my bosses for being ### and keep my job?I need help helping my tenants. Are there any programs in Greensboro?My job does not provide insurance or taxes. What can I do about this?I get paid crumbs for the work I do. What can I do about this situation?My bosses don't like to spend money on repairs for the complex. How do I handle such problems?44166.8430555556 I understand that criminal questions CANNOT be asked.  My question does include reference to a criminal matter but my question is in regards to civil.  I recently had an OFA for a FTA that was issued in error. Per Cumberland Co NC public defender  due to COVID people werenâ€™t allowed to sit in court, I was to be on a ###, I was available all day but no one called.Long story short, judge ordered me to pay money on a separate civil dispute in order to recall this erroneous OFA that he acknowledged was erroneous as my PD stated it was his fault. Was the judge allowed to enforce a civil judgment that he had no part of? Was he allowed to use the OFA for FTA on a separate criminal matter that I have not had a trial for yet as a means to force me to pay? I donâ€™t know where to go or who to trust, the whole issue is erroneous but I have no money for a lawyer. 44173.7777777778 I would write a letter saying that you received the FTA in error because you were on call and no one called you.  See if you can get the public defender to put in writing that it was not your fault that you were not in court or if he will sign the letter you write to give to the judge. Ask the PD to advocate for you on that point. The FTA should be removed because it is was not proper.  Bring copies with you to the clerk's office and have it put in the court file of the criminal case.  When the case is called to court for a hearing, you should have another chance to have it removed if the letter does not work.  44173.825 Good evening, Mr. Long:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  It is entirely permissible for the court officials to limit access to the courtroom for reasons affecting the health, safety and welfare of those persons inside the courthouse building--especially during an extraordinary time, such as a pandemic.  This is not a violation of a person's First Amendment rights, and even so, the First Amendment is not relevant here since this has nothing to do with the right to assemble, petition, practice religion, or engage in freedoms of speech or the press.Nonetheless, I appreciate your concern and your question.

You obviously did not obtain the title to the motorcycle when you purchased it.  These type of things will happen if you do not handle legal transfer transactions in the proper way.

That's how it happened.44239.6909722222 I'm sorry you have not received a response before now.  I am afraid it may be because your question is too vague.  We have no idea whether this is in a criminal or a civil context - why you were even in an encounter with the police - whether you were in your home or a public location - whether they asked to take your phone - etc.  You may want to begin again and provide more information.  44239.6236111111 OK.  So it appears this was in the course of a criminal investigation and law enforcement would say that you (and perhaps your wife) were obstructing that investigation.  I assume they threatened to arrest you (and/or your wife) with obstructing a law enforcement investigation, and therefore you chose to provide your password.  Is this close to what happened?44239.6979166667 They won't even answer me. And by all accounts it's a violation44239.7423611111 Because I would not help them and he well they got mad at me and took it and made me give the password or lock my wife up on a trumped up charge .

I have practiced criminal law extensively, and I am not familiar with what a ### is exactly.  If you mean that they waited for someone they suspected of a crime to come to a location, they may arrest the person if they have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or with a warrant.  For the police to enter a home, most off the time they need a warrant to do so except for in a few circumstances.  If you have been charged with a crime and cannot afford an attorney, the court will appoint you one if you are found to be indigent or unable to pay an attorney.  Your attorney or public defender should be able to explain exactly what the law is based on the circumstances of your specific situation and be able to answer questions about the ###. If you are charged, ask the judge if he or she will appoint you a public defender.  Good luck.44201.8944444444 What are the procedures for law enforcement officers have to take for a ###?44194.0604166667 Dear Mr. ###: I am so, so sorry to hear about your son getting shot.  No parent should have to experience that.  I hear what you are saying that the police knew about the setup and were watching where the robbery was happening.  It sounds like you are saying they could have prevented the shooting since they had a tip about the robbery.  Unfortunately, it is not clear that the police knew the situation was going to take that deadly turn, and they probably cannot be held responsible for what someone else did.  They may have known about the robbery, but it doesn't mean they knew anybody was about to get shot. You can also request more information about the incident from the police department, and if you think an officer did something wrong, you can also ask the police to conduct an Internal Affairs inquiry. Another option is to talk to an attorney who does civil plaintiff's work.  Someone may talk to you just to hear what you have to say without charging you.  Overall though, I don't think the police can be held responsible for what happened here since they are not the ones who did the shooting. That is just one opinion.  I can understand why you feel like someone should be responsible. That is understandable.   One other thing that has nothing to do with the police, but may be helpful is getting help with medical bills.  North Carolina has a Crime Victims' Compensation Fund.  The application can be found here on the right hand side:  https://www.ncdps.gov/dps-services/victim-services/crime-victim-compensation.   The application is not that hard to fill out, but you will need a copy of the police report to fill in some of the answers. I am the same attorney who answered your other question about the ###, and I see that I was incorrect about you facing charges.  I am assuming your son is not charged with anything because he is the one who was shot.  If he is charged with something, definitely talk to his attorney or public defender about this situation.  If you want someone to be accountable, you could consider contacting the New ### District Attorney's Office and let them know you are the victim's father and you want to be informed about every court date for the person charged with shooting your son.  If the person who shot him was arrested, there are going to be court dates.  I am very sorry to hear about your son, and I hope he is doing ok.  Of course, very sorry to hear about the loss of the other two people.  Gun violence produces too many ### like this one these days.  Take care and best of luck with this. 44201.9069444444 My son was involved in a robbery and was shot.  He was ### as well as the other two men.   He was the only one survived.

If the answer is no, you need a lawyer. If the answer is yes, you should still consider engaging a lawyer to represent you.  Most lawyers when they face legal disputes, hire other lawyers to represent themselves. An analogy that is often used to answer these types of questions is this:  Do I need a car mechanic to change my oil? Maybe not, if you know how to do it yourself. Definitely, if you have no idea how to do it yourself.  Probably, if you have an idea of how to do it yourself, but you don't do it on a regular basis or are unfamiliar with the vehicle or the oil.As to generally how to file a lawsuit, to commence a lawsuit, a party generally files a document called a complaint" with the clerk of court and pays the filing fee. Thereafter the clerk will issue a civil summons (you must provide the paperwork for the clerk to sign).  In a complaint generally you must state the factual and legal basis for the allegations of wrongdoing by the person who you are suing.  Also generally included in a complaint are the requisite allegations that demonstrate the court has the authority to hear the dispute - which is called personal and subject matter jurisdiction.  After the complaint is filed and a summons issued - the person you are suing must be "served" a copy of these two documents.  this is generally done by the Sheriff.  After service is accomplished the original summons must be filed with the clerk and there must be adequate evidence filed with the clerk that copies of the complaint and summons were properly served.

Honestly, I am not entirely sure of whether this constitutes a HIPAA violation, as this issue can be a little murky when it comes to student records that reference both biological parents (or legally adoptive parents, when applicable).  However, assuming that there was a violation, if you have already filed a compliant with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, allow their investigators to look into this and determine for certain, based on their own regulations, whether a HIPAA violation occurred.  Ultimately, U.S. DHHS has the ultimate say in whether a violation occurred or otherwise.(FYI, although you might already know this, HIPAA itself does not authorize civil suits for violations, only complaints to DHHS, which you appear to have already done.)Blessings to you and your son in 2021--academically, professionally, financially, emotionally and ###.44215.9486111111 Hello, my son recently had his records requested from his father. In those records, unbeknownst to me, my personal medical history was included in those records. If I knew my personal history was going to be seen by people other than my sonâ€™s doctors, I would have never included my history. My sonâ€™s father and I are currently going through a custody battle and he should not have any rights to nor knowledge of my medical history. I spoke with the facility who sent the records. They stated that is how HIPAA is and they are unable to redact that information, but Iâ€™m able to amend it. She also told me she wasnâ€™t sure why I received a copy because it was being sent to my sonâ€™s father and it shouldnâ€™t have came to me. They also faxed him a copy. If I never received that copy by accident, I ### never known this incident took place.This incident has been very stressful and I find it somewhat uncivil this happened. Is this allowed to happen or am I correct when saying this is a HIPAA violation?Currently, there is no pending case, but I have filed a complaint.Thank you for your time.44215.8881944444 A complainant has gone through the process of mediation with the office of civil rights between themselves and a university. The basic terms are that the university pays the complainant a certain amount of money for restitution and the complainant drop the complaint against the university. The complainant is also required to sign a non-disclosure agreement and never file another complaint with anyone against the university ever about any issue the complainant had with the school (not just the matter addressed in the original ### complaint, which was sexual harassment) unless it happens after the date in the agreement. Can the university legally bar the complainant from making a complaint if it is regarding a separate issue from the original complaint and If the complainant violates the terms of the agreement what are the possible actions the university can take?44217.9125 This response is not legal advice and should not be the basis of any decision without actual and personalized guidance of an attorney engaged by you to do so.

If the complainant violates the terms of the agreement what are the possible actions the university can take?If a party to an agreement violates the terms of an agreement, the other party can file suit for breach of contact, and seek all available remedies which could include payment of damages, injunctive relief to stop the on-going violation, orders of specific performance requiring the breaching party to comply with the terms, among other possible remedies which might be available depending on the precise terms of the agreement and the circumstances.I strongly encourage you to engage the service of a lawyer who can review your situation and provide individualized and customized guidance based on your situation and the present facts and circumstances - and provide a precise answer to your questions.44230.1208333333 Good afternoon,Recently, it was confirmed by DHHS that a HIPAA violation occurred. My sonâ€™s father requested his records and my medical history were in those records. This has caused me a great amount of stress because we are in the middle of a custody battle. I would never let him have ### of my medical history. Because it was confirmed that a HIPAA violation did take place, am I able to file a civil suit?Currently, there is no pending case.44221.8340277778 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  HIPAA does not authorize private civil suits, so whatever action U.S. DHHS opted to take is dispositive of the violation.  However, if you are in the middle of custody litigation, I would certainly bring this to the attention of the judge presiding over your case when you have your next court hearing.Besides that, there is not much you can do above and beyond what DHHS is willing to do.Blessings and many good things to you in 2021.44221.9979166667 No problem, Ms. ###.  Nothing that you have written here indicates grounds for a lawsuit.  Simply being in distress does not justify a civil suit; there has to be some overt act or omission by the ### defendant that causes a legal injury, and the claim that would be asserted at law would have to be recognized under either NC or federal law.  Because HIPAA does not authorize civil suits for violations, at this present time, there is no viable lawsuit to pursue.  That could change later, but based on what you have posted here, I see no reason for a lawsuit.  Hopefully what you dread will happen will not occur.Best wishes, again.44222.0569444444 Thank you, I apologize, I should have been more detailed in my question. Because I have been in such distress over my medical history being in the hands of someone who may use it against me. Is that cause for a civil suit ?44222.0506944444 Have a quick immigration question.I just became US citizen in November:Want to file for My Mother(Have visitor visa) and Brother(age ######) . Currently both are in ###.What would be better option:###) just file for a mother and once she is US GC holder, she can file by brother as unmarried child.###) I file i-###.(as he is last member in family can he get any benefits like Child Protection or anything similar ?) my dad passed away ###.###.Or can I opt for both options ?44223.1631944444 I expect USCIS will require a birth certificate, but you can try submitting it later. If you don't submit it initially, they may issue a Request for Evidence (###) requesting it at a later date.44223.6527777778 Thanks so much for a quick reply.I am thinking to apply for my brother both the ways if that is an feasible option:Documents so far I have is:Petitioner (Me)Passport CopyNaturalization CopyState Driving LicenseBirth CertificateBeneficiary ###: MotherPassportBirth Certificate (To be provided later : My mother do not have a birth certificate in hand. We are in process or retrieving it from a court matter from ###. But I can still go-ahead and submit I-### ?) Beneficiary ###: BrotherPassport Birth Certificate44223.6368055556 Thanks so much for your kind help and support !44223.65625 The better option would be option ### â€“ file for your mother, and once she is a legal permanent resident, she can file for your brother as an unmarried son (provided he is still unmarried at that time).This is the better option only because it is quicker. Currently for the F2B category, which is for unmarried sons and daughters ###, the government is processing cases of Indian ### that were filed in ######5. In contrast, in the F###, which is for siblings of US citizens, the government is currently processing cases of Indian ### filed in ###05.There are no benefits available to him under the Child Status Protection Act, nor any benefits because your father died.You could opt for both options, but unless we see a dramatic legal shift, it will be quicker to petition for your mom and have her receive legal permanent residency, and then petition for your brother.If an immigration reform ### passes that changes how visa preference categories work, it is possible the process could be quicker and/or different. If such a law does pass, I recommend you consult with an immigration attorney to learn if you should adjust your strategy. You can find a list of attorneys who are members of the American Immigration Law Association in North Carolina here. There are also several nonprofits in North Carolina that can assist immigrants for low or no cost, such as Legal Services of the Southern Piedmont and Pisgah Legal Services. You can find more information about them online.44223.6138888889 You are welcome. Best of luck!44223.6583333333 Iâ€™m a current international student with ###. Prior to applying to the university Iâ€™m currently enrolled in now, they were still issuing OPT endorsements for international students (this was around ###; before the pandemic). The official last day for this semester is on ###. With exactly ###, I went to my DSO to ask about my OPT since itâ€™s a requirement to start processing the application during this timeframe to avoid ###. All they needed to do is determine Iâ€™m eligible and leave me to apply to USCIS myself. However, my DSO suddenly said that the university is not currently sponsoring studentsâ€™ OPT requests since theyâ€™re â€œnot legally required toâ€. We werenâ€™t made aware that the ISO has made decisions to repeal the offer, nor were we given adequate notice. My ### ### is ticking and I only have a few days left since USCIS does not approve applications that come in ###. That only gives me less than a month. The school doesnâ€™t seem to be all that sympathetic. When I started to worry and asked for advice they told me that their obligation to me ends once I attain my degree so I have ###. My DSO said that they â€œhavenâ€™t made any decisionsâ€ regarding the OPT endorsements and that theyâ€™re still talking about it. But thereâ€™s no sense of urgency or empathy at all on their part. Students who graduated last semester were denied the right to apply for it as well. Iâ€™ve already started to look at graduate schools for my masters in order to remain in status, but I just wanted to ask if thereâ€™s anything I could do. Did we international students at least have a right to be informed in a timely manner so that we ### made the appropriate arrangements and not get saddled with an institution that wasnâ€™t going to support us in our endeavors, or am I asking for too much? Is it legal for them to take this long to make a decision that could be detrimental to us? Had I known they were going to do this, I ### transferred to a different school since other universities have NO issue offering their students OPT. Now Iâ€™m stuck. Is it false advertising if they originally said they offer OPT then suddenly take it away? These people have no regard for us and itâ€™s been extremely difficult dealing with them. So many futures are on the line. I already have a job offer -which isnâ€™t a requirement for OPT- but they donâ€™t care. Theyâ€™re just taking their sweet time. I have worked so hard to get here. I have one of the highest ### and have excelled academically. Is there anything we could do? Any rights that we have? Do we at least get a chance to have our endorsements approved even when they havenâ€™t made any lasting decisions yet?44225.3534722222 I was pulled over on the 1st of February for an alleged speeding violation, upon seeing the trooper blue light me I unlocked my glovebox and opened it while pulling over. I always keep my handgun locked in the glovebox as required by NC law if it's not openly carried in the vehicle. I started doing this to ease officers minds so they can immediately see the firearm and see my hands on the wheel instead of them asking if there's a weapon in the vehicle and then being on edge because they don't have eyes on it.When the trooper approached my passenger door and knocked on the window I ### it down and before ever speaking the first word he reaches into my vehicle and takes my firearm. After returning and threatening me with concealed weapon charges because he doesn't know the carry laws he's trying to enforce claiming it's illegal to lock it in the glovebox" he finally throws my firearm back into my vehicle along with my license.I'm trying to obtain information on whether or not it's worth pursuing litigation against the trooper for an illegal search and seizure of my vehicle and personal property. My understanding of the law is that for an officer to seize your firearm they have to have reasonable suspicion that you're in the process of will or have committed a crime; or that you're a danger to yourself or others. If this is correct does a traffic stop for alleged speeding give him the authority to sidestep my ### amendment rights as he sees fit? I'm planning on fighting the legitimacy of the stop anyways as the trooper stopped me miles after when he claimed I was speeding because I passed a firetruck that was driving slow in the fast lane on the interstate. I truly don't think I was going anywhere near the speed he claimed however of course you have to speed up to get around someone If I continued at the higher rate of speed I can understand being stopped but I believe the trooper was just looking to screw with someone given his hostile and arrogant demeanor during the stop. As well as his constant attempt to intimidate and threaten me with more charges since he only threatened them and didn't charge me I feel that shows he knew I was perfectly legal however wanted to scare me into believing his version of the law.Again any clarification would be appreciated as well as any recommendations for attorneys in the area I've called many but keep being told they don't deal with civil rights issues. I also want to obtain the troopers dash cam if possible as it's the only recording of the incident since troopers don't wear body cameras. Thanks."44235.6673611111 It is certainly your right to go to court and contest the speeding ticket by pleading not responsible or not guilty if you do not believe that you were speeding. You can always request dash cam video from the State Highway Patrol through the court process. You're overarching question is whether it is worth pursuing litigation against the trooper for a violation of your ### Amendment rights.  Probably not. You may be able to find a lawyer to represent you in a civil claim against the trooper, but it will be a long, arduous process that is not likely to succeed. Spending your money, focus, and energy contesting the actual speeding ticket may be more fruitful in terms of minimizing your insurance increases and court costs.  Honestly, not seeing any legal issue with the stop if the trooper used radar. If you were my relative, I'd say go to court, ask for a reduction, pay the ticket, slow down, and move on from this. Good luck! 44243.0590277778 Good Sunday afternoon to you, Mr. Whitener:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  Only a civil rights lawyer or criminal defense lawyer who consults with you in a confidential setting can inform you for certain as to whether you have any legal options with respect to the phone.

I'm also attaching a memo that the North Carolina Attorney ###eral published that outlines the regulations for both open-carry and conceal carry permits.  It's long and detailed, but you might find it helpful. Note that it was published in ### ### (see below).Restrictions on Open Carry:With exceptions for a small number of specified government employees and security guards, North Carolina ###erally prohibits any person from carrying a firearm, whether openly or concealed (with a permit), into the following locations:Educational facilities. N.C. ###. Stat. Â§ 14-269.2.A law enforcement or correctional facility.A state or federal building or office of the state or federal government. N.C. ###. Stat. Â§ 14-269.4.Any private property where the legal possessor has posted conspicuous notice or stated that carrying a concealed handgun is prohibited; orAny place where the carrying of a concealed firearm is prohibited under federal law.North Carolina also ###erally prohibits persons without a concealed handgun permit from carrying any firearms into the following locations:Any parade, funeral procession, picket line, or demonstration upon any private health care facility or public place. N.C. ###. Stat. Â§ 14-277.2.Any assembly where a fee has been charged for admission, or any establishment in which alcoholic beverages are sold and consumed, (except by the owner or lessee of the premises or establishment, or by a person participating in the event carrying a gun with the permission of the owner, lessee, or event sponsor). N.C. ###. Stat. Â§ 14-269.3.Certain local city and county ordinances may prohibit open-carry:Local governments may have specific ordinances prohibiting the carrying of a concealed handgun on a municipal and county playground, athletic field, swimming pool, or athletic facility. N.C. ###. Stat. Â§ ###State Fair:  The North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture may prohibit firearms at the State Fair. N.C. ###. Stat. Â§ 106-503.2Vehicle Carry: Must be Visible and Not Concealed:  A person without a concealed handgun permit can carry a loaded handgun in a vehicle if it is visible and not concealed.  â€œConcealedâ€ means the handgun cannot be readily seen by a person approaching the vehicle and the gun is readily accessible.  For example, a handgun under the front seat, back seat, or in an unlocked glove box or console is considered â€œconcealedâ€ and â€œreadily accessibleâ€ and therefore illegal if the owner does not have a concealed handgun permit.  A handgun openly displayed or in a locked glove box, locked console, or in the ### is lawful.  (But note that if you are driving a van or SUV that does not have a separate ###, simply putting the handgun all the way in the back may be considered concealed" and "readily accessible").

This is a very serious situation, as it is clear from reading the complaint you attached (thank you for this; very informative and helpful), and based on what I know about ### ###' reputation in the business litigation field (although I have no formal relationship with him that would prevent me from giving you candid, confidential advice on this site, which I do freely and with your best interests in mind), I can tell you that this is no idle litigation threat.  However, I do see a couple problems with the other side's strategy to this.First, since the ### plaintiff insists that you did sign a valid non-compete in 2014, the logic begs the question of why they would come back to you and ask you to sign a second one in 2021, when you are no longer employed with AX Control?Second, even if you were willing to sign a new non-compete, it is not valid unless you were offered something valuable--usually money--in return.  This is called consideration and it is required in virtually any type of contractual situation.  If you signed a new non-compete in order to avoid a lawsuit, you have every right to demand that you be paid compensation--or provided something that you subjectively, and a reasonable person, objectively, would consider valuable.  The potential strengths of AX Control's case center on whether the allegations in sum of Paragraphs ### ###--namely, that you shared confidential, protected proprietary information, and your boyfriend used that information to further his own business, with your active participation.  If you did in fact sign the ###, and the AX Control could prove this and the instances of breach of contract, civil conspiracy, and other claims alleged (or at least those two, even if the other ones were dismissed or withdrawn later in the case), that would be enough to win a substantial damage award against you and your boyfriend.One preemptive strategy would be to hire counsel to write a letter to ### ### on behalf of you and your boyfriend, detailing that the business your boyfriend piloted has shut down its operations--entirely and permanently--and that both of you have gone on to other, unrelated ventures vis-Ã -vis AX Control.  This might prevent a lawsuit from happening.  Another strategy is to sign a new agreement as requested, but demand fair and adequate consideration in exchange for your doing so.  Otherwise, you and your boyfriend would likely need to prepare to defend yourselves in a lengthy and costly lawsuit, and retain business litigation counsel for that purpose.Hopefully this can be resolved just short of litigation, but if so, you will need to act quickly.Blessings and good things to you and your boyfriend in 2021. 44271.9604166667 I was fired in ### ###. My boyfriend and a friend of ours had started a business in the same industry prior to me being fired. The company was not a competing business, just sold similar products. After being fired, I began working for my friendâ€™s business. A few months in, we began selling products that competed with my former employer. Since I hadnâ€™t signed a non-compete while working there, I wasnâ€™t worried about it. In ###20, my friend and I both received cease and desist letters from my former employerâ€™s lawyer, saying I was violating my employment agreement. They asked that my friendâ€™s company fire me and cease selling competing products. We told them we were unaware of any employment contract and asked for a copy. They provided one that I had supposedly signed when hired in 2014, but even after looking at it hundreds of times since, I donâ€™t have any memory of signing this document. Regardless, my friend complied with the request and not only stopped selling competing products, but shut down the business entirely. Since then, I have lost contact with the friend who ran the business, and my boyfriend and I have moved on to other things (heâ€™s going to school, Iâ€™m seeking other employment).On ###th, I received another letter from my former employerâ€™s lawyer. They are threatening to sue me, my boyfriend, and our former friend unless all three of us sign a new non-compete agreement. I disregarded this email, thinking it to be a scare tactic since the original agreement expires in ###, but their lawyer reached out again on ###th to say that they will file first thing today if we didnâ€™t sign within ###.I would like some advice as to how to proceed, and any guidance on how to apply for legal aid or seek a lawyer of my own would be greatly appreciated.44270.7930555556 Good afternoon: This is not going to be a successful libel or slander claim.

There is a lot going on here, and you need to speak with a lawyer to unpack all of this.  While your post is insufficiently descriptive by which to determine whether a civil rights violation has occurred, I strongly recommend consulting with a civil rights litigator in ### or elsewhere in the North Carolina Piedmont ### Region, so that you get the benefit of a detailed conversation about all relevant facts.  Determining a civil rights violation is a very ### analysis, so a consultation with a civil rights litigator will be more informative to you than is a Q&A website like this one.To help you in your search, consider going to ### and using the Find a Lawyer" feature.  Searching by NC town or city you can locate lawyers under the "Civil Rights" practice area category.  Also you can contact the North Carolina Bar Association Lawyer Referral Service.  See at the link below if interested:https://www.ncbar.org/members/resources/lawyer-referral-service/Best wishes to you this spring and in 2021.  I wish you the very best in all aspects of life going forward."44295.1541666667 My name has been misspelled in the legal system since my first charge when I was 16. They have multiple aliases listed for me that I have never provided to them in any situation, but Iâ€™ve been told that aliases are â€œwhat THEY know me as, not who Iâ€™ve told them I am.â€ They have my twin ### name as one of my aliases and I was falsely imprisoned for him - I missed the birth of my son because of it. I also failed to get a job because they had my ### felony charge under my name. The day before Easter this year, I was arrested & told I had a warrant for a failure to appear for a court date my lawyer said was continued. When I pressed the issue, the cop said that the OFA was tied to â€œone of my aliasesâ€ - a misspelled version of my name. If I didnâ€™t have bond money that night, I ### missed Easter with my ###â€™ve had. The police always tell me a judge has to fix this but the judges donâ€™t ever do that. I feel completely disrespected & this has been way more than a simple inconvenience. My question is - how do I pursue a case? Most lawyers wonâ€™t respond & a few have said I donâ€™t have a case. How is that possible? How is this legal?44295.1291666667 I was hired on as a restaurant General Manager and went into training.  My Offer Letter stated both that position and that my salary would be $### / year.  After training for about 11-###, I was called for a meeting and was told that there was no a position for me (even though the company continued to advertised for the same position at that salary).  I was informed that I would be demoted and placed as an Assistant Restaurant Manager under a younger person, who had been out of training for two-three weeks.  I agreed to this part, BUT then I was told that my salary would be reduced to $16.###.  I disagreed.  I was offered the opportunity to come up with a satisfactory pay rate" and this would be revisited.  I did so but that meeting never happened.  I believe all of this was to force me to resign because of my age.  I contacted the EEOC and even though the outcome I had hoped for did not happen I was issued a Right To Sue Letter.  I have all documents related to this ordeal including the Offer Letter the Compromise letter I was asked to create the EEOC correspondence and I wish to sue or consider my next option.I am currently collecting Unemployment Benefits (for the reason of my salary being reduced) along with SNAP benefits to allow me to search for another job.  Thank you.### #########"44297.7597222222 Mr. ###,We are sorry to hear that you are in this situation, but hope to provide some guidance for how you can proceed.So far, you have followed the right process by filing your claim with the EEOC and obtaining your Right to Sue Letter. The second page of the Right to Sue Letter you received provides really helpful instructions on what you should do next, and I would encourage you in particular to review the second paragraph (discussing filing a complaint), fourth paragraph (attorney representation for ### claims) and the fifth paragraph (attorney referral and EEOC assistance).The next step would be for you to file a lawsuit to formally bring your claim for age discrimination.  You can file a complaint yourself (we call this filing pro se") but it is advisable to call around to some attorneys to see whether they would be willing to take your case. Often attorneys who represent plaintiffs in discrimination lawsuits will do so on a "contingency" basis which means you do not pay them on an hourly basis as is typical but instead they would receive a portion of whatever you end up winning if you successfully settle or win your case. Please keep in mind that you have a relatively short deadline to file your lawsuit following the right to sue letter (### per the EEOC Right to Sue Letter you received). so please be sure to act quickly and start calling attorneys to assist you as soon as possible.We hope this answer is helpful. We are leaving this question open in case you have some follow up questions."44302.8819444444 Good afternoon, ###:You are off to a good start; I commend you for acting so promptly towards an early resolution of this lawsuit.  When a lawyer representing a plaintiff is offered a settlement sum, it is customary to prepare, in exchange, a Voluntary Dismissal With Prejudice, which is covered by Rule ###.  Yes, if properly worded, a dismissal with prejudice ends the lawsuit forever.  The settlement agreement really needs to be reviewed by a lawyer hired by you to read it over very carefully, and make suggestions; this site is not designed to be that comprehensive.  You can get the document reviewed in a consultation.  Many lawyers would charge a modest fee for this service, which would not take long to competently render.Best way to make payment is by certified bank check, which would include a bank stub for you to keep with your records; you should also photocopy the check/stub for your records, which the bank tellers can do for you at your request.  I would either hand deliver the payment or mail it by certified mail.Remember my previous comment about no admission of fault, negligence, etc., in my response on Friday.Best wishes to you, and congratulations on achieving a real prospect of settlement.  Keep the Motion for Extension of Time in mind, however, just in case you end up needing to file it before the ###.44298.9111111111 Greetings and thank you so much for your time,I received a notice, which was delivered by the sheriff on ###, that a civil action has been commenced against me for a breach of contract and that I must respond within ###.  I have reached out to the plaintiff's attorney and we have decided on a settlement agreement.  The plaintiff's attorney has offered to prepare a voluntary dismissal with prejudice to be filed upon  payment" of the agreed amount.  Will the "voluntary dismissal with prejudice" completely resolve the case without the potential of it being brought back to court?  Is there anything else that I need to request be included in the settlement agreement?  What do I need to request from plaintiff's attorney as proof that I paid & that this is payment in full for said lawsuit (will be making payment via money order)?Thank you in advance for your consideration regarding this matter."44298.8541666667 Thank you so much for your time and excellent communication skills in our digital world.

They simply post bonds on the ones they know about and are surprised to learn that there are others.  If there are any other charges against him with additional bonds, he will not be released.  Also, you might check and see if there were additional requirements of release.  For instance, if one of the requirements was house arrest and there are no available ankle bracelets, he will have to wait for one to become available OR if he doesn't have a telephone landline at the location of house arrest, then they might not be able to hook it up.

This is a distressing situation, and I agree with you about not wanting to be recorded anywhere in a living unit, common area or not.  Legally speaking, I think your roommate's actions are about 50-###; this is a tricky situation.  On the one hand, this could be argued to be just barely legal so long as no one is recorded in a bathroom or bedroom (where any reasonable person would always expect privacy, no matter what), it also could be argued, on the other hand, that most tenants reasonably expect not to be recorded even in living rooms, hallways and/or kitchens.  Honestly, I am not sure how this would play out in court, since, as I said, this is in the 50-###.  The best thing you can do--which would not require legal fees--would be to get the landlord to intervene, if that is at all possible.  Otherwise, you would have to hire a lawyer to send your roommate a letter threatening a lawsuit if the recording does not stop, and then follow up on that threat if the roommate does not cease and desist.  Not an altogether pleasing response, I admit, but an accurate one based what I know about privacy law and recordings.Best wishes to you this spring.44316.8951388889 I live in an apartment with my brother and two other people.

Yes, you are correct that this would be a civil rights issue, and the statute of limitations is likely three years.  The only way to present any credible kind of claim for your brother against state or local authorities (depending on where your brother was incarcerated) is to persuade a civil rights litigator that your brother's case has merit.  If several lawyers have already turned down the case, that might be an indication that they do not believe that a strong claim can be asserted; normally, civil rights lawyers have no problem taking cases against state and local government entities, since both are covered by insurance, thereby guaranteeing that they will get paid if they succeed in obtaining a jury award at trial, an order of summary judgment from the judge, or a settlement with the authority who incarcerated your brother.  I can only say that you will need to keep looking for counsel who might be interested in the case, since this website is set up to be a Q&A site for general legal questions.If you have not already, consider using ### Find a Lawyer" feature and searching by North Carolina town or city under "Civil Rights."  You can likely find some reputable firms that handle these types of cases--in firms located in ### ### Chapel Hill and elsewhere (you might even wish to go as far as Greensboro or ### in your search).  One thing I can assure you: if provable facts are on your brother's side you can find a civil rights litigation firm willing to take this matter up.(You can also contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association and ask for referrals in civil rights litigation.)Blessings to you and your family this spring."44328.1659722222 My brother ### ### was involved in an altercation in the jail in which he was set up by the guards and suffered serious injuries to where heâ€™s no longer able to do anything for his self from being stabbed in the head with a mop handle by another inmate this happened at the way county jail Iâ€™ve been calling all around trying to get an attorney and I have had no help and no help everyone is turned me down this is my last hope for what Iâ€™ve been told this is a civil case because his civil rights were violated by not getting the proper care while being incarcerated I know thereâ€™s a time statue want things this happened ###1944328.0069444444 Isn't under color of law supposed to be a law?

She cancelled the day before we start verbal contract  and cash deposit. Can I go to jail for not paying her back44343.7597222222 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  You cannot go to jail for this since this is a civil contracts matter; the real and more pertinent question is whether you can be sued.  It depends, but it would be difficult for the homeowner to successfully sue you on a verbal contract, especially one that includes a deposit.  I believe that you could keep, at minimum, the sum that you already spent on materials, but if you want to be more assured that you can avoid a Small Claims Court lawsuit, you might consider a partial refund.  I am not certain that it was right for the homeowner to cancel the job at the last minute, but this is one of the key problems with verbal contracts involving labor: once there is one disagreement, the entire deal can blow apart, leaving both parties feeling exposed and taken advantage of.  Whether you refund part or all of the deposit depends in large part on your ### for risk.Unless it was explicitly stated between you, verbally, that your deposit was nonrefundable, there is at least some chance that the homeowner could prevail if she decided to sue you for a refund.  I am not sure that she would win, but that is a possibility.I think this is a 50-###.  I hope this is helpful in some way.Blessings to you and yours this summer in ### County.44343.9159722222 I am a Registered Nurse who worked 11.###, ### Health. ###.

Since it is your mother's house, she can invite and exclude people. This includes your sister. Establishing residency there does not also ensure that you can prevent your sister from coming inside. Unless you have a rental agreement, lease, or your name on the deed, you are in a rather precarious position as far as dictating who may or may not enter. Massachusetts law gives many rights to tenants, but even though you are living in the home, you could (worst case for you) be considered a mere licensee" without something in writing that spells out explicitly the agreement you have with your mother regarding staying in the home. As a practical matter since she has a key there isn't a very good way to keep her out. Your mother may or may not be in agreement with changing the locks. If you are considered a tenant in the home  you do have certain rights; including the right to exclude visitors in your space. But your mother also would have the right to invite your sister in. As owner of the home and still living there it's unlikely her wishes to allow someone in would be ignored by a court in favor of someone who just moved in despite the familial relationship. Requesting that someone calls before coming over isn't unreasonable but it's not something that a court will enforce as a civil right. Perhaps there are other solutions that would be easier on all three of you such as: set times for visiting a portion of the house that is off-limits for your sister meeting outside the home with your mother if she's still mobile and going out in the community or getting the key returned. If none of those options are viable you may wish to get a formal tenancy agreement with your mother that includes expectations regarding visitors.I hope this helps.### ###"43228.8479166667 My mother has asked me to care for her.

I am in the process of Adjusting my Status to a ### Card and as I do not have many resources I would like to do it by myself but I need some help.I have been searching for all the documents required for this process in the USCIS website but I would like to ask you to double-check that I am not missing any. So far I think these are the documents that I need:Form I-485Form I-864Form ###Form I-765Form I-131Form I-94Form ###Copy of From I-129FCopy of Spain Passport Bio PageCopy of K###Copy of Marriage CertificateCopy of Spain Birth Certificate (English)Two Passport-sized photosAm I missing any other necessary document?

Do I need to take the whole medical again or just the vaccinations?Thank you for your help.###43228.8486111111 Hi ###,It really sounds like you've done your homework!###. Two resources that I'd suggest you look at (I use these myself as an immigration attorney) if you haven't already:Official instructions for Form I-###://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-###85instr.pdfUSCIS website on ### cards for K visa holders https://www.uscis.gov/###-card/###-card-through-family/###-card-through-special-categories-family/k-nonimmigrant###. You do not need a Form I-###-###.###. As you'll see from the USCIS page on K visas, whether or not you need to re-do your medical examination in full has to do with (###) whether you are filing your I-### ###, (###) whether you were documented to have certain medical conditions (generally speaking, contagious diseases, vaccine-preventable diseases, mental disorders with harmful behaviors, and drug abuse or addiction - see here for more detailed info https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume8-PartB-Chapter###.html). If the answer to either question is yes, then you have to re-do the exam in full in the U.S.Whether you need to re-do the vaccination supplement only, with a USCIS civil surgeon in the U.S. (sometimes, depending on the surgeon, this will be cheaper than doing a full medical examination), depends on whether you submitted a properly completed vaccination record (DS ###0###5) from Spain.If you don't remember, it of course doesn't hurt to submit the vaccination supplement with your I-###85. This is likely the safest option for a smooth application experience.Another option you might want to choose to take, if cost of a USCIS civil surgeon is a concern, is to submit your application without the vaccination supplement. If USCIS determines that the vaccination supplement is required and is missing, then it will later send you a Request for Further Evidence, a new notice that will ask you to send the vaccination supplement to them. This can delay your application process by a few months, but it doesn't pose an issue in your ### card eventually being issued - USCIS won't hold it against you that you didn't subm###. Your list of documents is complete at minimum, but you should also submit:If you still have it, a copy of the I-### (I think that might be what you mean by Copy of Form I-######9F, but not sure)Your filing fee!

I have a severely ill family member that lives in Peru and is not receiving the proper treatment. I heard about the humanitarian VISA being an option so that he can receive treatment here. Can I more information about this and possibly a connection to a lawyer or agency that specializes in this area?Thanks,###43228.8486111111 I am very sorry to hear about your family member.Many of the rules about immigration are in flux right now so we are not able to give you an answer to your question.  You can contact one of the lawyer referral programs on this page, ###, to get a referral to a lawyer who specializes in immigration.  You will likely need to pay the laywer for the advice.  You can also try the Massachusetts Legal Resource Finder, www.masslrf.org, to see if there are any referrals to other providers that might be able to help.43228.8486111111 Dear Ms. ###: There are limited circumstances in which the law equates being fired with the employee being put in a situation in which he or she might feel â€œforced to quit.â€ The legal ### for such circumstances is â€œconstructive discharge.â€  Generally, a constructive discharge occurs whenever an employer makes the employeeâ€™s working conditions so difficult and intolerable that a reasonable person would feel forced to resign. The result is that an employee who has been constructively ###inated may be entitled to recover lost wages and other damages suffered as a result of the ###ination. That is particularly true if a contract was breached or if unlawful discrimination has occurred. For example, if you had a contract that entitled you to a particular ### of employment (e.g., a contract that said you were hired for a year, for two years, or for any other definite period of time), then you may be entitled to damages if you can prove that you were constructively discharged (or fired) prior to the expiration of that ###. (Most employees in Massachusetts do not have such â€œ###â€ contracts.  Instead, most employees in Massachusetts are at work on an â€œat willâ€ basis, which means that they can resign at any time and the employer can fire them at any time for any or no reason, as long as the reason is not one that is prohibited by law.) You thus may need to consider whether you were constructively discharged because of some unlawfully discriminatory reason. Federal and state law prohibit certain types of firings but not others, just as federal and state law prohibit certain types of â€œdiscriminationâ€ in the workplace but not others.  â€œDiscriminationâ€ (and firing) generally is unlawful if it occurs because of factors such as race, color, religious creed, ancestry, ethnic group, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual preference, age (###), or veteran status.   On the other hand, â€œdiscriminationâ€ (and firing) based on some other circumstances (e.g., poor performance, inability to get along with others, etc.) is not unlawful. The Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) is the state agency that assists employees with their nondiscrimination rights. More information on the MCAD, and on the subject of nondiscrimination in the workplace generally, is available at the MCADâ€™s website:  ###/ Or to get additional legal help with your problem, you also can try this website to find contact information for free and low cost sources of civil legal help and links to legal information: www.masslrf.orgIf you research further and decide that you need to hire a lawyer to assist you, you can use one of the lawyer referral services available through this website: ###And finally, you can use this website for other referrals to other help in Massachusetts: ###Good luck.- ###43228.8486111111 What do I do if I feel discriminated against from a former employee?Do I have rights if I feel I was forced to quit due to the Director,Supervisors,&Employees wereally clicked up, and conspired against me.?What can I do if I have proof of some of these same employees, breaking the rules, and their aware I have this proof,?Thank you,### ### 43228.8486111111 My ssn,### card came with a different name than the one i submitted to the embassy and i went to SSA and USCIS both refused to change it they said my first name, middle name written as one name without spacese and my middle name is missing,  instead it's written in the first name column !

After I graduate, I would like to stay on and work in the US for ######. This work must be in my primary field of study. There are not many jobs in playwriting and I'm struggling to find work. However, the next play I'm planning to write is going to be set in an American bar. OPT allows for candidates to do research in their field. Could I work as a bartender or bar-back as research for my play? In writing they say 'write what you know' and the best way to know what you're writing is to experience it, something we were often told in class. I would declare this work to my international student office, who in turn declare it to USCIS. When I discussed it with my International Student Advisor, she thought that it sounded like it should be okay, and the abstract creative nature of my degree would lend itself well to doing other types of work as research.In terms of supporting documents I should be able to get a letter from the head of my program saying she is pleased that I'm undertaking research for my next play, and if offered a job I would ask the employer to write a letter clarifying they are glad to employ me as I undertake said research.  I would also, by the end of the OPT period, have written the play itself, which I can present as a document. I should also be able to organize an informal reading/performance of the play in Boston, with emails and so on to show that it happened and people were invited. Does this sound like a reasonable use of OPT and not something which could jeopardize my future immigration prospects?

Based on the information you provided, if your girlfriend is not subject to the two year home physical presence requirement under her J-###, she does not necessarily need to leave the US and re-enter to get married.  The K-1 (Finance) Visa  is intended for a US citizen (you) to bring a foreign national fiancÃ© living abroad to the US to marry. One of the main requirements for K-### ###. And her K-### ###. The risk of this approach is that if her K-###, it is hard to predict how long the appeal process / when she will be able to return to the US. (Information found on: ###) Another option that may be available is for you marry her in the US (preferably before her J-###), and she may able to apply for adjustment of status (get a ### card) immediately.

Did you get (and ignore) a notice saying that the Office of Child Care Services found you to be operating an unlicensed family child care program?  If not, I wonder if this fine is illegal and could be challenged.

Yes, they can fine you before you are found guilty.  The fine is civil, and unrelated to your criminal charges.  Once you have been given a civil fine, you may appeal it within seven days by requesting administrative reconsideration.  You can always appeal final administrative decisions in the District Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. ###0A.###.  You are supposed to fined no more than $###.  I need to know more about the orders you were given before I can say whether they may fine you $500.###.   The community service time should be ### $###, which would mean ###, not 500.  Unfortunately, judges can put you in prison for failing to pay off your fines, though they are unlikely to do so if you are in severe financial difficulty and appear to be making an effort (doing a couple of hours of service whenever you can or paying $### $###.)  However, the longer your fine or community service time remains outstanding, the more often you will need to keep returning to court for status checks, which over time ends up taking more of your time than just doing the service would.  Failing to show up to court will result in a warrant for your arrest and time in jail.43228.8527777778 If you'd like to hire a lawyer, the Mass Bar Association can refer one to you.  ###43228.8527777778 My landlord is now sending me harassing text messages saying I didn't pay November's rent, I clearly did, I have the receipt.

In clearing a few points for you. This case should have started in higher court ( for well over ### )However I am at limited funds and forced to attempt to at least some compensation without an attorney.Therefore I I filed the complaint in the District ( ###)Court House small claims. ( no atty. required).It was the  District Court ### placed it as being Civil"  The magistrate hearing is as you described. I had chosen that route with the thought first it was less costly to taxpayers.And an easier approach for myself in speaking before the court.   I prepared for the date by gathering dozen estimates from insured moving companies as the clerks office recommended.Out of twelve I inquired I received five flat out "NO"  they wouldn't even attempt a move as this. There were three no responsethree agree to move  with payments made in advance. The cost results were anywhere between 8 - 45 thousand dollars.    As it turns out the court date arrives and I am in the hospital with pneumonia. My husband was allowed to stand for me as it was only to be a payment scheduled agreeable to both parties.    Defendant arrived without a second to spare. Upon the noon break he approached my husband and asked if we'd except $###. that's all he has.My husband responded with a " no we need to go before the judge."Court second session first case called and no defendant present. Habeas corpus.     At this point it has cost me living off my ### court filing fee $150.      Fee to request CD of Magistrate hearing to prove fault with appeal claims $50.Now "I" am to pay a $65. fee to have this defendant brought in.Results of ### and efforts 0 "43398.8798611111 Hello yet again.  I cannot review your entire case to advise you, although the details help in understanding it better.  I assume that you have tried and given up on retaining an attorney to assist you -- which might still be your best option.  Your pursuing a Small Claim" which you said was worth a small fraction of your actual losses might have been a mistake.  You might be barred from a second civil lawsuit for the original wrongs by the legal principle of claim preclusion; your new claims however probably are not barred by that principle.  If the defendant is wealthy and/or owns valuable property then some attorneys might take your case on a "contingent fee" basis -- expecting to be paid for their time by taking a share of what they win for you or by the Court ordering the defendant to pay your reasonable attorney's fee and court costs {possible in some civil actions under some laws like the Consumer Protection Act and the laws against Contempt of Court}.I still do not know what the court ordered after the ###rd hearing.  If the defendant did not comply with the original Magistrate's Order and if the ###rd order does not provide another direction then you might have grounds for a new Complaint for Contempt against the defendant (based on his alleged willful refusal or failure to comply with the known lawful order although I do not know if what the Magistrate did amounts to a "court order.")  You also might have a lawful basis to put an attachment on the defendant's property although I cannot be sure. If you want to send copies of your original complaint the Magistrate's order and the ###rd order through MLAO I might be able to review them and have other suggestions (although my availability to respond over the next ten days is not certain).  See if you can figure out what direction the Court was giving you with its orders.    "43403.7979166667 Hello, I am a retired legal services lawyer who has volunteered to respond to some of the inquiries made on Mass. Legal Answers On-Line (MLAO").  I cannot answer all your questions correctly because I do not have all the relevant information and I never had any case like yours seems to be.  However I noted that your "deadline" for something is today and apparently no other volunteer has responded yet.  So I will make a few comments which I hope might be helpful.  You might need to consult your own attorney for advice showing your attorney all the court-related and evidentiary documents for a full appraisal and more accurate and complete legal assistance.I am not familiar with the sort of "magistrate hearing" that you seem to describe; but I will guess that it was a District Court intervention to try to resolve your case without the necessity of a judge or a trial.  I do not see any basis for your having called it a "civil rights" case although it appears that the court office made a number of mistakes that you describe.  Your case seems to be one about your property rights and your commercial tenant rights.  I am not sure whether or not the alleged court procedural mistakes would have any effect on your rights to proceed with the case according to whatever court rules apply to your case.  (I believe that in Superior Court cases the parties have to comply with all post-judgment deadlines whether or not the court office mailed them a timely copy of the judgment.  I do not know what the rules for your case would require.)  If there is a court "deadline" given to preserve your right to a judge and to a trial to try to obtain a better result I'd guess that you should meet that deadline if you want to "appeal" the magistrate's decision to try for a better result before a judge or jury.  Please note that the original complaint in property damages and landlord fault cases typically only determine whether or not the defendant is liable for the plaintiff's ### and the monetary amount of the ### at the time that the complaint was brought (or sometimes the date of the hearing).  The idea of actually collecting the judgment amount awarded in the original case often requires a supplementary law suit if the defendant does not agree to pay up.  (Sometimes the amount and the terms are ### after the first judgment.  Occasionally other legal action is available to collect a judgment debt.  Rarely the debt goes away or is reduced through the debtor's subsequent bankruptcy.)You also describe additional problems that have allegedly occurred after your original complaint was filed and after the hearing.  You might have to go to the Superior Court to file a complaint in equity (which generally is not available to commercial tenants in District Court) seeking equitable relief and damages for the events occurring after the date of the filing of the original complaint and after the magistrate's hearing.  "Equitable relief" might include court orders protecting your property while it remains under the defendant's control on his property and permitting you to remove your property from his premises.  You might consider asking for an accounting and an appraisal of any damages to your remaining property before it is removed on the basis that any damages must have been caused by the defendant's willful or negligent actions.Yours is the sort of case where having your own attorney possibly working on a ### basis might be a big help; but I understand that your resources are limited.  Good luck!  P.S. MLAO does not provide any attorneys for representation.  "43396.7777777778 Hello, again.  I am not advising you what to do next: and the following is submitted as information that might or might not be helpful.  If you are still looking into how you will proceed with your small claims case pro se [without attorney representation], I would refer you to a book, Massachusetts Rules of Court, The Trial Court Rules Small Claims Rules" and "Small Claims Standards."  Your local Law Library should have a copy of the ###.  Again I have not done any small claims case and I cannot advise you particularly how the rules might correctly apply to your case -- the rules might help you to figure out better what has happened and how you might proceed.  I will highlight a few parts of the rules that might be considered.  I also hereby note that the District Court in your case might have gone outside the rules in one or more ways (which probably would complicate matters for you).  At the least I do not understand why the judge allowed your husband to represent you at the ### hearing {which seems to have violated Small Claims Rule 7(c)} unless your husband had been named as your co-plaintiff. Small Claims Rule ###.  The "judgment" is the judge's official statement of the outcome of the case after the scheduled trial.  (I still do not know how the magistrate's decision fits in.  Magistrates may decide small claims cases although there are procedures for cases to be referred to the judges for decision.  I do not know what happened in your case that took your case from the magistrate to the judge and possibly the rules that I highlight here are not applicable to your case.)  Rule 7(i) refers to the ### to be used if the defendant had failed to appear for the payment hearing (which might be what happened in your case) -- I believe that most likely such a ### is used to lawfully and forcibly bring the missing defendant before the judge (lawfully brought by a sheriff or constable if that is what the ### orders) to enforce the judgment for payment of the amount ordered by the court.   If the defendant has the means to pay the court usually can make him pay.  Of course if the defendant has no money and no property (or he claims no means and none can be shown) the court cannot squeeze payment (or blood) out of an empty vessel which might make the ### ###.  I noticed that Small Claims Standard 7:### "equitable relief" (such as orders for the defendant to return all your property to you or to allow you to remove all your property from his premises under fair conditions) which I believe you could request by a motion at a future hearing to which the defendant appears or is brought.  Small Claims Rule ### (which might be the place where your case is at). There is a small ### [beware]:  There might be a chance that the defendant still might be able to appeal the Small Claims Judgment against him if you drag him back to court by a ###.  His appeal might delay the results still longer (as my previous ### that he might file for bankruptcy relief which could delay or deny your monetary relief).  On the brighter side the Small Claims Rule 7(i) does seem to allow the court to order the defendant to pay you (in addition to the judgment amount) all or most of your post-judgment costs (such as the costs of a sheriff or constable to enforce the ### and to bring the defendant before the judge) -- which I believe that you would have to request at the hearing where the defendant has been brought.  You also might qualify (if very low income) as "indigent" for state payment of your costs to serve the ### (which require you to sign a sworn "Affidavit of Indigency" and have it approved by the court in advance of the service.)  The defendant has indeed hampered the "speedy and fair determination" of your case which is the standard legal reason for ordering a defendant to pay the plaintiff's legal costs.I do not think that there is much more that I could add to my responses; and I plan to close our MLAO communications about your case within the next ten days.  Good luck!  "43405.8006944444 Hello, again.  I am still confused about what your entire situation is and how you might best respond to it.  I do not see any appeal" actually described; and I do not comment about an appeal.  I do not know what the status of your case is with the court as you have mentioned both a ### corpus [used to have a person brought forcibly but lawfully into court to answer to some matter before the court]  and a default [a judgment issued because a party has not appeared for trial after having received lawful notice to appear]. In your case you described that the defendant showed up for the trial but left early after his offer was rejected by your husband.  I do not know why a ### corpus was issued and a default [judgment] was not entered by the court.  Perhaps your absence was a factor -- I cannot be sure.  I am not sure what your next best step would be.  I suggested some options in my first response which might still be available -- a separate legal action to recover or to protect your valuable property was one.  Negotiating with the defendant might be another.  However I do not know the content of your contract with the defendant that allowed you to store your valuables in his facility.  Maybe your case is in part a breach of contract case. It sounds like a failed business transaction.  Maybe it is time to be more realistic about what you can accomplish now with your scant resources  -- possibly something less than full reimbursement and being made "whole."  Saving some of your valuables might not be a bad outcome at this point.  Good luck!"43400.8277777778 I have a question that the law librarian was not able to find the answer to. I'm wondering if you could? Massachusetts civil case. Plaintiff ( me) won case VIA Court Magistrate. I received finding and an appeal in the mail. How ever a number of claims and ($1,000's) compensation were not addressed. The appeal was a carbon copy and difficult to read. I went to court house to request another legible copy. In doing so I discovered the finding was actually three pages long, not just the one I received. Three times I visited the court before finally receiving all three. By law is it mandatory for plaintiff to receive all copies of finding?In this case I discovered errors in the judgement. Example of statement finding made due to statement of a repair Not at this time". Where the Magistrate clearly took the statement as " Will ###. As well as error in ### time frame from "on going" to "recent". Two factors that weigh heavily on decision. Defendant stated reasons for appeal had already been addressed and confirmed by ### are also two false statements defendant made at the end of which I can easily prove. Due to the time laps in retrieving all copies would I still be held to the time frame in which to file for reconsideration? The court kept telling me at the appeal I will have an opportunity to bring everything before the judge. It's like a whole new hearing. Appeal ended in default and I'm told that's it case closed. Is there anything I can do at this point? I'm out thousands with only social security for income. This just seems so wrong. I appreciate any options you feel I may have or resources where I might find answers. Thank you so much. Respectfully ###P.S. Since ### Mr. ### has placed a red "X" on building claiming it's condemned.According to the town it is not.  Mr. ### has entered the building cut the lock to my storage area and left the over head door wide open. Never contacted me to do so."43390.4590277778 See above.43405.8020833333 To Attorney ###,  My apology for making this so complicated.Perhaps it's the combination of trying to be as brief as possible and my terminology is incorrect.   As I explained, we had the first hearing before a Court Magistrate which I won.Defendant was ordered to pay for a moving company to remove my property from the ### floor.  Defendant appealed.Court appeal was default by his no show. Court ordered to complete original finding of said reimbursement and the hiring of a moving  company of my choice within ### ### court date to review his finances.Neither of which were attempted.  My husband first checked with the court house clerk's office if it would be acceptable for him to stand in for due to the circumstance.He was assured it would be fine because of the type of hearing it was to be, a finance report to determine a payment schedule.  ###, defendant did appear for hearing for finance review. However he then left before case was called.That was when the judge issued what I believe wast the terminology used was ###".   There has been no verbal or written contracts between the owner manager and myself. Business was always with the manager of the buildingas a tenant at will. Manager conveniently collected rent weekly provided with a blank receipt No company name or person it was paid to. Simply my ### name date and amount. These receipts weren't excepted by the IRS as tax credit due to the lack of identification.It was the manager that allowed us o store merchandise on the ### floor in exchange for on call maintenance and repairs that had been ignored by the owner.The owner was quite aware of that bartering agreement. He never mentioned an issue with it. Basically he was a silent entity.Out of the ### ### -###. Always week days during closed hours. Once was even on the ###.  Sir if it's legally possible I can forward the court Doc. number etc. if you care to review the case via the court.        Again I apologize for the confusion and I do appreciate your opinion and advice. I have spent hours on line attempting to research each step as it comes. I easily become over whelmed with the legalwording and never ending  sections and chapters.         Sincerely               ###"43401.7458333333 I have some questions regarding video and audio surveillance by my employer in the state of Massachusetts.  This is a non profit organization donation drop off center with 10-###.  I am located in ###, Ma.  Our home office is located in Billerica, Ma.The surveillance cam that my employer has installed is a popular nanny cam called the Google Nest.  This particular camera has a tiny hidden microphone inside with no indication that it is there, including no indicator light signifying whether it is on or off.  It is controlled by an on/off toggle in a smartphone app. This app is used by many members of management.So, my questions are based on the interpretation of MGL Part IV - Title I Chapter 472 - Section ###. The intercepting devices referred to in the statute are anything â€œcapable of transmitting, receiving, amplifying or recording a wire or oral communication.â€  My interpretation is that the device should not be â€˜capableâ€™ of recording audio. I was told that the audio would be turned off in the app, but the fact is, that the microphone is still hidden inside the unit and â€˜capableâ€™ of recording.  It is not physically disabled in the unit. So, is it against the law to have this type of camera with hidden microphone in my workplace or not?  Or is it only Illegal if the audio gets turned on, making it 'risky' to my employer to have this type of system? Let's say if someone 'accidentally' toggled it on.Or, is it ok for this type of system as long as the audio is not used against anyone?Please help!  I feel like my rights and the rights of other employees and donors are being violated.Thank You.43228.8534722222 The language you are quoting from the wiretapping statute is part of the definitions section.  The relevant language you should be reading is under part C, Offences.1. Interception oral communications prohibited. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section any person who?willfully commits an interception attempts to commit an interception or procures any other person to commit an interception or to attempt to commit an interception of any wire or oral communication shall be fined not more than ten thousand dollars or imprisoned in the state prison for not more than five years or imprisoned in a jail or house of correction for not more than two and one half years or both so fined and given one such imprisonment.Proof of the installation of any intercepting device by any person under circumstances evincing an intent to commit an interception which is not authorized or permitted by this section shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this subparagraph....5. Possession of interception devices prohibited.A person who possesses any intercepting device under circumstances evincing an intent to commit an interception not permitted or authorized by this section or a person who permits an intercepting device to be used or employed for an interception not permitted or authorized by this section or a person who possesses an intercepting device knowing that the same is intended to be used to commit an interception not permitted or authorized by this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than two years or by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars or both.The installation of any such intercepting device by such person or with his permission or at his direction shall be prima facie evidence of possession as required by this subparagraph."As you can see it is not merely possessing a device that is "capable" of recording that is illegal.  If it were everybody with a smartphone in their pocket would be breaking the law.  What is illegal is possessing that device with the "intent" of illegally recording people without their knowledge.I understand the circumstance you described above to be the following: A video camera is secretly aimed at people at least some of whom are unaware of its existence.  This camera has the capability of recording audio but those operating it have pledged to only enable its video functions and to leave the audio functions turned off.If I understand your situation correctly I do not believe that any laws are being violated.  Your center has a right to use video cameras whether in plain sight or hidden.  As long as the audio remains off they are not violating any laws.  It is not illegal to use a video camera that has the capability of recording audio as long as the audio is not actually used.  Remember Massachusetts is one of only a few states with such a draconian (and in my opinion absured) wiretapping statute so in most of the rest of the country these cameras would be fully legal to use with the audio which is why they are made that way.I hope this answers your question.  Please let me know if you need further clarification."43228.8534722222 I came here as a student on ### 2014 . they gave me student visa for ### ###.

I presume that you have contact information for the police agency that seized the cash.  If it is evidence in a criminal investigation you may not get the money back until the case is completed, if at all. You may also sue the department in small claims court if  the amount of cash was less than $###, for the damages you suffered as a result of the seizure of the money.  If there is any procedure established within the department for the recovery of seized ### you should investigate that as well.  YOu haven't provided the name of the agency so I can't do any research to determine whether there is an easily discovered internal procedure.  You'll need to look it up yourself or contact the police agency.Good luck.44113.4819444444 In March of. This year I had arrived at my brothers home and shortly after police raided it. They confiscated my phone and some cash I had on hand, however I was not arrested or detained or anything. When I contacted them to get my property back they gave me my phone but wonâ€™t give me my cash back. How should I handle this? 44112.6979166667 A lawsuit was filed against me for defaulting on a ### truck lease, due to health and breadowns ( documented) Even though I reached out to the creditor  ### Loan Mountain and asked them to work with us, they refused, this was March. The creditor refused to accept  partial payments  last was ###. While communicating that I can pay off the note (###, which is ### 42) if I come up with ###, the Creditor went ahead and filed a civil lawsuit with a prejudgment replevin request.I learned about this law suit (filed ###) because I received a letter form an attorney offering to represent me, I researched online in the county records and l also learned that a prejudgment replevin was  not only requested with the complaint but in fact signed and ordered by the judge (###). This was ###.I called the court the very same day because I could not understand why was I not notified of anything? At first she said it too late, then she verified that there was no service response, that I was not served. I asked her what ca I do, this is not fair why am I not allowed to defend myself and the clerk told me that I can file some kind of  answer to this. I filed a motion for reconsideration this past monday ###. I have never done anything like this and I dont know if thats enough.TODAY, which 10/###. I have not been allowed my right to respond in any shape or form , doesnt this violate my rights? The clerk was surprised that no service was done. I was stripped of my ability to answer both the law suit and the replevin what can I do? I have included the Complaint and my Motion for Reconsideration. 44112.8770833333 I don't believe the reconsideration is what is needed. You want to file a Motion to Set Aside Judgment for lack of service.  As to what you did file, it isn't in proper format. It appears more like a letter. You didn't entitle it what it is, the paragraphs aren't numbered as they should be and you didn't specifically ask for relief wanted.  I don't see a certificate of service showing that you served the other party and you would never thank a judge in a motion.  Please refer to flcourts.org for a template for motions and file a proper motion. 44113.5458333333 ###.  I am very sorry you and your family are in this sever financial bind.###.  However, it is far too late in the day to file a motion to dismiss for failure to serve you sooner than they did.###.  Why? Because you have know about this problem since ###. Courts will not dismiss an ongoing action for the reason you are asking.  ###.  Having said that, you have done well by responding to the belated service; your heart-felt lengthy explanation of your family's situation--especially by informing the Judge that you are within sight (only nine payments left) of your original goal to purchase the semi--should be well worth the effort. 5. Suggestion: Since you have been (and probably still are) in active settlement discussions you should consider drafting a motion to continue the replevin proceedings.6. In your motion you should tell the judge that you and the plaintiff's lawyer have been in active negotiations to settle this case amicably, without need for any hearings.7. ###: You CANNOT tell the judge anything factual about the discussions--because settlement negotiations are confidential and cannot be admitted. 8. Your motion to continue should be VERY short and straight to the point; judges love to hear that the parties are negotiating settlement and will probably grant the motion. 9. It would also help enormously if you get a cashier's check for $###5,###'s office and ask them to help you deposit it into the registry of the court."

She told me that also I was going to be on the lease , but she ended up changing her mind so I felt used and played. Anyone in my position will feel the same way, are you a lawyer? Itâ€™s basically a long story but basically I let her borrow money from me and I again I thought I was going to stay with her for another year but it ended up not happening.

You will probably need to prove that you left the premises early due to some breach of the agreement on her part and not that you changed your mind or had some other personal reason for leaving early.You can sue her in small claims court for the amount you claim is owed.  However, you should be aware that suing her, if you win, will only get you a judgment for the $###.

The burden of proof is on you to show that it is stalking, harassing and dangerous for you and the others you list.  Live testimony of you and the others is evidence.  I always caution clients however.  Restraining orders are paper and some people won't abide by them regardless.  Not to discourage you at all, just so you know.

I currently have a federal lawsuit pending against members of the local sheriff's department. On ###, my German Shepperd puppy was stolen. A deputy went against standard procedure per Florida statutes and gave my puppy to the woman that had her. The woman stated the deputy claimed I was a transient and could not care for the dog and she could have it. Standard procedure IF the dog was in fact neglected would have been to contact animal control and issue me some sort of citation with information on how to recover my pet NOT give her to a random stranger who took her over four hours away. I have tried everything I can think of to recover my pet. What can I do? Legally what can be done to the woman that took her and the deputy that gave her permission to keep her?44126.5555555556 The lawsuit is the appropriate forum to have this matter addressed.44126.6645833333 We seem to have a judge in Orange County that signs every ex parte that comes across his desk because he's afraid someone might commit suicide. It says right on mine that we were estranged since February so why was it filed in October. Is this legal? and what can I do about i  because that happened to me I was working as a census worker and was prevented from working because my ex-husband forced my daughter who is yes an adult along with his fraud department officer pressured her into finally make false ex parte on me due to the fact I have filed police reports on him for abuse cyberstalking for over ###.I was filing a report when I was taken I was kept for six days and not five ###.Is this even legal?My my HIPAA was violated twice during this fiasco.They let my ### know when I got out.I had repeatedly told them I did not want them called and was assured by five different people five staff members text nurses and therapists they cannot be contacted it was illegal.What I believe happened is that my ex called or had my daughter call and he probably filmed her or recorded her to tape her committing a crime he may be a sociopath. I believe that my ex or she called saying that it was an ex parte and they had the right to know if I was released like they would have if there had been a protection order in place but there wasn't it never has been. They actually wrote it in the files in my medical records that they called them.IS THIS LEGAL!!??I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO CHOOSE OR PROTECTIVE ### EVEN THOUGH MY OWN WERE IN THIS PLACE  NO ### WERE PROVIDED NO DAILY SANITATION NO SANITATION AFTER EACH USE OF A BATHROOM OR SHOWER WE WERE TREATED AS LESS THAN ANIMALS.NO ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE FOR ANY KIND OF VISITATION NOR WAS IT OFFERED.

Our children are 15/### 6. Only the youngest is legal (USC). i am super worried that immigration is gonna knock at our door And take us into custody and the kids I donâ€™t know where. i have a sister in Texas and my mom who has Alzheimer is living with her. I was hoping laws may change after election because if I leave I wonâ€™t be able to take care of my mom and my sister is in bad health ( heart issues and diabetes). is there a way to know if immigration was called on us ? And what should we do to avoid being held into custody thanks a lot for your help 44129.6263888889 Unfortunately there is no way to know at this point if immigration was called on you unless you were already in deportation proceedings which you would be aware because ICE or Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) would have served you with paperwork.  If they were in fact called, ICE , CBP, or a local law enforcement agency who was granted immigration enforcement were to show up at your house to detain you or your family, do not speak to them.  They often times will ask you information about yourself and do not answer any questions, you have that right.  A response of what country you were born, that you overstayed a visa, or that you are currently undocumented, will be used against you if you volunteer that information.  You may want to look into having an immigration attorney available in case you or your family were to be apprehended by ICE.  If they do detain you, go willingly otherwise you could face criminal charges which would be detrimental to any claim you may have to stay in the United Stated. Unfortunately during these times, my advice at this point would be to lay low and try to avoid any interaction with law enforcement or where your ID would be scanned.44133.8527777778
