How would I go about making this change without an attorney or would it be in my best interest to hire one? 43636.7583333333 My ex sister-in-law and her family still have personal property that belonged to my deceased parents.  Including a vehicle.  I have tried to get these items back without luck.  They live in the state of Kentucky.  I live in the state of North Carolina.  I have lots of emails and other documentation where I have tried to get the items back.  Way too much to include in this request.  I have exhausted all of the avenues I know of.  Any help is greatly appreciated.43637.73125 The car is a very different issue from the other tangible personal property because it has a title.  Do you know where the title is and are you sure it is in the name of one or both of your parents. There must be a current registration, license and insurance for it to be legally driven.  How long has it been since your parents died? Was there a will and has an estate been opened?  If an estate is open there is an Executor and you know who the heirs are.  The Executor has a legal right to the vehicle and the police help with recovery of stolen vehicles.  This is a documentation issue -- owners on the title, legal authority through an estate of someone to act, and then enforcement of those rights.The rest of the items are much harder because there is not any good way to prove ownership.  If there is something of great value, you might work on developing some proof of ownership, such as purchase or insurance records.  But with the things being in another state and subject to dispute over the actual owner, you are much less likely to be successful.43654.8381944444 If you have not already done so, I recommend that you contact the Child Protective Services (CPS") unit of the Department of Social Services  ("DSS")in the County where your daughter and her children live.  While I don't know enough about the facts of the case to say whether your daughter is an unfit mother your description of her behaviors  makes it sound like she  neglects her children.  when you call DSS be sure to let them know that you are the maternal grandmother of the minor children and that you are ready willing and able to provide a home for the children.Once you have called DSS they have a statutory duty to investigate the situation and if they deem it necessary DSs can take emergency custody of the  children.

ASAP43640.68125 Good afternoon, Mrs. ###:Thank you for this very important question; I also hope the summer is going well for you, your husband and your family.  You will need to review the trust instrument very carefully on this, but generally the answer to your question is no.  Trust instruments that are well-drafted by estate planning legal counsel usually contained precise provisions as to what trustees can delegate and to whom, but this does not authorize ### to act as ### with respect to the trust.  You have to follow the ### instructions very carefully in order to avoid a situation in which your brother could credibly challenge your right to remain as co-trustee in a proceeding before the New ### County Clerk of Court, or Superior Court.  If your settlor did not authorize you to ### a proxy, you should absolutely stay away from this.In situations like yours, it can be a very helpful thing to have a seasoned estate planning lawyer review the trust instrument in order to provide you a detailed answer that is precisely tailored to the instrument in question.  I feel confident in the feedback I have provided, but I do offer the ### that I lack the benefit of having read the trust instrument in its entirety.I would first re-read the instrument with the concerns you raised here in mind, then consult with an estate planning lawyer if you desire further discussion about how to handle ongoing ### with your brother.  Perhaps reducing some of your communications to emails and formal letters will alleviate (although probably not altogether remove) certain interpersonal conflicts.  I am highly sy###hetic to your concerns, as I see this dynamic often in the ### planning aspect of my practice.God bless you and your family this summer.  I sincerely wish you an improvement to this situation.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43659.7520833333 I was recently named as a co-trustee of a family trust. I'm not knowledgeable about finances, taxes, or legal issues, and I'm struggling with managing my responsibilities. Furthermore, the situation has created a lot of tension in my family because my brother is the other co-trustee, and we frequently disagree about administration of the trust. While I intend to continue as a trustee, I'd like someone else to manage the communication with my co-trustee brother and my family (who are all also beneficiaries.) Ideally, I would choose either a financial advisor or attorney, or possibly my husband (who is more capable of understanding the ### of the assets.)The trust explicitly describes the succession of trustees: if I resign or am incapacitated, my brother becomes sole trustee. Therefore, I'd like to maintain the position and my duties, and manage the situation while delegating some of the tasks to others who can perform them more ### than I. Am I legally permitted to use an agent or proxy for this purpose?43640.8506944444 I am married to a man that has abused me as well as drugs. He is a convicted felon and is in prison now until ###. We have been separated for over a year now since December of ###017. I have low income and a single mom of ###. All I want to do is get a ### for separation.

Potentially having to move away for financial reasons to live with parents in Florida.  What are the custody laws for an unmarried couple with a child 43641.5875 My husband of ###. He has been the sole provider for our family for the last five years while I was a stay at home mother to our now five year old son. Obviously in the state of NC we have to be legally separated for a year to divorce, the problem poses with who leaves the house and who gets what in the separation/divorce. He says because I had no income for the last five years while he paid the mortgage that I am not entitled to the house or any part of the equity.. the car that was bought for me and I have been driving for the last five years is also registered in his name. Really I would like to know what I am entitled to and what I can do here. I don't have much of a savings or income to show for the time dedicated to our child but I am working now. In order to start over I feel like I need some of what we both worked to build over the last ###. My other question is in order to start the separation one of us has to leave. If I were the one to do so, would he be able to claim that I have abandoned the home and then be allowed to give me nothing out of it? He does have proof of me cheating on him from over a year ago however there is also a history of abuse towards me on his part. I really would just like to move forward with my life at this point and would like to know all my possible options and what I am entitled to. Any advice is greatly appreciated.43641.7208333333 Her mother died of a drug overdose and my daddy was murdered on ###. And the grandmother will not communicate with us so that we can see her.

Child was conceived prior to the father's marriage with the stepmother.A minor child (the father's niece) was presented to my residence stating that the father of my child was in the vehicle and wanted to take him for the day (###). Once I allowed my child to go to the vehicle, the stepmother was the only adult in the vehicle and not the child's father. I did not give the stepmother permission to take my child.

I have always allowed the father complete and unrestricted access to our minor child. Father is not on child support. There were no prior issues with visitation arrangements prior to this incident.I have limited income and I have been the sole provider for the child since his birth. He lives in my household and has been living with me since his birth. I am concerned that the father will not return my child to my residence unless ordered by the legal system. I feel helpless because I have never been away from my child without any form of communication for this long. How do I get my child to be immediately returned to my household?43642.0708333333 I have been taking care of my god Child for the past four years since he was ten months old. I received a safety agreement for him when he was ten months old. The mother was in a Situation pretaining to her and the father which the father is currently incarcerated. The mother was placed under investigation by child Protected services. Recently I contacted child Protected services and they told me that the safety agreement was void when they closed the child case with the mother in ###. Which, I have asked child Protected services for help and they said it's nothing they can do and the only best option I have is to take the mother to court. In which she agrees to turning over her Rights but doesn't want to go into court. Every since then the child has been living in my home with me. The mother is currently and still running around wild due to her being substance abused to drugs and is unstable to take care of him. I have a power of attorney to only make sure he makes his doctors appointments. Now, I am willing to pursue further into obtaining full custody due to having to deal with so from the mother not cooperating with me or even trying to provide for him. What Are The Proper steps Of Going About This Situation? Can I get paperwork online that can be used in court ?How long do the process takes for me to obtain custody of him? Is There Other alternatives to take to handle it outside of court ?43642.8631944444 I have left my husband over ###.

I need help please43647.5972222222 Ms. ###:You ask a very thoughtful question, and I appreciate your asking it in this forum.  I think that based on your description of this situation, the answer is likely yes, under N.C.G.S.Â§ ###-###03(1) and (###).  I would start by consulting for a brief ### ### ###--with a family law attorney in ### County, just to confirm that my thinking along the lines of the statute herein cited is correct.  If you had permission in the course of a Florida custody proceeding to move to North Carolina with your child, and you and the child have truly established your domicile in North Carolina, it is likely that a North Carolina court would have authority to modify whatever order was in effect in Florida.  However, the details of your situation can lead to different interpretations by a Florida lawyer retained by the other parent domiciled there, so the first step in your strategy is to make sure, with NC local ### help, that you have done all the things in showing your intent to permanently remain in NC, so as to persuade a ### County District Court judge that s/he has the statutory authority under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###-### (assuming you also abide by ### notice requirements for serving out-of-state opposing parties, which is also covered under N.C.G.S. Chapter ###.  If there is any potential weaknesses in your case on this jurisdictional question, I am sure that your local lawyer in ### County would be able to identify them for you during your initial consultation.  Here is the statutory provision I was referencing: https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_###/GS_###-###03.pdf .Contact a local family law attorney when you have a chance to discuss this more thoroughly.  I hope you can soon solidify your position so that your new life in western North Carolina will be that much more productive and fulfilling, with greater peace of mind for both you and your child.  I wish the best of blessings to you both.Be well,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43689.9111111111 My son and I currently live in North Carolina.

It depends of what type of papers you are talking about, and it depends on whether you are the Plaintiff or the Defendant.  If you are talking about the Civil Summons and you are the Plaintiff, then your attorney can put your name in care of the attorney's address.  If you are talking about the Civil Summons and you are the Defendant, then your complete name and address must appear so that service" can be perfected at the proper address unless you are accepting service and then it can be left off.

My attorney claimed he had an attorney but, never told me her name , address or anything.  My attorney said that my husband attorney wanted ### to rescind divorce papers.  He I signed some more papers and now I have to wait till ### for my attorney to go to court.  Is it legal that I have to wait this long and the the judge can tell me to communicate with my husband. My husband is a big liar and I donâ€™t want to hear his lies anymore because it is insulting to me that he thinks Iâ€™m that dumb to believe him anymore.  The judge saw with her own eyes that my husband signed and bought a car with his girlfriend while we were married but, pretended like she believed him.  It was in black and white.  I know I could have gotten another ### and appealed.  Neither of the attorneys I had wanted to help me.  My husband and his family paid their way all through the whole thing instead if the judge doing the right thing when she knows right from wrong.  After all of this,  I should be able to move on and get the divorce right.43659.6159722222 I'm sorry ma'am.  I looked at the court papers you attached but did not see where your name and address was listed.43663.7673611111 These are my court papers43659.6180555556 You might not see it but, i have a copy of it sent to be by email.  My name and address is the only thing on there.  My husband address, my attorney address or his address is on there.  My name and address is the only thing on there maâ€™am.  Iâ€™m sure that is not right.  All I want to know is is that right or fair.  Iâ€™m sure legally it is not. He has paid everyone and do I have rights.  The judge knows right from wrong and everyone else does 43672.8055555556 i want to know if my attorney has to put my name and address on court papers where my husband can see.  The my attorney did not put my husbandâ€™s information or address down.  My attorney represents my.  I had an attorney before him and she put her information down along with my name.  Never my address.  Also,  I believe my husband is talking with my attorney.  I know I have no proof but I want my divorce over and done with.  My husband and I have been separated sine ###.  Iâ€™ve done everything legally to get divorced.  Please let me know what I can do to end this process. The judge has written something on our court papers stating my husband and I communicate with each other.  Is that legal. The papers I submitted were and are not what Iâ€™m pertaining to.  It is the last paperwork filed. My attorney put my name and my name only on court papers 43648.49375 my wife took out a restraining order I found out she is on drugs how can I file for emergency custody?43650.0291666667 Also in terms of my financial means, I have been a full time college student since 2016, gave birth to son in 2017, and I am still in college full time. I have financially provided primarily myself since I gave birth to my son. The financial aid paid for housing, bills, and baby necessities. I could not pay for daycare alone so I could not work. Now I am working from home part time. 43650.25625 I already have primary custody. In a temporary custody order agreed upon in our 1st and 2nd mediation. We are coming up on our 3rd mediation in which he wants to request full custody. So is the only solution to make our custody order as detailed as possible? Because we don't get along and I left due to neglect and domestic violence. I did not report violence when I left but I did report assault when my child was ### old. He was intoxicated and had to take AA and anger management. Its very hard to talk to him but I go to counseling and think of my child to push through and talk to him but I get anxiety when I do. 43655.8131944444 If you contact the courthouse, you may be able to get a motion to waive mediation, and cite domestic violence as the reason.  If the judge grants the motion, then you would not have to mediate any further.  The case would then go to trial.If you do end up ###, you are entitled to refuse any demand of his, as he is entitled to not agree to your demands.  It would then end up in a trial.43655.8222222222 Okay thank you.43655.825 The custody case is high conflict or at least to my opinion. The father of my child has been stuck on the fact that I left him when I was three months pregnant. He believes that since I left him and moved a hour and a half away that I should be responsible for transportation. He complains about this all the time even though I am not financially able to assist with transportation. He agreed to be responsible for picking up and dropping off in the custody order. Long story short, he feels I am not helping him enough and is now wanting full custody because he believes I will be forced to help him once he does. I have asked him to do family counseling with me and he refuses. He consistency belittles me saying I'm not doing a good job because I have to ask him for help. He does not participate in doctor appointments. He refused to help pay for things saying because of child support prior to actually being on child support.  Can I get sole custody due to not being able to effectively coparent and constant changes to custody order?43650.2472222222 The judge may factor in the reason for the move, but that is not a guarantee.  Most likely, the judge will want to know who is best able to care for the child, and will attempt to craft a sharing schedule, factoring in the distance.Given the distance, one of you will likely end up with primary custody, and the other with secondary custody.  Full shared custody would be difficult, given the distance.  Based on what you have described, neither of you has acted in a way to lose custody or to gain sole custody.43655.7868055556 I am sorry you are going through this.  I understand your concern.  Unfortunately, your mother is an adult so you cannot force her to seek medical attention.  It does not sound like her behavior is life threatening so it probably will not do any good to contact the Adult Protective Services of your local Department of Social Services. In the event her behavior truly does become life threatening to either her or the children, you should contact DSS.

Yes, you will definitely need to put this in writing, and you will also wish to have family law counsel draft the agreement, which will likely need to be incorporated as part of either a consent decree or binding court order in a child custody proceeding in Wake County District Court.

I truly need help and advice. 43655.0152777778 There are actually several issues involved in your question which would require a full consultation to properly address.  One issue is the equitable distribution of marital property.  All property acquired during the marriage, except for inheritances and gifts, is marital property and is subject to division, typically 50/50.  Assuming your house was acquired during the marriage, for instance, it would be marital property subject to division, no matter whose name is on the deed.  The same would be true regarding vehicles acquired during the marriage as well as bank and retirement accounts (even if they are separate).Your question also raises the issue of alimony.  Alimony is what one spouse might owe the other to support the other spouse according to the accustomed standard of living in the years prior to separation.  In order to be eligible for alimony, a spouse must be dependent on the other spouse's income to meet their own, personal needs.  If that is true, they are generally eligible for alimony.  If the other spouse has engaged in an ### ### affair, that automatically entitles a dependent spouse to alimony (so long as the dependent spouse has not herself engaged in an ### ### affair).I hope this helps.  Best of luck to you.43704.6798611111 Ms. ###,Thank you for contacting NC Free Legal Answers. I would like to make sure that I understand your circumstances correctly. Is there currently a custody agreement in place? If there is no custody agreement, the parent who is in possession of the child has custody of the child and makes decisions about where the child lives.However, the court will do what is in the best interests of the child. Considering the information you have provided, if there is a custody agreement, you may seek to have the agreement modified. If the court determines your stepdaughter has sufficient mental capacity and comprehension to give a well thought out opinion about where she wants to live, then court will consider her opinion when making its decision.You mentioned you went to the courthouse. What was the purpose and outcome of that proceeding? 43697.0680555556 Myself and my husband is trying to get custody of his ###.

How can I file for a simple divorce?43656.6590277778 There are residency requirements" to meet before you are entitled to use the court system.  If you are not a resident of North Carolina you cannot file your divorce action in North Carolina.  If you have been residing in Iowa for the last ### then you can file the divorce action in Iowa based on Iowa laws.  I hope this helps."43663.8277777778 Hello!It has come to my attention that I have two recognized" names in NC -- my birth name ### ### ### and my married name ### ### ###. When I was married ### I applied for a new Social Security card with my married name requesting to drop "###" and received it. My driver's license was also updated to reflect this name change. I have been under the assumption that those two actions made my legal name ### ### ### up until my husband and I recently adopted two children from the foster care system in Wake County. At that time we discovered that Vital Records still reflects my name as ### ### ### (surname ###) and that only a court order can allow them to remove ###. Back in 2006 however neither the Social Security Administration or the DMV asked for a court order showing that I "dropped" ###. Currently I have all government issued IDs (Real ID driver's license Social Security card and passport) under my presumed legal name of ### ### ###. I've not encountered any issues with my name until we filed the adoption petition last spring and now with our subsequent request for new birth certificates for our adopted children. Based on all of this I would like some legal advice on how to proceed. From what I understand if I remove ### from my name with a court order this will also change my original birth certificate (which I would not want to happen) but it would then allow my legal name to match what is currently on all of my identification. Do I have a legal obligation to proceed with the court order given that the government recognizes me as ### ### ###? If there is no legal obligation are there any future consequences of not pursuing the court order?Thank you so much for your time!(###) ### ### ###"43656.9472222222 I can certainly understand your confusion and frustration.  BTW congratulations on your adoption proceeding!!!  In North Carolina, you can change your name by marriage without having a formalized name change action filed (which would also change your birth" name).  Actually you were lucky because NOW you can't drop your first name and use just your middle name with your new married name without a formal name change action.  If you truly (permanently) want to drop any part of your birth name it must be by a complete name change proceeding filed with the Clerk of Superior Court.  Otherwise it is simply the "allowance" of North Carolina to change your name (without a filed action) because of your marriage.  It is also why you have a much simpler time changing your name back to your birth name and a few other options in the event of divorce without having to go through a complete name change action and again getting a new birth certificate.  When you mentioned "Vital Records that is your Birth Certificate.  You only get a new Birth Certificate after a formal name change action as I have mentioned.  Your legal name is the one you are using.  There is nothing you need to do.43657.8506944444 Quite frankly, this is the first and ONLY time I have ever heard of someone having a problem with the process that has been around longer than you and I have been a live.  I am not surprised that DSS does not understand, however, I am shocked that the Clerk of Court does not understand.  Again, most people drop the middle name - not the first name when they convert to a marital name.  I did the very same thing.  I have not used the first name on my Birth Certificate in ### birth name" which if I recall has only been twice in my life and created no misunderstanding whatsoever. I regret this ### your adoption process.  Hopefully the completion of this one will pave the way for a ### second time around.  God Bless."43658.1229166667 Thank you SO much for your quick response and the congratulations on our adoption! Based on the information you provided, I have a couple of follow-up questions. Given that ###, I wasn't required to do a formal name change, what documentation should I provide in the future to prove my name change was legitimate under the NC allowance? With our adoption experience last year, DSS and the Clerk of Court repeatedly requested the court order, even though I let them know I had not gone through that process. In the end, they made what appeared to be an exception for our case given that I had a Social Security card and driver's license with the name I used to file the petition (### ### ###). In their eyes, ### ### ###" and "### ### ###" were two different people. This significantly delayed our adoption process and as we're considering adopting again in the future we'd like to avoid that confusion if at all possible! Also is there any other instance now or in the future when I would need to recognize ### as my first given name (forms documents etc.)? Are there other situations in which the discrepancy and lack of court order could cause difficulty? Thank you again for your time!"43657.9118055556 This is such a relief! I had to laugh at your response because our family tends to find ourselves in these first and only" "rare and unique" type of situations quite often. I will add this one to the list!

This man is NOT listed on the birth certificate, because we were separated the month my son was conceived (2016), due to domestic violence. I was in a new relationship. Now, he is trying to go after me for sole custody, after he tried to rape me in March. I am not even 100% certain that my ex is this childâ€™s father. I canâ€™t afford a lawyer, as I am currently preparing for a new child, due in August and unemployed. How should I proceed with replying to these papers? 43657.8395833333 Do you dispute the validity of the DNA mouth swab test?  If not, and if you are fine accepting the financial support, and if you are ok allowing visitation, then i don't see a problem with an agreement allowing visitation.  If you dispute that he is the father, then i'm not sure why you are allowing visitation and accepting financial support. In that scenario, ask for another DNA test.  43704.7270833333 When my daughter was two weeks old, the alleged father of my child brought over a mouth swab DNA test. The swabs were sent off and the results came back positive. There were no witnesses. I called the company that issued the test and asked if the test would hold up in a court of law and they said it would not. During the time that I was pregnant it was well known that he may not be the father. A few weeks ago I was served papers stating that I was unreasonably denying him visitation and wanted full custody, claiming that I was fit and proper to have visitation. I filed my answer with the Clerk of Court and sent one to his attorney stating that I have never withheld visitation and that I was the fit and proper person to have full custody of the minor child. I have paid for consults and I've hit a dead end almost everywhere because, although I am taking complete care of my child by myself, I can not afford an attorney. The alleged father helps pay for child care and that is all. We had mediation orientation today, and the orientation is scheduled for ###th. Basically, I am in ### that this would be allowed to happen without a court ordered DNA test. As I have asked around I was told that I should have mentioned that in my response to the papers I was served. I know that we will not come to an agreement and the temporary custody hearing is on ###th. Is there a way that I can amend my answer and include that I am uncomfortable with the proceedings and ask for a legally binding DNA test? Or do I have to file a motion with the courthouse for a legal DNA test?

I43658.6930555556 Thank you for your question. I am sorry that you are in this situation. If you were to pursue divorce, the court would divide your house/property (which may require a sale of the property with the money from the sale being split between the two of you). If you are able to get a protection order, you can ask the judge to order that your husband be required to stay away from your home. However, protection orders are usually temporary and so if you want a more permanent solution then you may have to file for divorce.Legal Aid of North  Carolina offers free seminars to help people learn how to file for divorce on their own, without the need to hire a lawyer. You can learn more here: ###. If you wish to hire a lawyer to represent you in divorce, you may wish to contact the Lawyer Referral Service at ###-### and ask for the name of a family law attorney.

He then took and hid our son in a different state.

At the time, I was in the process of becoming a real estate appraiser and I had just finished taking my classes and was going to begin looking for a job in a few months after my apartment lease ran out. My ex girlfriend knew that I was working on switching professions, which would entail me taking a drastically lower paying salary while I trained for this new profession. I texted her my plan to switch jobs before she became pregnant and I still have proof of this. Immediately after she gave birth, she filed for child support while I was still working at my higher paying job and we went to court for temporary child support, which was based on my higher paying job at that time. About ###, I was hired to be a trainee real estate appraiser. About ###, I was laid off of this job due to the company ###.All of this occurred before we went back to court to make custody and child support permanent. I know that before I was laid off, she was going to try to impute my income to have child support based off of what I made at my previous job, even though she knew that I was intending on taking a temporary pay cut to enter a new field. I don't know if it is even possible for court to impute my income at this point since I have been laid off due to no fault of my own. I plan on taking another trainee job that will probably make a comparable salary. Would a judge have legal standing to impute my income to the higher paying salary after being laid off if I take another job making a comparable salary?  Or would the judge have to base child support on my real wages?43661.7930555556 My daughter is 10. Her father has never been around, never paid child support. ### the birth certificate.

To win an alienation of affections claim, you must show the following in court: (###) the existence of a marriage marked by genuine love and affection (although not perfect) between the spouses; (###) an intentional or malicious act by a third party (paramour or other party) that interferes in the marriage; and (###) destruction of the love and affections of the marriage.  Obviously, you can show (###), and whether (###) exists depends in part on whether the third party has deliberately sought to end or disrupt your marriage (likely, you can prove this too).  What remains to be examined is whether (###) is satisfied, because in order to show this, you must show that your marriage has been destroyed.  So if you and your wife reconcile without divorcing, or somehow move past this incident with your feelings for each other intact, you cannot show that your love and affections have actually be destroyed."  However if your marriage ends because of this person you can definitely show that (###) exists.### will generally be inferred by a ### if the unfaithful spouse and the third party engaged in sexual intercourse although not all ### according to law is necessarily sexual in nature.The other related tort clai###ainst people like this would be "criminal conversation which is simply sex with the spouse of another.  This can be proven with circumstantial evidence, and does not strictly require direct evidence.Even if you decide not to sue the third party, you could possibly use this as leverage in negotiating a good separation agreement or divorce terms should you file for divorce.  If you decide to divorce, you need to hire a local family law attorney, who may or may not be willing to also sue for alienation of affections and/or criminal conversation should the facts so warrant.  If not, you would need to hire a civil litigation lawyer separately, to sue the third party once the divorce is complete.Given the ### atmosphere of ### County, you might consider searching for lawyers in some of the neighboring or nearby counties, just to keep your options open.God bless you as you work through this difficult time.  I wish you the very best this summer.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43674.0104166667 Had a great marriage other than occasional lack of money until her new boyfriend whose office is next door to her job started stalking her going to her job every day giving her gifts that I couldnâ€™t afford and making promises to her about the great life they could have she turned ###â€™m drowning 43668.6951388889 I have been raising my stepson since he was one, and he is turning nine soon. He has never had any contact with his biological father. His biological father pays child support but he has not paid in ###, and pays a really low amount. We live in NC and my sonâ€™s biological father is in SC. My stepson wants our last name because he currently has my wifeâ€™s maiden name (her fatherâ€™s last name). We do no need any financial assistance and he has never had any contact with our son. My questions are:If we take him off of child support while he is already ### (excluding previous payment issues), Can we file for adoption under the abandonment rule? Would we have a good case now if we filed for adoption, considering he has not made a payment since ### and has never had any contact with my stepson? He has never had any physical contact with our son, and stopping child support will cut off any financial issues as well. At this point, we want to move on as a family, cut ties, and change my ### last name so he feels included without the chance of a stranger randomly showing up and confusing a happy child. 43668.9805555556 I have filed the petition. I did some digging around and found where the bio dad is staying. He has two rule to vacate cases so far this year. One was on ###, and it is currently open in server status. It allowed me to find his address. I sent a certified letter that he signed, confirming that he received it. That will be my proof to the judge that he is aware of the special proceedings. I have to turn in three notarized character reference letters, along with the birth and marriage certificate. I have asked that the home study be waived since I have been married to my spouse for more than two years.  I have done much research as well as ### with two attorneys to prepare. With that said, I still have a few questions:Will one certified letter of summons and phone records be sufficient or should I send more to ensure the judges approval with my efforts?Should I bring up the bio dads unstable financial situation considering he has two rule to vacate cases this year? (More in previous years)Will the clerk of court let me know if he responds to the letter considering I am representing myself? What usually happens after ###. Thanks for answering my questions. I am very anxious waiting for time to pass. I appreciate it. 43687.9284722222 We spoke with a lawyer in North Carolina. We donâ€™t have to use any adoption agencies because weâ€™ve been married for over ###. The lawyer says the bio dads rights can be terminated due to being proven unfit and abandonment due to never having any physical contact. We asked him to consent and sign. He agreed but never showed to get it notarized. We would need to pay ### to terminate rights and adopt. I cross reference the lawyers point of view and another lawyer told me that we canâ€™t terminate rights based on unfit parent and abandonment bc he still pays court ordered child support regardless of it being on time. Before spending ### I want to know if we have a shot of termination and adoption. Also, can we be appointed an attorney or possible represent ourselves in the proceedings? 43682.6222222222 While the Bio Dad is behind on his child support might be the perfect time to ask him if he will sign a Consent to Adopt form allowing you to adopt the child.  If he agrees and does so, this could soon allow him to be relieved of any future child support payments.  This is a much quicker and less expensive way to adopt the child without having to go through a complete termination of parental rights action based on abandonment.  You can get a Consent to Adopt form (and all other forms) from the Office of the Clerk of Superior Court in the county where you live.  Good luck!43675.0763888889 Will it require a notary or is it paperwork that we can simply get him to sign if he agrees to meet up with us and end his rights. I found out that my benefits at work will pay for 25% of any court costs. I am thinking of letting a lawyer handle the issue but we would love to not have the financial burden of going that route. Should I try contacting the biological dad first or should we let the lawyer do that for us. We donâ€™t want to be blackmailed or in a situation where this all ### on us. 43675.1180555556 Yes, this document must be signed in the presence of a Notary Public.  Yes, I believe it would be best if your wife (not you) contacted Bio Dad.  Remember that presentation is important.  Do not present this document as ending his rights." Present it as a way to "end his obligation."  I would also recommend that you read carefully the provisions of your work place benefits.  Court costs are extremely minimal in an adoption case - around $120.00.  It's the home evaluation fees and attorney fees that mount up.  Why hire a lawyer? The lawyer knows which documents to file and when and (important) what to say and NOT say during filing and the Hearing. "43675.675 You are not entitled to a Court Appointed lawyer in this type of action.  You can always represent yourself if you know what you are doing.  I have already addressed that issue.  Abandonment would include non payment of child support for at least ###.  If you have received anything at all (Money, postcard, telephone call, etc) then the child is not abandoned.  I would press again for having him sign the Consent Form.  You might want to have the completed form in the courtroom with you on his court date for failure to pay support.  Check first and find out which courthouse personnel are Notaries so that you can walk him into that person's office with the form for him to sign.  It may take a few tries but you will be saving $### and about ###.43682.8701388889 I am trying to obtain custody of my children bit im stumped on what route i should take.

Only the state where the children have most recently for ###.  In your situation, that sounds like it is North Carolina.  If so, you may file a custody action in ### County.  A judge in ### County could then issue an order that a judge in Michigan would be required to obey.  In fact, a judge in ### County would be authorized to enter an emergency custody order if the father absconded with the children.  There are typically self-help packets available to people like you in the clerk's office.Hope this helps and good luck.43704.6965277778 My kids father took my kids to MI and he filled for papers to keep them.

A parentâ€™s custody rights do not depend on payment of child support. However, the court will always do what is in the best interests of the child and may consider ability to pay child support as part of its determination as to whether a parent is able to act in the childâ€™s best interests. If you have been ordered to pay child support, you are obligated to do so and should continue to do so.If you are willing to answer a few more questions about your circumstances, I might be able to provide you with more information. Are you recognized as a legal parent of the children-  your name is on the birth certificate? Is there a custody agreement in place? You mention your parentsâ€™ home, is the mother of your children alleging that your parentsâ€™ home is not a safe place for your children?I hope this helps. Thank you for reaching out.43704.0847222222 Thank you for sending the additional information. I wanted to confirm whether or not you are the legal parent. It sounds like you are and that means you and the mother have equal rights to the children, if there is no custody order in place. If you are not able to work out an agreement for visitation with the mother of your children, you may want to consider filing a custody/visitation action and seeking the assistance of the court to obtain a custody order. A judge would help decide who has physical care of the children, who makes major decisions, and set a visitation schedule to ensure you are able to spend time with your children. If the mother of your children violates the custody order, you could seek further assistance from the court.Documenting your efforts is a good idea. You could also make note of the dates that you attempted to contact and/or visit your children in case you decide to go forward with the custody order.Legal Aid of NC has instructions on their website for filing a custody action. If you wish to pursue that, please see http://www.legalaidnc.org/get-help/self-help-clinics/child-custody-and-visitation43705.0625 Yes I am on the birth cerificate of ###. I have not had my daughter over at my house for more than a year now and I have had no contact with her either the reason is because the mother states that my mothers house is to small to have her here. When my daughter did come over she slept in the same room as me since I only have the one room and so did my boys. They are all smaller children so I have ### ###. I had to drop this off at her house on Friday night so she could give to my kids I have attached a photo I had to call my mom and let her know that I had put the money and cards in a bag the third photo did not attach. And I plan on giving her more cash on Friday plus the childsupport they are already taking out of my check. I am currently seeking for a place to live to see if she will let me see my kids but I feel like she will not even if I do what she asks. At this point I am desperate and I need help seeing my kids.43704.0986111111 Hi, my name is ### ###. I am inquiring about custody of my ###.  There father falsified information when he filed to get custody of my boys. He stated there was no custody agreement which there was it was 50/50. He had a me take a court ordered drug test for controlled substances, I passed for the controlled substance which is narcotic drugs from what I was told, however there was the presence of other drugs in my system, i.e. marijuana. Now my ex husband will not let me see my kids when I have court ordered supervised visits which his new wife is NOT allowed to come to but has came to two after me being kept away from my kids for almost a year, is telling me I have to do a urine and hair follicle drug test is this true? Can I reject the hair follicle test?43675.8236111111 I recently got married. ###. It was not a planned marriage it was a spur of the moment thing. I have been with this man for ###. We have ###. On ###th, ### ###. It devastated me. I have not been emotionally or mentally stable since. I'm not sure if it was the distress of losing the baby or my hormones but i got married without thinking it through. I feel it was the biggest mistake ever and that I wasnt thinking clearly when I done it. I was wondering what the laws are on annulment and if my situation would qualify for one. 43676.6618055556 North Carolina allows annulment only in very limited circumstances:  a marriage between close family members; where one party is under 16; where one party is already married; or where one party is physically impotent.  None of those seem to apply to you.43704.7166666667 A week ago, I visited Interact domestic advocating for advice about dealing with my ex-husbands (non physically violent) anger issues and drinking issues toward our children and myself - we live together. Divorced ###, resumed a relationship once a year ago. After speaking with myself and children; CPS was involved. There is no investigation on me and I have been deemed no danger to my children.  As part of their safety plan, I was told to file for an ex-parte prior to CPS speaking with my ex husband.  ### the ex party was granted even though the judge agreed that it was not necessary and would most likely be dismissed.  However, out of fear of possibly being seen as â€œnon compliantâ€ by CPS, I filed for the ex parte.  I have not met the assigned CPS worker but made contact to speak to her regarding the judge stating this is a family issue and not one that should be involving a protection order.  I mentioned to the social worker that I would much prefer my ex husband to attend parenting classes, anger management etc.  She did not have time to talk and hasnâ€™t looked into the case yet but will be visiting our home with the children and I tomorrow. My question: if I move to withdraw the ex parte, can CPS legally take my children from me even though I have been deemed a fit mother and of no threat because of non compliance? I have been very compliant. However financially I can not afford to return to court since I am not ### employed.  Also, the judge stated that there would be no reason to grant an order.  The CPS worker told me to go to court anyway but I do not agree there is a need to pursue this since there is no fear or danger of my ex husband physically hurting any of us.43676.7256944444 At the time of signing he only had ###. How do bypass probate?43677.6375 The important question is what were his assets and how were they titled. You must consider each item and figure out how it is to go where he wanted it to go.  If there is a joint owner on his bank account, for instance, that money will go to the joint owner.  Many assets have beneficiaries or joint owners that get those things regardless of the will.  Once you have examined the assets, you will know what must go to probate and what avoids it.Then, assuming there are assets that need to go to probate, you must consider the will.  Two witnesses are a minimum requirement of a typed will. If there is a notary and a witness, the notary can be considered a witness, and the will is not self-proving. Another possible solution might be that the will was written entirely in the handwriting of the testator.  If it was handwritten by the person making the will, it is considered a Holographic will" and witnesses are not required in advance (when the will is executed).  You will need to have two people attest the the clerk about where the will was found the handwriting and so forth in order to have this kind of will admitted to probate.So you can see I need a lot more information to begin to guess what will happen with your father's assets."43677.7986111111 I recently was awarded a DVPO on my husband. it was awarded to myself and both my ###. I was given the house and custody for the year. The house was mine prior to marriage but i didn't know about pre- marital assets and the house was refinanced in his name in 2009. so i am on the deed but not the loan. i have been paying the loan by myself for the last couple of months and will for the next year. he doesn't want the house and i do. my credit is not the best and i am working on it and his isn't either. my question is: should i hold off on filing for equitable distribution and custody etc. since it will ### the domestic violence order. i can't buy him out of the house yet and i also have temporary custody until ###th ###. I am hearing mixed feelings from my friends and i'm torn. I do not think he has an attorney so i'm not worried that he will file.also can the house still be considered mine? this was my mothers house and she bought it ###. I purchased the home from her husband right before she died and half the price as my inheritance. is it possible that it can still be considered mine even though we refinanced in ###. it was only because he made more money at the time because i owned my own business. we were trying to lower our payments.Does the protection order help me at all in the divorce for distribution, child custody, support, visitation?43679.6284722222 Background:Through doctor's appointments, discussion with a family advocate, and sessions with a therapist, my husband and I plan to file for custody of his other two biological children - 8yo boy and ### girl - due to the severe lack of attention of their medical needs, and the children's mother's lack of cooperation in effective co-parenting which creates parent alienation between the children and their father.

He moved out ###. He has been adamant about finalizing a divorce. Heâ€™s offered me a cash amount of $50,### $350,### ###. His annual income is approximately $###. My income is approximately $###.

No legal papers have been filed for a separation or divorce. 43685.1638888889 Thanks!43705.9076388889 There are actually two areas of family law raised by your question:  equitable distribution and alimony.A claim for equitable distribution has nothing to do with when a divorce is ### that such a claim must be filed in court, or resolved through a separation agreement, prior to the entry of a divorce judgment.  There is a presumption in the law that each spouse is entitled to half of all marital assets and debts, which is defined as those that came into existence during the marriage other than inheritances or gifts.  It doesn't matter who earned the most during the marriage.  All property that came into the marriage is part of the marital estate, including contributions to one spouse's 401(k) account.Alimony is based on the income of spouses, not their assets.  For alimony to be available, one spouse must be considered dependent" on the other spouse's income meaning that they do not have sufficient income to support themselves.  But it also must be true that the other spouse is a "supporting spouse which means that their own income exceeds their own personal expenses.  Alimony is the type of claim that is very difficult to advance without the assistance of an attorney.I hope this helps.  Good luck! 43704.7090277778 Two days ago, I came home from work and my fiance, along with my ###. I believe they left the state and are at her parents house in New ###.

I am financially strapped due to supporting my entire family. I am desperate for my children and I sake. 43685.5861111111 Thank you for contacting NC Free Legal Answers. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer to your question. Under NC law, you would not be able to put your husband out of the home just based on the information you have provided. If you are comfortable providing some additional facts, I might be able to provide more information that could help you reach a decision about how to proceed.Do you rent or own your property? Whose name is on the lease or mortgage? You mentioned that your husband refuses to leave, have you discussed this already? Have you tried to reach an agreement about who should remain in the home? Are you willing and able to leave? Are you also seeking a divorce? Do you have concerns for your safety or the safety of your children? Is abuse or violence an issue? You mentioned that your husband is an addict, is he seeking treatment? Do feel that he is dangerous to himself or others?I realize that I have asked a lot of questions, but I want to understand your situation better in order to offer you the most appropriate advice.Thank you.43725.0951388889 Thank you for providing this additional information. I asked about violence and abuse because in those cases, the victim could pursue a domestic violence protective order. The court could provide immediate and temporary possession of the marital home under this type of order. However, you have indicated domestic violence is not an issue, so this course of action would not be appropriate.You are correct. You must be separated for a year before filing for divorce. You must also be living in separate homes and at least one of you must intend for the separation to be permanent. The best option would be for you and your husband to come to an agreement and he find another place to live. However, it sounds like you have discussed this and you have not been able to come to a resolution yet.I would like to suggest that you consider a Divorce from Bed and Board. This is not actually a divorce, instead it is a court ordered separation. You and your husband would no longer live together, but you still maintain the marital bond. In order to obtain a Divorce for Bed and Board, you would have to prove fault on the part of your husband. In your case you could make the argument that your husbandâ€™s drug abuse makes your condition intolerable and life burdensome. Other grounds might include abandonment, malicious turning out of doors, cruel or barbarous treatment, indignities, or adultery. You would also have to show that you did not contribute to his misconduct. If the court grants the Divorce from Bed and Board, your husband would leave the home and you would have a formal date of separation when you pursue a divorce in the future.This link is to additional resources from Legal Aid of NC, including the documents you will need to file if you decide to purse the Divorce from Bed and Board.###I hope you find this information helpful.Thank you.43726.0673611111 Thank you for your response!I do own my home. I worked hard to buy it in ###. It is only in my name, although, I did purchase it while we were married. He would never try to take the home from me as he knows that I pay every single ### so I do not think that would be an issue. He does refuse to leave. He says he refuses to be homeless and he does not have a job so therefore no way to pay rent. We have discussed this numerous times. I am unable to leave my home. As I stated, my name is on the mortgage and all of the bills attached to the home. I work and pay for everything so there is no way that I could afford to leave as I have obligations to pay all current bills. I am seeking a separation. I know in NC you have to be separated for at least a year before you can file for divorce. Depending on if he decides to seek long ###, inpatient treatment in that time would be the de###ining factor on if I proceeded with a divorce.I do not have concerns for my safety as far as him physically hurting me. Physical abuse and violence is not an issue. I do, however, have concerns on who he brings into my home when I am not there and sometimes when my children and I are asleep. Multiple people are in and out of my house when I am not home and they all have drug records. My husband has been on probation for about two months and has failed one drug test, that I know of, which caused him to do a ### in county jail for two days. He is being forced to go to state funded OUTPATIENT rehab which he has attempted on numerous times and has never ###. He does not have the desire to stop using and has made this clear. His drug use has caused me severe ###. 43725.5152777778 Hi, I apologize for the delayed response.  Thank you, again, for sharing your time & information.  I am sorry if I have confused the issue. The probate attorney knows about the offer & wrote the more official sounding settlement agreement I uploaded here.  I voiced my concerns initially via phone but was told they represent the estate & ### (executor) is basically the estate" & quickly ended the call.  They did tell me they told him to get another attorney to make the offer to us because that was not something they could do on behalf of the estate.  Via email the attorney has seemed aware & has mentioned getting my own attorney & suggested a special needs trust.  I do not know if he knows the content of specific messages ### has sent to me & the others.  The entire chain of events being sure to include all parts where I had contact with the probate attorney:###### probate attorney assistant notified us we would get a check in ### no info about how or why only that we were beneficiaries.###### heard nothing called & assistant said they were waiting on executor to prepare house to sell. I asked if if I needed to do anything & they said just to sit & wait & joked it was the easiest way I will ever get a check.  She said to wait for a check in ###. A few weeks later the executor posted on my facebook wall asking for my address.  I explained I am homeless & would be unable to afford my paid mailbox beyond the end of that month so I provided ###. He responded the next day that he mailed it to my sister. My sister texted me photos of the ### letter explaining he doesnt think the will is fair & wants us to give up rights for payment. It was so difficult for me to read that I became physically ill anticipating the next sentence would be something awful about my dead parents.  I immediately called probate attorney who made ### comments about ### being the executor & the executor being the estate & got me off the phone in less than ###.I did not want to sign the attached offer letter.  I felt the letter was ### & poorly structured.  I had wanted to file bankruptcy & I was told last fall probate would interfere with that so my initial concern was not even for medicaid.  I felt the deal wasnt in my best interests.  I found out my cousins were told they would lose their inheritance if I didnt sign & that resulted in intense messages pressuring me.  The only words from executor to me had been "no rush." The next I heard from executor was that he would need to reduce his offer if I didnt sign quickly.  He said I had delayed probate so much that there would be extra fees. I attempted getting help from legal aid here but they would not even talk to me since it is NC probate.  I tried legal aid there but they do not handle probate.  I contacted private attorneys but could not even afford a consultation.  The only legal advisement I received concerned medicaid.  I was concerned bc his letter said he would pay "on or before ######."  I was told I had to receive payment for anything I signed & spend within ###.I contacted executor with info & agreed to sign the offer only because the executor said he would "expedite payment."  I naively thought he was recognizing my need & responding.  When the lawyer created version of the offer arrived it had a firm ### date & the executor said it was my fault my sister's fault & due to him not being able to access funds without penalty. The probate attorney said there was no legal reason for the date & that it was ###'s choice.I again stated I couldnt sign without losing medicaid because I was told signing it makes it my asset even if I would be unable to spend it down until ###. So on paper I would have $10###.  I worried myself sick trying to figure it out.  I was afraid my cousins and sibling would lose their money.  I even tried to sell it to those estate buying people but it was too small.  I landed on finding a way to just give it to my sister by having her buy me out or just relinquishing it to her since I owe her some money & I updated all of this with the executor.He apparently told the probate attorney who emailed me about special needs trusts.  I found out that also required fees and a lawyer.  The stress pushed me into a physical medical crisis & brief hospitalization with symptoms of vision loss for ###.  I resumed trying to figure out a special needs trust & still intended to find a way to sign when the executor sent this last ### of messages.  These pushed me into another physical health crisis where my blood pressure reached ### crisis levels.  So that is where I am today.  I have not spoken to the probate attorney in weeks.  I do not know whether to tell him about ###'s recent messages.  If he is fully on ###'s side sharing the info cant help me.  Even if he isnt I dont know that sharing the info helps me. I spent some time ### gathering info from the Clerk of Court about petitioning to remove ### as executor.  That is not likely to be an option for me as the Clerk of Court shared it is not only costly but I would really need someone to be in person for the hearing.  My cousins are unlikely to agree to ### action as they are the ones mentioned in the letter as taking ### while my grandfather was alive.  One has court costs to cover & one has bad blood with the executor.  They have likely signed as they stated previously to my sister & myself thst they dont want to deal with him in any way. My sister does not want to spend one second on this man or his drama.  She had not signed as of last weekend.  There was an error and she requested new forms but they did not yet send out replacements.I apologize as this is super long but that is everything as best I understand it.  The personal health stuff seems irrelevant but I think it helps explain why I am so scared to lose medicaid.  Also why his threat to put my medicaid at risk was so powerful over me. He is a career healthcare administrator who is well versed in the legalities of medicaid.  I dont believe that I broke any rules but I do think he has knowledge of the ### that could stop my benefits until the claims are found to be unsubstantiated.I am in a very vulnerable situation. I ended up here by moving to CA becoming physically ill & suddenly dependent on a person on the autism spectrum for my needs. From a half million dollar townhouse in ### to a ### in ### parking lot in less ### ###; possibly record time.  Add in the fact that I have lost both parents grandparents aunts uncles lifetime best friend ### ### all belongings as well as physical structures of childhood & adult homes all in the last ### ###.  The call about the inheritance last september came after a long physical health hospitalization & it gave me hope to keep trying to dig out.  I didnt know an amount for the check but I knew $### & an ### to put distance between me & my abuser $### hotel bed & shower & a flight to a dv shelter in another state that takes pets $### ### & time to focus fully on medical treatment physical therapy & paying the licensure fees to return to my previous job in healthcare. This estate ### a path home for me & my cats.  So I used every safety net I had secured to survive those ###. Now my resources are ### exhausted & I have been running on fumes since that time. ###nie knows the specifics of my situation as I ### detailed to him while apologizing for missing funerals & begging him for personal belongings of my mom that were in the house.  I found out just Sunday that he gave my dead mom's dead mom's (### first wife) photo albums to my great aunt.  That is fine for now because i never met my grandma since she died when Mom was ### & opens more ###.  That was my mother's & he knew it was wanted & now it is gone.  He also knows my sister and I were financially responsible for our disabled parents and it wiped us out. In the end I do not know how I can choose his offer over my healthcare.  If I did I would not likely survive until the payment date.  Every day is super hard & I dont know if he assumes that because I am homeless that I am on drugs or have otherwise altered judgment but there has never been one second I felt like this deal was in my best interest.  I just didnt want my relatives to suffer because of me.  ### I also didnt want people to think I was greedy & after money.  I adored my ###.  My mama did too.  I would never want to dishonor him in any way & I was happy the house would stay in the family.  However it is now clear to me that ### does not consider me family.  He actually almost implies as much in a few messages.Sorry for the exceeded word limit & personal garbage dumping but I wanted to clear any confusion I left with my other messages.  I think the probate attorney knows & is cool with it moving forward in this way.  The whole story is the only way I could make sense of it & so I shared it in that way.  Also sorry for delay.  When my partner is symptomatic life becomes extra difficult.  I have spent the last ### no gas no food no medicine as he refuses to do even let me access a bathroom until I earn money to support us while simultaneously ### denying me access to the things I need to earn money.  Free starbucks water is legit the only comfort in my general vicinity & this executor wants to accuse me of trying to take something from his life.  There are not enough words in my vocabulary to articulate all of the ways this executor is complicating my already difficult existence.  I am so close to being out from under this entire mess & I feel like this man is just kicking rocks on the pile at a rapid pace.If I didnt use up all of your free time with this ### of sad shame I will email you the original documents as attached to the messages on this site.  I really do appreciate your opinion time & support.  I feel validated.  However I also worry I am in over my head understand absolutely none of this & am over reacting & blowing a good thing for everyone.  Thank you again for your time.  I will upload the documents tonight unless the phone gets disconnected.  In that case I will send the first time I am able to access wifi.  Have a good week ahead!* ### will be address with documents attached"43690.9965277778 Hi, I hope your Monday is going well. I wanted to offer possibly a final update on my situation.  The contact with the probate attorney did not ### any new information.  He says I am not allowed that information under NC law unless the executor wants to share it (messages attached).  I would be lying if I said I had a plan.  I barely even know what words to out in this message.  I think I have already used them all trying to get this sorted.  If i figure something out, I promise to send a happy message your way with a positive update.  Regardless, I sincerely appreciate your help with better understanding my situation. Have a great week ahead!43696.7569444444 I read your note and tried to decipher the ### of the correspondence you attached.  I understand that you have inherited a share of your grandparents' estate and your uncle does not think it is fair.  It appears that he has the power to sell the real property.  (We would need to look at the will to confirm that).  He wants to sell it to himself, apparently at a great bargain.  Most of this correspondence is self-serving justification.  There is no accounting to justify the transaction he is proposing.  He needs an appraisal of the property and documentation of the expenditures he claims he made to justify a price.  Delaying payment for a year would need proper documentation and would not be in your best interests if you are on Medicaid.  So, now he is trying to scare you into taking what he offers.The Court may accept a sale by him as Executor, but if he is going to sell it to himself, without paying the other heirs, I seriously doubt it.  So, I do not think you should accept this without getting a clear businesslike proposal from the attorney for the estate.  If he is threatening to report you to the Medicaid officials, it is clear that he is not being honest or honorable.  Tell him you need an offer through the attorney that involves a cash transaction, not one that has your financing his purchase.  If he cannot do that, tell him to sell the entire property to a third party.  If he refuses that, call the Clerk and ask for help having him removed as Executor.  This is hard for you being all the way across the country.  Are any of the other heirs closer?  Do you have contact with them?  Will they take your side on this?43685.7645833333 Notified of beneficiary status for my grandfather's estate (only due to the death of my mother) last September & told to expect check in ###.  At ###, probate attorney says they are still waiting on executor & mention he has made no progress on preparing the property to sell & to wait another ###. A few weeks later, executor sends multi page letter explaining he wants to keep the property, how he spent the last several months hunting another will, all the reasons this will is unfair, why he thinks I don't deserve inheritance as well as other upsetting content.  I was actually ### reading it afraid he was going to say something awful about my dead parents in the next sentence.  The letter also said he wants me to sign form giving away all rights to estate for either $10k or nothing.  It was very upsetting and he didnt even name us as grandchildren or family in the letter.  He only mailed the letter to NC, i am in CA, and He told me to take my time.  Yet, within a few weeks, he tells me he will reduce my payment is I don't sign quickly. I was concerned that he doesn't want to pay until ### & but after he says he will expedite payment,  I signed his informal form.  The probate attorney prepares a formal document but it has the ###.  The executor says it is due to my delays.  I explain - as I did before - that signing this will cause me to lose Medicaid because it will be treated as an asset even though I can't spend it down until ###.  I work on solutions to signing at the suggestion of probate attorney. Then, last night, executor sends me a message telling me that he's going to report me for Medicaid fraud because I've left him with no other option. He says I have to renounce inheritance or accept his offer or it will force a sale of the property.  He demanded a response and, so I said to sell the house. This morning, he responded with a message saying that isn't an option for me.  He says I wont force the sale that I have to accept or renounce.  When this began, I tried accessing legal aid in California but they said since NC probate, they can't help out.  I tried nc legal aid who doesn't do probate litigation.  I called attorneys and couldn't even afford the triple digit consultations.  I am completely at a loss as how to respond.  What do I do next? Is there a way to just go back to waiting on a check?  The executor is scaring me & I am very confused & overwhelmed.  Absolutely any guidance beyond talk to a lawyer" is appreciated.   This may be my only chance to officially speak directly to an attorney.  Attached are ### recent messages offer letter & official agreement.  Thank you for your time.  Have a good week ahead."43685.6791666667 Thank you for your time and response.  I was going to wait until morning to reply to you when I was a bit more rested but he just messaged me again & it has me pretty upset.  I will attach it.  I have not responded to him since answering the first message with sell the house" I do not plan to reply to the new message.  As silly as it sounds I'm having serious blood pressure ### every time he messages me.  Any phone noise triggers anxiety.To answer your questions the other heirs are all in NC.  However the ###.  They wanted to sign quickly - despite the original offer having the same ### date - because one needed the money for court.  I think the other one mentioned received money from my grandfather before he died & just didnt want to fight.My sibling does not want to fight it because she does not care to waste the time & energy.  She has not yet signed either but will likely do so as she isnt interested in the responsibility of litigation.  She is the most financially secure of the heirs & just wants this to be over with as little interference to her life aa possible.  It is my understanding all other heirs agree that ### is only looking out for his interests but no one can fight it Just to clarify do I message the executor directly to ask for the things you mentioned?  Do I tell the probate attorney anything about this situation?  In the past the assistant made the comment that e couldnt refer me to an attorney because they represent the estate & the estate is this executor.  So I am not sure if I should tell them anything happening at the moment.  I dont want to bother them with it or cause any problems.I will attempt to visit california legal aid decedent clinic next week during their next meeting.  I was turned away last time I tried so i am not too hopeful of a positive outcome.  In the meantime I will take all of your suggestions & figure out what to say to who to get things moving in a different direction.  This is so confusing & with my health issues my brain is honestly needing a break from all of it in a big way.I want to thank you sincerely for being so thoughtful in your response.  There have not been many times in life where I threw my hands in the air not knowing how to proceed but this was definitely an area I was not able to navigate on my own.  You validated all of the feelings i have been having since this began earlier this year.  I didnt speak up since I didnt want people to think i was after money but the threats are too scary to stay quiet.I###ically I was happy he wanted to keep the house.  I actually lived in it with my grandparents ### my first years of life.  My most recent dog is even buried there.  However the executor of this estate has made my grief situation tremendously more difficult.  I am ready to put this behind me in the least damaging way possible.  Any further advisement you have to offer is appreciated.  At this point money is secondary to sanity.Have a good weekend ahead. Thanks again.Edit: Also after rereading your message to make sure I didnt miss anything attaching the will that was included with the offer"43686.4875 This page in the will directs that the real estate be sold.  The Executor does not have the discretion to disregard the will.  You could telephone or e-mail the probate attorney to clarify.  Tell them that you understand the Will directs the Executor to sell the house and you want to confirm that this is what will happen, since you think you understand the Executor to be telling you he plans to ignore the Will.  I am very interested to see what the attorney supervising the estate thinks.  I bet he is not aware that all this is going on.This man is clearly trying to intimidate you into doing what he wants.  That likely means he knows he does not have the right to disregard the will -- maybe I am reading to much into this.  But, it seems to me that the less you react and the less you let him think he can bully you, the more likely he is to have to do what the will instructed.  Could you e-mail these documents to me directly so that I could see them better?  My e-mail address is ###. 43689.8270833333 the Inventory in the Estate is a matter of public record and it would be courteous for the attorney to e-mail it to you.  But, it is not terribly relevant to the question at hand: What is the value of the house.  I think if you sit quiet for a while things will get a little clearer.  If you get closer to ###20, you are safer to sign an agreement to sell it on that date without adverse consequences.Stay calm so your health is not threatened.  This is not worth that. Send me a note on my e-mail.  They will close this soon.43696.8479166667 Hi ###,I can understand why you and your husband (Dad") are concerned about his children living in a home with his ex-wife's ("Mom") new husband  the felon.First is there a court order in place that awarded your husband ("Dad") and his ex-Wife ("Mom") Joint legal custody and shared physical custody of the children?   If yes then if  Dad wants to have the custodial arrangement changed he will need to file a Motion to Modify Custody with the Court.  In NC for a Court to have the authority to modify an existing custody order the Court must follow a two part process (###) Dad must prove to the court that since the entry of the existing custody order there has been a substantial change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the children;  if Dad can meet this hurdle then (###) Dad must introduce evidence to the court that shows it is in the best interest of the children to modify the prior custody order so that Dad is given sole legal custody and  primary physical custody  of the children with Mom receiving some sort of specified visitation that will restrict or prohibit Mom's new husband form having contact with the kids. If there is not a court order in place  then instead of filing a Motion to Modify Dad will need to file  new lawsuit in which he will ask the Court to establish custody and visitation of the children.  In this instance Dad should be prepared to introduce evidence of the new husband's history criminal convictions  and how that connects to the welfare of his children.  Also Dad must introduce evidence to the court that shows it is in the best interest of the children to enter an initial custody order that awards Dad sole legal custody and primary physical custody  of the children with Mom receiving some sort of specified visitation that will restrict or prohibit Mom's new husband from having contact with the kids.Unless there s some proof that the new husband has endangered Dad's children this may be a difficult case in which to prevail.  therefore I recommend that your husband not try to do this on his own.  Instead he should consult with a ### County Attorney who has experience in handling custody cases.  It will be worth the cost of a consultation fee for your husband to sit down with the attorney and discuss his situation with the lawyer.I hope the children stay safe and that the situation resolved in a manner you and your husband like."43686.6423611111 My husband's ex-wife married a man who is a felon convicted of (609.345.1(d) | Criminal Sex ### ### Mental ###).

We were living together for a couple years after my daughter was born, but it became difficult for her taking care of my daughter in her condition while I was working full time. So, she moved in with her parents who are retired for help. We had plans for us to all be under one roof once again but obviously never can be fulfilled now. My daughter was living with her mom in their household and ### passed away living there.

For separation, you do not need to file anything unless you are seeking what is called a Divorce from Bed and Board which is a judicial decree of separation by the court, and which, under N.C.### Â§ ###, can be granted for any of the following reasons (see statute below):Â§ ###. Grounds for divorce from bed and board. The court may grant divorces from bed and board on application of the party injured, made as by law provided, in the following cases if either party: (###) Abandons his or her family. (###) Maliciously turns the other out of doors. (###) By cruel or barbarous treatment endangers the life of the other. In addition, the court may grant the victim of such treatment the remedies available under ### 50B-###, et seq. (###) Offers such indignities to the person of the other as to render his or her condition intolerable and life burdensome. (5) Becomes an excessive user of alcohol or drugs so as to render the condition of the other spouse intolerable and the life of that spouse burdensome. (6) Commits adultery.Otherwise, if divorce from bed and board does not apply, you would start separation by simply moving apart and ceasing any regular sexual relations (sporadic marital relations can occur without the one-year separation period being broken, as long as the spouses do not begin living together again).  After one year, either spouse can sue for divorce in North Carolina as long as at least one spouse has lived in the state continuously for at least six months.  It would be far more beneficial for your spouse to agree to a negotiated separation agreement (drafted by legal counsel and reviewed by lawyers on both sides), because it gives you and your spouse more control over the terms of the divorce, than you will have if the sides cannot agree on anything, and then the judge has to call all the shots.  I would stress this to your spouse, and if there is an agreement to negotiate separation and divorce terms, you both should have your own family law attorneys to walk you though this, step by step.If after a year of separation has passed and you are in a position where you have to file for divorce without legal counsel, I would first ask the courthouse whether there are any self-help forms for ### ### distribution there, that might be of help to you.  Also consider calling the ### Family Law Clinic in ###, and asking them for any packets they have (for which they usually charge a very small fee).  See this link:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/file-it-yourself/Please note that you can also contact the family law clinic at Wake Forest University School of Law in ###, and ask for any free or low-cost resources they can make available to you regardin###paration, divorce, child custody and equitable distribution.Blessings to you and your family as you work through this process.  May better things and ### await you on the other end.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43719.9201388889 How do I get a custody agreement with little money?43689.7909722222 Hello, Ms. ###:Thanks for your question.  I am not sure what you are referring to in terms of the case or process" (although I assume it is some type of family law matter) but I do know that many lawyers will work with you on a payment plan if you can deposit with the###certain sum of money (usually a few thousand dollars) upfront which shows them that in the long run they can count on you to finance the litigation in predictable installments.  The only way to know if this is feasible for both you and the lawyer is to call or email around and ask.

We have ### , 14, 17, ### (or myself because he wants the divorce. He wants us to sell the house, split the profits and go our separate ways, I do not want to uproot my children because he wants to leave. I have told him that He can have everything IN  the house, I wouldn't even ask for alimony, just support for the children -- if he wants a divorce- just leave- but he refuses to. I just want my house to raise the children as uninterrupted as possible. Since then, he's been mentally abusive, accusing me of stealing his mail (?), monitoring my social media and forcing me to make my social media private" so people won't have access to me walking up to me very close and verbally threatening me not communicating when there are things with the children. He has been physically abusive in the past and now I'm beginning to be a little more "cautious" since this new development with his paranoia and threats. My question is: What is the likelihood of my having to leave my home with the children (and sell it like he wants) if HE is the one wanting the divorce?

This child in the last ###.  She has always be sent off to other people to be raised.  She has never known love by a mother or father. I am her 3rd cousin. we took a Domestic Violence order out on her, but it's only until Oct.  She does not want to go home because of being fearful. She has stated she will kill herself if she has to go home.  I am just trying to help the child.   I need some help. Either Custody or emancipation whatever I need to do is what I will do for this child.  Her father has never been in her life so he is out of the equation.  Although they both were in Child Support Court last week and both are supposed to start paying for her.  It's not about the money at all, it is the principal that her mother hasn't even tried to send money for the child's needs.  The child has anxiety attacks and panic attacks because of the treatment she has along with some PTSD.  When she first moved in she was having night terrors of her mother and over the last ###, they have subsided the thought of having to go back to that ### hole makes her have them again.  Her mother has repeatedly threatened her.  Her step-sister and her full sister are both ready to testify how ### has been treated throughout the child's life.The picture I attached is ###'s mother.  She is a meth head and alcoholic. 43692.775 Hello. Thank you for your question. I am sorry to hear about this difficult situation. If a restraining order is obtained on behalf of a child against his or her parent, Child Protective Services often becomes involved in order to legally remove the child from the home and place the child with safe, appropriate care. If Child Protective Services has not yet become involved with this child's life, I recommend filing a report with that agency, which can help the child secure safe, legal guardianship if her mother is not an appropriate care taker. I also recommend informing the court of your desire to take legal guardianship of the child when the Domestic Violence Restraining Order is up for reconsideration in October. The judge may be able to help settle custody as well as enforce child support. You also should ask the court to appoint a Guardian ad Litem in order to represent the interests of the child in the custody matter -- this person, who is often but not always a lawyer, will make sure that the child's voice and needs are heard in the court. If you are interested in hiring an attorney in order to pursue legal guardianship of the child, I recommend using the Lawyer Referral Service to get a name of a family law attorney who may be able to assist. This is not free representation, but the attorney will provide an initial, 30-minute consultation and charge no more than $50. After that, regular attorney fees will apply. 43704.6854166667 Hello. Thank you for your question. The division of your assets (income, taxes, property, etc.) during your separation will be determined by your separation agreement with your husband. If you have not yet drafted, signed and filed a separation agreement you should do so as soon as possible. You may wish to hire an attorney to help you with that process. If you need a referral to an attorney, you can contact the Lawyer Referral Service and ask for a referral to a family law attorney. The number to reach the Lawyer Referral Service is ###-###. The lawyer referral service is not a free legal service, but they will provide you the name of an attorney who will do an initial ### $###. You also may wish to register for one of Legal Aid of ### self-help legal clinics to learn more about the process of filing for child custody or divorce.

We have three children43692.7590277778 Hello, Ms. Boone:Thank you for this important question.  I assume for purposes of this brief explanation that you are proceeding in this lawsuit on your own, without a lawyer.  Here are some helpful things for you to know as you prepare your response.First, know that as long as you are within your initial 30-day window in state court, you can file a Motion for Extension of Time with the Clerk of Superior Court, which will afford you an extra ###-answer motion under Rule 12, an Answer, or both in the same ###.  As long as you are still within your first ###, your extension will be automatic upon filing a proper motion.  You would have to file one version with the Court, then mail a ### copy to the plaintiff, along with a Certificate of Service pursuant to Rule ### (you can either use first-class mail to serve, or hand deliver a copy to the plaintiff.  Your Certificate of Service should indicate what method of service under Rule ###.  Note that all Certificates of Service should be left with both the Clerk and the opposing party.Now as to the substance of your Answer.  You should borrow the format of the Complaint, using the same heading area at the top of page 1, and the same enumerated paragraph format that you see in the Complaint.  You MUST address each and every paragraph in the Complaint, and cannot simply say that you admit or deny all content in the initial pleading.  For example, if you wish to deny all statements contained in Plaintiff's paragraph ###, you would create a paragraph ###, Denied."  If there are paragraph allegations that are completely accurate (an easy example would be in the beginning paragraphs which usually contain paragraphs setting out the identities of the parties and where they reside) you would say "Admitted."  If there are paragraphs that contain partially correct information and partially incorrect information in the same corresponding paragraph you should indicate which parts of the paragraph you are admitting and which ones you are denying.  If you are vague and incomplete in your responses the plaintiff can make a Motion to Strike under Rule 12(f) or a Motion for More Definite Statement under Rule 12(e) compelling you to more directly answer the plaintiff's query.  So being CONcise and PREcise is important when drafting your replies.As you prepare your responses look carefully at Rule 8(c) to determine whether you have any affirmative defenses available to you.  You need to plead these in your Answer or else you run the risk of waiving them for the remainder of the lawsuit.  I am not warranting that any such defenses apply but if they do you need to raise them while you still can.  These would be in a separate section after you have answered each of the plaintiff's paragraph allegations in the Complaint.Also look at Rule 12(b) to see if any of the procedural grounds for dismissal exist.  If so you can either (1) incorporate the Rule 12(b) objections into your Answer as part of one integrated ### to Dismiss and ### (2) you could simply raise the 12(b) objections first as a free-standing document and see if the judge will dismiss the lawsuit.  If so you win; if not you have another ### ### separate and apart from your Rule 12(b) objections.If you have counterclaims you would like to raise against the plaintiff that are well supported by fact and law you can raise the counterclaims in your Answer.  You would need to list the facts justifying the counterclaims just like the Complaint.  Essentially you would be ### the plaintiff and this would require a payment of $200.###'s internal system.Lastly when you get to the Prayer for Relief section of the Complaint you should specifically ask that the Court deny whatever forms of relief the plaintiff "prayed" for in the section if you believe the plaintiff has no grounds to be awarded such relief.  You do not have to go into detail as to why you believe that but you should specifically ask that the court deny the requested relief if that is your objection as the defendant.A helpful tip would be to either visit a library well stocked with North Carolina legal ### and look at ### form book and/or other manuals on civil litigation practice in North Carolina or find the name of a lawsuit with which you are familiar and look at sample Answers from real lawsuits previously filed.  Otherwise hew closely to the format of the Complaint even if your responsive ### Motion to Dismiss Answer Counterclaim or a combination of all ### differs as to substance and import.Hope this gives you a helpful overview.  I have included a link to the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure: ###Read them carefully and over and over again.  Also visit a public library or law library and look at the most current version of the NC General Statutes if you want access to footnotes to NC cases that have interpreted how the rules should be applied in specific instances.Blessings and best wishes to you going forward.Brandon A.

He is re-married & he put his new wife as the parent. I called their secretary, she had no idea how it got like that or who changed it, and after I told her I was going to go above her, she finally told me my son's Dad requested separate accounts. It was fixed & I was put back on as the mother but she then told me I had to discuss who changed my name with him. I then went & spoke with the principle about it & he could have really cared less it happened. Was not very compassionate & told me that our son's Dad is the one who changed it because you are able to edit parent info. This morning, I went in & gave the principle a copy of my son's birth certificate & a copy of our divorce papers showing proof I am the mother & it was put in my son's his file. This is a private school, by the way, my ex-husband pays & all the parents & teachers really are not too friendly with me. After the email I wrote my son's teacher, her demeanor & personality towards me was not as ### & welcoming when I introduced myself to her on the first day. I feel my ex & new wife are telling these teachers to just deal with him & her. Now, I did have a lawyer a few months back trying to help me get my child support modified & also was trying to help me with my rights as a mother because the step-mother was overstepping her boundaries & my ex was dictating everything. I have documented every conversation & email. What are my rights & what can I do about this?43696.7951388889 Hi ###, I am sorry you are going through such a hard time right now. Hopefully I can provide you with some direction. First, you need to find out which county the custody order is filed in, assuming it is in North Carolina. If it is not, you would need to go to an attorney in the state where the order was filed to assist you. In North Carolina, you are correct that you would file a Motion for Contempt to enforce a custody order. There are many things for the court to be made aware of, including whether and how many times you have requested to see your children. If a Custody Order exists the other party must follow unless there is some valid excuse. But, from your side you need to be clearly requesting that the other side comply with the court order and you must have the ability to exercise your custodial time in an appropriate environment. In regard to hiring an attorney, if you prevail with your Motion for Contempt, you have the ability to ask the court to order the other side to pay your attorney's fees. It doesn't guarantee that you get attorney's fees but you at least have the ability to hire a private attorney to pursue this issue for you. 43763.7694444444 I am at a complete loss. I can't afford an attorney and I have been bullied and controlled by the custodial parent for years. I just found out I had a way to fix this. I'd like to know how I can get an attorney on my income and what are some things that I can put into action Myself now to try to see the boys. They moved out of state and I'm not sure where they are.. I saw I could file contempt. What all do I need to file this and do I need evidence?43697.4055555556 Ms. ###:I hope your fall has commenced well.

It is a little hard to follow what you have written, but I will try to offer a few comments that might be relevant to your family's situation.  At some point in the near future (perhaps during September), I would strongly recommend that you consult with a local, ### County probate or real property lawyer (or both, since small towns often have lawyers expert in both areas), who can discuss this in a preliminary ### ### conversation.  It sounds like there are multiple owners in your family who have some fractional ownership share in the property, although it does not appear that all owners are equal in their ownership percentages.  If my assumption is correct, and not all owners are on the same page as to what to do with this property, the options would be either (###) for one relative to buy out the others' share in the property, or (###) file a partition action before the ### County Clerk of Superior Court, to either force a division of the property, or a judicial sale.  This is usually what happens in family situations like this unless the family can negotiate some other arrangement in writing.I am not sure if that ### exactly with what you are asking, but an initial consultation with a local probate or real property lawyer will render your options all the more clearer.  I would start there, then decide as a family how you wish to proceed.  At some point, a lawyer will have to be involved, so obtain good legal advice as soon as you reasonably can.Best wishes to you and your family this fall.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43704.0944444444 Hello, Mrs. ###:Thank you for posting this question.  This is a ### situation and I am very sorry that you find yourself here at this time.  As I read your question, at least two immediate possibilities came to my mind: first, would be Legal Aid of NC (### office), and the Family Law Clinic at my ### mater, ### School of Law in ###.  If either venue could at least provide you some consultation guidance, if not more, I do not believe you would have to pay anything for the advice.  That might be a way for you to at least get grounded in what your options and remedies are, as I do not necessarily believe that your husband would be without obligation to support you and the children if he elects to leave (possible, but just not likely if you are going to rear children who are under ###; there is no legal obligation to support children upon reaching ###).I would try contacting both and asking what they can provide you.  If they cannot help you manage the entire situation, they can either at least get you started, or refer you to other agencies or organizations that can assist you further.  The website link for Legal Aid of NC is http://www.legalaidnc.org/ , and the link for ### Family Law Clinic is http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/.

I want to complete the forms myself. 43700.7583333333 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for this very important question about such a sensitive matter.  I commend you for trying to do what is right for what I am sure is a special young woman.  I regret that you find yourself in such a difficult place.While you are waiting for your first hearing on the procedural and substantive merits of this case, I will offer a few general points, based on my ### knowledge of family law (which I admit I do not regularly practice).  Yes, ultimately, the biological mother can cut short your rights if the court sides with her, but there are some ### and exceptions that might play in your favor, depending on how the trial goes, the credibility of the witnesses under oath, and also the subjective attitude of the District Court judge who hears your case.  Judges are very conservative about taking away parental rights fro###biological parent, since the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled for over a generation that the ### of Rights to the U.S. Constitution guarantee a fundamental right to parenting and custody of minor ### ###" right that is rather than an explicitly mentioned one.  This does not ### that the biological parent will win no matter what but only that the law is heavily skewed in favor of the biological parent against a non-biological parent.  Basically a biological parent must be held to be ### unfit to raise a minor child.  This is a high standard and even less than honorable behavior as proven in court will not necessarily guarantee success for the non-biological parent no matter how honorable decent financially comfortable or well ###.  If the court finds however that the evidence shows that the parent is ### unfit the court does have the power to award custody to more fit persons.The court will take into account a variety of ### as the child's wishes (if the child is sufficiently mature enough to testify and appreciate the ### of making statements under oath as I suspect an ### old child would be) the moral environment of the child's surroundings and the presence of any illegal activity domestic violence abuse or anything potentially injurious to the ### the bottom line in any custody dispute is ### ### "best interests of the child."In analyzing this issue further the court will examine the so-called "### ### the North Carolina Supreme Court case of ### v. ### ###.C. ### (###) in which the Court interpreted the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ### that every biological parent has a constitutional right to care for and ### his/her own child.  Based on this presumption when there is a dispute between a parent and non-parent the parent wins unless the judge finds that the parent is unfit has neglected the child or has engaged in conduct inconsistent with the parental status (this is where factors such as abuse neglect and other bad-faith acts or omissions by the biological parent come into the analysis during the custody trial).Besides the obvious salutary differences between your environment for this child and the mother's you have two potential advantages working in your favor: first persons who have acted as parents to the child for lengthy periods of time have standing to at least sue for custody(Ellison v. ### ###.C. App. ### (###) and ### v. ### ###.C. App. ### (2008)); and second even if you fail to get custody based on the ### Presumption you still have standing under North Carolina law to seek visitation based on your status as a former stepparent (### v. ### ###.C. App. ### (###)).Note however that mere standing does not guarantee that the court will grant you what you are asking; it simply ###s that you have the legal right to seek it from the court in the first place.If necessary look up and read through these cases if you have to prepare for a custody trial without an experienced family law attorney.  You might also to find a copy of ### North Carolina Family Law and look closely at Chapter 13.  Read the ### text and footnotes to better understand how to craft a highly persuasive argument before the District Court judge.  (Look for these sources at a public library a resources library at your county government offices or at a law office in town.)I hope this is helpful to you in some way.  God bless you and all your family this fall.  I hope the recent hurricane was not too rough on your folks in ### County.Blessings### A. ### ### Esq."43732.1673611111 My ex girlfriend and I have ###.

In the absence of a lawyer, I suggest contacting the Catawba County Courthouse and asking one of the assistant clerks who staff the family law court there whether there are any self-help" packets for pro se litigants in child custody cases (in other counties there often is such a packet of materials for those who are filing for divorce on their own).  This could at least ground you in the procedural requirements of this case.  Also I would contact family law clinics at one or more of North ### six law schools and ask whether they can offer you any materials to help you file and pursue the case.   ### School of Law in ### has a family law clinic as does Wake Forest University School of Law.  See the following links:###: http://child-clinic.law.###.edu/###: http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/file-it-yourself/  (NOTE: pay special attention to the ### option as its packet was designed with you in mind)If neither school option nor the Catawba County Courthouse option works you can call ### University School of Law or Legal Aid of NC and ask for similar information about ### filing for child custody cases.

A legitimation action requests that the clerk legitimate the child as your child, and have your name added as the father on the birth certificate. It depends on the clerk whether an at home DNA test is sufficient without the mother's consent, but the clerk often requires a DNA test from a testing facility that can certify the results. A legitimation petition would be filed with the DNA test attached, and it would need to be served on the mother and the child, who would be assigned a guardian ad litem according to the rules of the county in which you file.43754.7458333333 Hello, Ms. ###:I would try the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association, and the Wake County Bar Association; they can probably provide you with some really good referrals in family law.

Given all the factors and moving parts in play here (as well as multiple owners), there really is no substitute for consulting in person with a local estate planning lawyer, who can talk through all the different strategies for ### for yourself and your children your goals for your part of the property.  A trust is a possible option, but it may not be the only one (or even the best one), depending on what you hope to do with this property, and also whether other family members with an interest in this property wish to sell or partition it.  There are simply so many questions that a lawyer would need to ask you, and discuss the answers to, before advising you for certain that a trust is appropriate.If a trust is appropriate, and all you wish to place inside it is the land (and perhaps a little money in a separate account in the name of the trust, to fund maintenance), you should ask your local lawyer in Northampton County (or thereabouts) to provide you with a fee quote for (###) a simple trust, and (###) a deed by which you convey your real property interests into a trust, and (###) any other services a lawyer may need to render in order to complete the entire transaction to your liking.  Note that the fee will vary based on the length of experience and degree of expertise of the lawyer involved, and also whether the trust would be the only major estate planning instrument, or whether it should be supplemented with a will, general power of attorney, healthcare power of ### directive.  Your lawyer can tell you ahead of time what all this will cost and what to budget for at each step of the way.What you are wish to do is certainly feasible for any competent estate planning lawyer; s/he simply needs to understand all the factors involved, and what, ultimately, are your goals in doing this.Regardless of what you and the other owners decide to do, I hope that all of you can work through these issues smoothly, for the benefit of your entire family.  May God bless all of you this fall.All the best,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43713.0090277778 I am sorry to hear this.  Everyone deserves peace of mind, and to be left alone when so desired.  I hope this nonsense soon ends for you all.  Blessings, good health and good things to come to all of you.43713.0715277778 Ms. ###:Thank you for posting with NC Free Legal Answers.  I am sorry your family has been through such a rough time of late; this is certainly not fun, to say the least.  It is hard to offer a definitive analysis of this situation since so much of the necessary context is missing (and that is no fault of your own, since even you do not know everything that is going on since you have no formal, legal authority over your stepfather's estate), but I can offer a few preliminary points.  Should you ultimately decide to challenge the executor's authority, I warn, you will eventually need to at least consult in person with a local probate lawyer, although I sincerely do understand that finances to pay for even a discussion with counsel is difficult at the present moment.  (If you ever can manage to do this, try reaching out to ### Page of ###, who is an excellent ### planning lawyer.)First, understand that an executor has broad and awesome authority over all property belonging to the estate, which can include the right to prevent certain persons from using or entering the property formerly owned by the deceased.  It is true, however, that real estate in North Carolina does not automatically become estate property in North Carolina (it can, if the will says so, but is not automatic), but becomes vested immediately upon the owner's death in the heirs/beneficiaries of the estate, unless or until selling the property becomes necessary in order to pay off final debts, claims, taxes, etc.  So if that is not necessary in order to close your stepfather's estate on good terms, it is entirely possible that the home itself will never officially become part of the actual estate (a lawyer would have to read the will in its entirety to confirm this, but so far, it sounds like you received correct information about this).You are also correct that distributions to ### is usually on equal terms according to the number of qualified ###, unless the will specifically says otherwise (as is sometimes the case, depending on the wishes of the testator).  Before being discharged from the fiduciary duties of the estate, the executor must submit, and have approved, a Final ### addition to the "Annual Accountings" already ### accounts for all distributions payments income and liabilities (if any outstanding) on the part of the estate.  So while the clerks at the courthouse will not necessarily be "confirming" how the executor cuts the final checks there is an accountability process designed to prevent executors and administrators from improperly distributing estate assets to themselves or others.  I simply do not have enough of a co###d of the facts of this situation to ascertain whether anything improper has been committed.  So far this sounds like a normal administration of an estate but I cannot say that for certain.The last thing I can addressed is the allegations of theft of your parents' personal belongings; if you have proof that theft occurred you can certainly report this to local law enforcement and see if they will open a criminal investigation; also at a later time you might be able to sue for the value or return of the items (within a three-year statute of limitations) most likely in small claims court unless the items in the aggregate are worth more than $###.  Beyond these efforts there is little you can do about this.This is about as much guidance as I can offer based on my incomplete understanding of the whole situation.  I admit that this response is imperfect and limited in scope but in truth a lawyer would really need to consult with you in person before offering you anything more definite in an ethical and responsible way.  I hope that ### Page or some other local lawyer of his caliber can meet with you and discuss should that ever be desired or necessary.  You can always call ###'s office and ask what a consultation fee would be (and also whether he occasionally offers free consultations which some lawyers do from time to time).God bless you and your family this fall.  I sincerely do hope and pray that your situation will markedly improve as soon as possible affording all of you some ### peace of mind.All the best### A. ### ### Esq."43712.9972222222 My real brother is the executor of my ### estate. He has used that position to try to control my family and how we live.  We are still homeless and trying to find a place for the entire family to live. We are temporarily staying with a friend and the kids are bouncing around friends houses that have understanding parents.  My step-sister has admitted she hasn't even talked to my dad in ###, and my step-brother has said he only got back in touch with my dad ###-###.  My brother called all the time and told my dad how to live, same thing he is still doing to us.When the step siblings came out they stole my mothers stuff and some of my children's stuff, though we cannot prove it since we cannot go look through what they shipped.  They even shipped my dads medications in their boxes.  The estate lawyer has informed me that the house we were living in is not part of probate, it is currently owed by the ###.  So my brother is not in charge of the house. In the beginning they offered to let us live there as long as we got rid of our cats, ones that were already living there including my dads cat.  We are still homeless.Through everything my family of ### (I was hospitalized due to heart conditions in ###) my brother (the executor) has still been informing that the way MY family left the house, the phone calls I make to the attorney and anything else I do to hold up the estate being settled, (even him telling me to do his job as executor without the authority to do it) will come out of my share of any inheritance.  The attorney told me that my brother cannot do that because everything is to be split ###.  The attorney said the probate court will tell my brother how to write the checks and confirm the amounts. Probate told me when I called that not all of that is true.  They will tell my brother to split it four ways, but they will not confirm he actually does it.  If I feel that I received the wrong amount, I would have to get an attorney and take him to court.  I cannot afford a place to live, we were hoping to use my share to get us a home, so how can I afford an attorney.  The magistrates office has told me since it is being done through text messages, phone calls and other people and they are all out of state, then the police cannot do anything.  We feel we are being harassed by my brother. 43712.7652777778 Thank you. The stopping of the harassment my brother is doing towards my family is my main concern though. He calls and texts telling us how to live our lives and uses the Bible to threaten us to live his way or else he will report us to the police. I have now just decided to change my whole families numbers. It seems the law is not on the side of those being harassed unless it is in state only. I thought it might be considered cyber bullying but I guess not. 43713.06875 Thanks for your reply.  I appreciate it.  I would respond as follows:If your brother cuts the checks in such a way that are clearly egregious, the Clerk will likely not approve the final ###, I should say, under the law, the Clerk SHOULD NOT approve the final accounting, since the executor is required to distribute evenly unless the will says otherwise, or if one of the heirs is the issue of a predeceased child of the testator, in which case the deceased child's share splits in fractional amounts according to the number of the testator's grandchildren through that predeceased child.  This is where reading the will very carefully will be essential to ascertaining whether the final distributions are correct.If your brother as executor consented to the ### valuable things being distributed a certain way, it is more likely than not that that is legal.  I cannot say for sure, obviously, but generally speaking, items of little monetary value, but of significant ### value, can be distributed according to the executor's discretion.  Usually, the Clerk of Court will not intervene as long as there is no manifestation of fraud by the executor.Hope that helps for informational purposes, although I realize that this might not altogether be pleasant given your disagreements with your brother.Be well,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43713.0541666667 The estate has an attorney and has given me much of the information about my dads estate. When my my brother cuts all the checks, the probate court does make sure all amounts are correct? Including the division to the heirs?The items taken were not of monetary value but memories and my childrenâ€™s items. We have no proof as they insisted on being left alone in my dads house to go through his things. My brother agreed with them. I did not know at the time that since we were still living there, that was illegal. The items were shipped in boxes to where they lived. Colorado and ###. 43713.0451388889 The items were given to me by my mother. My childrenâ€™s things they bought. They tried taking my husbands Army uniform saying it was their grandfathers, but as military uniforms do not look the same as they did back then...I have been told that since we were living there and had not yet been evicted, the items in the house were considered ours. The attorney for the estate has stated the house is not under the executor as it is not part of the probate. We lived there with my dad. It was our home. 43713.0576388889 Wow.  Very messy situation, for sure.  I honestly think you will need a lawyer's intervention in order to make this right (especially if a criminal referral to law enforcement does not yield productive results).  It sounds like your recourse would be to file a petition to the Clerk, demanding that the executor show cause" for allowing your personal property to be treated in such a way.  You would need to confirm this with a local probate lawyer since each Clerk's office deals with situations like this differently than others but that is likely the most cost-effective way to handle it.  You could do it yourself if you felt up to the challenge but having a lawyer would be far better if you can ever work out the finances in the near future.Best### A. ### ### Esq."43713.0652777778 I am representing myself in an adoption petition and termination of rights case in North Carolina. I have followed all steps and turned in all documentation requested by the courts. The biological father has been notified with proper notice. My wife, stepson, and I will all attend the hearing in two weeks. Besides being asked questions by the judge, Iâ€™d like to know what I need to bring to the hearing in preparation to answer any questions or concerns.

Did you obtain a divorce decree?  Did the court approve your custody agreement and visitation schedule?  Did you ask the court for spousal support?  Did the court divide your property and debts?You need an attorney to file for divorce on your behalf, ask for child support, ask for spousal support, formalize custody, and set a visitation schedule.  You also need the court to divide your marital property and marital debt.  With the amount of marital debt accumulated between you and your husband, in addition to the house, you need a clear determination of what is your debt and what is his.  It is possible that the court may order him responsible for the entirety or a majority.  Consult a family law attorney on division of property matters and the timing on declaring bankruptcy, if at all.The most important thing for you to do is find a family law attorney.  It is possible to proceed with filing for divorce, asking for custody/visitation, asking for spousal support (which you likely could qualify for), and asking for division of property pro se, meaning without an attorney, but it will be very difficult.  The court will hold you to the same standard as a lawyer and require you to abide by the Rules of Civil Procedure and Evidence.  Additionally, you will likely be required to produce tax documentation, debt documentation, and proof of your income and your husband's income among other things.  If that information is in your husband's control, and not yours, an attorney can help you obtain it if your husband is not cooperative. For your questions:Am I doing the correct things financially?  Your husband makes considerably more than you do, your home is marital property, the debt you have together is marital debt, and the debt you have in your name only may very well also be marital debt.  You need a court to divide the property and debt.  Since your husband makes much more than you do, and you stayed home to take care of your son, it is possible the court may determine most, or all, of the debt is your husband's responsibility.  You need to file for divorce, or if you already have a divorce decree, consult a family law attorney regarding division of property and debt.Do I qualify for spousal support?  Probably.  If you stayed home to care for your son, which is what you both decided for your family, and your husband makes more money then you do, it's very possible.  Much depends on your level of education, whether you are currently working to your potential, or whether your husband decides to insist that you wanted to stay at home, but he wanted you to work.  Should I file bankruptcy?  Perhaps, again, much depends on what property and debts you are allocated by the court.  Consult a family law attorney on division of property and timing of filing for bankruptcy, if at all.Is it a bad idea to move out of our home?  Maybe.  Consult a family law attorney before you move out as it is possible moving out may signal to the court some level of abandonment.  On the flip side, it could signal financial responsibility.  Ask a family law attorney first.Also, do not give" your home to your husband until a court rules that you must.  Your house is valuable property and the court may require your husband to buy your half of the house or that you sell the house and split any profit.  Either way the home is an important part of the division of marital property and may turn out to be an asset to you.Is our current custody agreement what's best for our child?  Without seeing your visitation schedule it is difficult to determine but you know what is best for your child.  Talk to a family law attorney to explore possible visitation schedules.  Also if your husband is leaving your son with his grandmother overnight this could impact how much child support your son receives since this decreases the time your husband spends with your son.  Child support is calculated based on the number of children you have the number of overnight days he spends with you your income your spouse's income child care costs health care costs extraordinary expenses and other factors.  Based on your representation of your husband's salary alone $500.###.  Again many factors impact child support and as such you need a lawyer to advocate on your behalf for each factor. While a family lawyer seems like an expense you cannot afford right now the amount of child support spousal support and potentially allocation of property a lawyer could help you gain will in the long run pay for the lawyer many times over.  For example if you agreed to $500.### but a lawyer helped you double that you would pay for your lawyer's fees over time and once you are finished the difference would be yours and your son's.  If you don't hire a lawyer you'll never see the difference.Consult a family law attorney before you agree to anything move out or declare bankruptcy.  Many lawyers will agree to payment plans over time discuss that during your consultation.  In answering your question I have not agreed to represent you or your claims.  In providing this information for your reference I consider the matter closed."43762.5583333333 Husband left ###. Came completely out of the blue. I was a stay at home mom for ### (this was something he wanted me to do; he didn't want our son in daycare anything), after he left I got a part time job at a library. We have ###, boy ###. We have a lot of debt, $50k. We bought our house in 2008, still owe $### on it. Not much equity in it. I make $10k per year, husband makes considerably more at $### per year. $30k debt is in my name alone, the rest is in either his name or our names together. House is in our name. We were married in 2007. We have been doing our custody as he gets our son every other weekend plus one day a week. He works all the time, hardly saw our son much even when he lived here (he is a salary employee). He claims there is no one ### affair. I've begged for counseling and reconciliation. I have been offered a rental house from a family friend that is in great condition, more affordable for my son and me, and is close by to our current home. I am considering giving our home to my husband and moving out. The house we own needs a lot of work and has a large yard that I struggle to maintain. Not enough equity to refinance with cash out or sell and make much on it. I am considering filing bankruptcy on my own to alleviate $30k of debt. He doesn't want to file.My questions are: am I doing the correct things financially? I don't want to mess up and realize it when it's too late. Do I qualify for spousal support? Should I file bankruptcy? Is it a bad idea to move out of our home? He hasn't resided in our home since ###. Is our current custody agreement what's best for our child? He misses his dad but with my husband's work schedule, family has never been a top priority for him. He prefers to be out doing things instead of being home with a child. Even during this short time we've been on this custody schedule, he has had to cancel or he's very late picking our child up, and most weekends he has him, he leaves him at my mother-in-law's home for most of the time. Husband has agreed to give me $###. He doesn't want to involve lawyers and I do not have the means to hire one at this time.I know this is a huge mess and I most certainly never saw my life taking this turn. I'm ashamed and embarrassed about my debt. I'm ### over the loss of my marriage. And I'm devastated for my son. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. 43713.1333333333 I have been a stay at home mom to ### (###) and ### (###) and found out my husband was cheating on me. we have been separated for ###, but ###. We are currently staying at my mom's house. What can or should I do now to get custody, child support and spousal support? 43713.1194444444 The fact that your husband emptied your bank account and opened a new account did not change the ownership of the money in the new account.  That money is still marital property and can be traced from the joint account to the new account.  I recommend you contact an attorney as soon as possible, or possibly NC Legal Aid if you are unable to afford an attorney, to protect your rights as far as the new account is concerned and the funds maintained in the account and being deposited into the ### should all still be considered marital property (entitling you to a share).43764.6104166667 My ex husband and I have 50/### ###. They go to school in my district which is in Greensboro and he lives in ###. Our schedule is ###, two days off though they come here every day after school - on his nights spending several hours. Yesterday the children let me know that he would be out of town for the most of the month of September and they will be staying here. He did not provide any notice. This has happened before. I am wondering now if I would be justified in seeking a change to our custody agreement since he cannot provide care on his days and nights. 43713.2194444444 The key word in your question is agreement."  If you do not have a court order that governs custody the agreement is not something that can be enforced in court.  If you decide not to follow it anymore he cannot call law enforcement or have you held in contempt of court.  Rather he would need to begin a custody proceeding in court.  If he did that what you have been doing the last several years is not that important to what a judge will decide to do regarding custody.  It's basically starting on a clean slate.  So think hard about whether you want that to happen if you decide to change what you've been doing."43735.7166666667 Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Infidelity also commonly referred to as criminal conversation" or "adultery is the act of sexual relations with the spouse of another, or for a married person, any other person besides one's spouse.  Since adultery is almost never witnessed in person (although it can at times), it can be proven through circumstantial ### as emails, texts, love notes, and other tangible evidence of sexual intimacy.  It can also be proven by testimony of private investigators hired to monitor the relationship fro###lawful distance, or the wronged spouse if s/he personally observes clues that the other spouse engaged in marital misconduct.  There need not be a direct line of evidence of the actual physical act, so long as there is enough circumstantial evidence to make a compelling case that adultery did indeed occur.  It is ultimately up the court as to what evidence should be admitted, and for what probative purpose, pursuant to the North Carolina Rules of Evidence.In North Carolina, there are only two kinds of ### based on insanity of one of the spouses, and divorce based on separation of one year.  Where infidelity can be relevant is in the decision to award alimony, and how much.  I include here a link to N.C.G.S. Â§ ###, which shows all the reasons a District Court judge can award alimony against a spouse in a divorce proceeding.  Note that adultery would fall under marital misconduct" under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###(b)(1).https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_50/GS_###.pdfThis is a brief general answer to your question but a family law attorney whom you might hire in the future who would become far more familiar with the details of your situation than I am can provide you a much more detailed forecast of what to expect if you hope to leverage the issue of adultery in a divorce proceeding.Blessings and best wishes to you this fall.### A. ### ### Esq."43714.0652777778 Under NC law, what is considered infidelity and how is it proven?

Truth be told I do have a current attorney but he is leaving the firm. My wife and I have been seperated over ###. I have agreee to take our unsecured credit card debts in exchange for her dismissing a pending contempt against me. We seperated due to me assaulting her.

Any advise is greatly appreciated"43713.925 Mr. ###,It sounds like your prior attorney recommended the correct approach to ensure you continue to have custodial rights of your child. She cannot withhold your child if an order is in place.It is difficult to say how successful you would be without an attorney. I think you should discuss with your current attorney what he expects the future costs in the case would be, whether they can take your case with them to their new firm or if they have a referral attorney to send you too. You can proceed without an attorney. You may try to contact Legal Aid NC to see if they can help you.  43764.6173611111 ### I have the original copy he could not kick me and my two ### ### who are listed as ### out is this correct??43714.6083333333 Do you have an original will that can be filed with the Clerk?  If so, do that.  A will has no authority until the Clerk admits it to probate. I do not know what you mean by both certified copies?"  Who certified what and how does that relate to the Clerk probating a will?"43714.7597222222 I cannot read the copies you posted, but I have some doubt that this is really a will.  It looks as if it could be a trust.  Is the property in the Trust?  Is there a will?  If there is no will to move the property into the trust and it is not already in the trust, your trust does not do anything.43714.6583333333 I have both Certified copys43714.7027777778 If you have the original will, take it to the Clerk of Court and they will help you get it admitted to probate.

Until then, it is nothing and obligates no one.43714.6569444444 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  While I do not know much about Florida law, I can tell you that if you wish to obtain a divorce fro###North Carolina court, you must be physically separated for at least one year, and one of the spouses in the divorce lawsuit must have been a North Carolina resident for at least six months.  Without these requirements being met, you cannot be divorced in North Carolina.Separation is defined as maintaining distinct and apart physical residences, and cessation of regular sexual relations.  You can, but are not necessarily required to, have a separation agreement (recommended if you can agree and have one drafted by a lawyer).  Once a year has passed, you should contact a family law attorney to prepare the divorce lawsuit for you.  If at the time of the divorce you cannot afford an attorney, some courthouses in North Carolina offer ### packets of what to file and when.  It is not as efficient as being represented, but still possible if necessary.I hope this answers your question.  Have a blessed fall, and if you have any questions for detailed discussion during the interim period, always feel free to consult with a family law attorney.Be well,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43714.6305555556 I was married in Florida and do I have to go through a separation or can i just get divorced43714.5659722222 I am sorry to hear about your problems.  It sounds as if you have a complaint about how your lawyer in Texas handled your custody case in Texas.You may be able to file a complaint with the Texas State Bar if you believe your lawyer acted unethically.  You may also have some type of claim directly against your lawyer about how your case was handled.  You would, however, need to consult with a Texas attorney about these matters.  Unfortunately, I do not have a resource in Texas to direct you to for assistance.  You might try calling Legal Aid in Texas to see if they can refer you to someone who can advise you as to your legal options.Best of luck.43735.7243055556 I had a custody case that went on for little over ###.  The lawyer I brought my case to told me I needed to act quickly to get my son out of the household he was in the cops had been out to the residents he was staying at 40+ times in ###. we had several problems thoughout the case with the lawyer handeling the case.  I am unsure what my legal options are.  Throughout the case it was difficult for me to get updates about my case and where we stood.  One of the biggest problems I had was I felt my lawyer didn't properly represent me and I didn't feel he kept me in the loop of what was going on.  there was a court date scheduled and I didn't find out about it until ###.  Another instance was we were suppose to meet for mediation so my lawyer told me I didn't have to be there but then he ended up settling but we had evidence that I had payed child support from the time my son was born but he didn't say anything when my sons mother told the judge I hadn't paid child support as a result we have to pay back pay on top of a increased child support rate.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m going to alternative way in a affidavit of offense and in elements and signing it. 43714.7923611111 ###,An attorney would be a wise decision because you seem to have four issues: (###) filing for divorce, (###) requesting child support, (###) division of property, and (###) a suit for alienation of affection.  Likely, a family law attorney could handle, or assist with, most of these issues.  It's possible that they would recommend you find a plaintiff's attorney to bring your alienation of affection action.  Ask your friends and family for recommendations for a good family law attorney and proceed from there.While it is possible to file for divorce pro se, meaning by yourself without an attorney, it would be difficult.  The court would treat you as if you were an attorney, holding you to the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Additionally, requesting child support, in addition to filing for divorce, makes the proceedings more difficult.  To obtain the best possible support for your child, an attorney is recommended.  Have you considered seeking alimony as well?  A family law attorney can help.Often, in divorce matters, property is divided between the parties.  It's possible your husband may claim that, even though he is not listed on the mortgage, he is part owner of your home and your home is marital property.  Simply removing him from the deed of trust will not negate his marital property claim.  Talk to a family law attorney as determining whether property is marital or individual can be complicated.In North Carolina, suing in civil court for alienation of affection requires proof that (###) there was a marriage with love and affection existing between the husband and wife; (###) that love and affection was alienated; and (###) the malicious acts of the defendant produced the loss of that love and affection.  The third portion of alienation of affection, that defendant acted maliciously, is difficult to prove.  You will need to discuss the circumstances of your husband's infidelity with an attorney, start with your family law attorney, to decide whether the situation warrants a civil lawsuit for monetary damages.Best of luck.  In answering this question, I have not agreed to represent you or your claims, and I recommend that you consult a family law attorney.  With that recommendation, I consider this matter closed.43762.5270833333 I have been separated from my husband for over a year due to his infidelity.

Of Social Services, Child Support Enforcement office.  The primary point of contact would be to establish child support for your ###; however, in my experience, DSS will readily be able to steer you into the child custody mediation program which can be readily handled without an attorney.

As to the second question, one would have to read the healthcare power of attorney to see if it contains any advance directive language that authorizes the agent to make decisions regarding ###, anatomical donations and/or funeral arrangements.  Some healthcare ### specify the principal's wishes on these matters, and others are silent on the matter (in which case, the decedent's next-of-kin heirs make funeral decisions, unless there is a will or trust that directs otherwise).Best,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43718.125 Ms. ###:Thank you for this very important question involving your mother.  Yes, you can always file for guardianship with the Clerk of Superior Court in the county where your mother resides, but if the niece has already been designated as your mother's agent and/or healthcare agent under a general and healthcare power of attorney, respectively, the burden will be on you in proving that you are more suitable to be your mother's guardian, and also that the niece cannot be trusted to act as your mother's fiduciary based on past conduct (as opposed to suspicions or opinions based on secondhand information).  Many power of attorney instruments contain guardianship clauses that say, in effect, that if a guardianship action is ever filed before the Clerk, the person signing the POA ### the agent or healthcare agent to act as guardian of the person or guardian of the estate (finances).  It is still up to the Clerk as to whether to honor that ###, but, all things being equal, the Clerk will generally side with the ### agent, unless there is credible, factual evidence that the ### agent is unfit or unqualified to be guardian.This is a very detailed analysis that you will need legal representation for should you decide to move forward in challenging the POA's authority.  Technically, you can do this yourself, but this would be a lot to take on without legal counsel.  What you need at this point is a more detailed discussion of the factors I have briefly touched upon ### person with an experienced fiduciary litigation lawyer, in a confidential setting.  What needs to be more carefully vetted is whether you are likely to win in a guardianship lawsuit than the niece.  While the answer to that question would seem ### given your relationship as daughter, it may not be so, depending on the facts, and how hard each side fights this battle.Reach out to my friend ### Walls of The Walls Law Firm in ###.  ### is deeply experienced in this kind of legal dispute, and will provide you accurate advice.  Here is a link to his law firm page:###If you reach out to him, let him know that I strongly recommended you to him.God bless you and your family during this challenging time.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43718.0805555556 My mom has been diagnosed with dementia and her family is all of sudden concerned about her finances but weren't previously before finding out her diagnosis, so they have talked her into letting a niece of hers who is an accountant (I feel they can steal the most b/c they work with numbers everyday)become her General POA  when she has never been active in my mom's life before and doesn't take her to medical appts or any other appt for that matter, I do (her daughter) and has always done so ever since her diagnosis and her not being able to drive. They have accused me of stealing lots of money from her. I helped find someone to purchase my mom's condo and found a apartment for her to move to and helped her move and this niece was no where in sight. They have gone to the lengths of putting some of my moms money on a prepaid American Express card and this niece knows nothing's about my mom's medical history to be over her medical decisions.43717.8652777778 So what if something happens to her medically her niece doesn't know her medical history to make any decisions on her behalf b/c she hasn't been there so what happens then? Or what if she passes away does that POA mean the niece is to make funeral arrangements and all of that?43718.0875 Hi, it's ### ### again.  I think it is fine for you to e-mail the estate attorney and tell him that you cannot sign an agreement that delays payment by more than ###, and explain why.  I think we are in agreement that a special needs trust does not help -- the main reason is that you still don't have the money so it does not address the problem.  But, you don't need to lock it up if you can spend it within the month you receive it.  Be clear with the attorney that this is an important time deadline and you are fine with the amount.The rule is that he cannot talk directly with you if you have an attorney.  If you do not have an attorney, and you do not, he is free to discuss this directly with you.  You might consider sending him and e-mail with the general information and then ask to set a time to talk with him about the mechanics and details of the settlement.43718.5652777778 Hi, thank you for your time.  My question concerns responding to a settlement offer without an attorney in an unexpectedly contentious estate.Am I allowed to request changes to a settlement agreement without an attorney of my own to advise me? I am concerned with formatting it correctly & legal language. I am worried it may make me vulnerable to losing my payment or something worse. I am worried about what happens if I donâ€™t respond too.Background:  Since May have received pressure & harassment to sign settlement agreement benefiting executor & harming me.  It is not about amount; it is about timing.  He wants to wait to pay us until the end of ### & other financial purposes on his end.  Signing it now, apparently, makes it an official asset for me even if I canâ€™t access it for months. This would cause me to lose health coverage. In response, the estate attorney keeps telling me to get a special needs trust.  I checked & was told costs $1000+ & they advised against it because this is a small trust amount, I am not permanently disabled at this time with no plans to file, & I have a plan to spend down the money within ###.Next, I shared my story on here in relation to a question about threats the executor made against me accusing me of Medicaid fraud.  The volunteer attorney was very helpful in reviewing communications & offering information.I followed the suggestion to block all messages from executor & direct harassment has stopped.  However, I am getting messages from others that heâ€™s saying untrue things in public. Today, the estate attorney messaged me seeming to believe them as truth.The executor is telling people I am holding out trying to get more money from him. I have all of my communications saying the same thing; I will accept $###.  I was advised by Medicaid that ideally the money will be fully distributed within ### (Max ###) days of signature.  I would avoid interruption in services by â€œspending downâ€ the full amount within that month.  When this was first communicated to the executor, he agreed to â€œexpedite the payment.â€ However, the official settlement I was offered has required a signature since May & no payment until ###. He said timeline is due to my delays & his preference. If needed, I can provide copy of settlement document.This is my grandfatherâ€™s estate & we were first notified we were beneficiaries in ######.  We were told to expect a check within ###. I called & was informed executor had made no progress. Within a few weeks, he was in a hurry to force this settlement.My goal is to respond in a way that meets my needs of signing & receiving payment within ### (maybe ###).  This attorney suggested to sit on it & sign closer to that timeline but after todayâ€™s letter from estate lawyer, I donâ€™t think the executor is going to let that happen.43717.9326388889 My ex husband has filed for custody for my ###. ### ###. He has filed for custody because he no longer wants to pay child support. He is only paying for ###. I was previously married to my first husband when my ###st child was born. My first husband wouldn't sign the divorce papers so NC state law says that my ###st child is legally my first husband. Well he finally signed the divorce papers yrs later but my second son was conceived before the divorce was final which also makes my second son legally his as well. By this time I am married to my current ex husband we have another son and it is legally his and he signed the birth certificate that is why he is only required to pay child support for ###. How can he file for custody if the children are not legally his? Also he has petition the other Father's in the custody petition as well. But for my one son who is not biologically his how will that work? If the Father's don't respond how does that work? Also he has an attorney and I don't because I can't afford one. What should I do or know when representing myself in this matter? Also can I ask for sole custody in this matter? The only reason this is occurring is because he doesn't want to pay child support and also he is upset that after ###. I need help because this is a big mess! Will I loose custody of my children? I don't want him to even have joint custody. We don't have any agreement when it comes to the children. I allow him to pick them up when he wants them and for yrs there hasn't been any disagreement.

The standard in child custody is what is in the best interests of the child.  I recommend you seek advice of free legal service in North Carolina, such as NC Legal Aid or any various law school clinics that can help you challenge any custody petition your husband might file.  Since he is living with his parents, has no income, and you appear to be ### suited to identify your son's medical conditions, it seems to be in the child's best interests for you to have primary custody of the child.  Again, I recommend you seek advice and retain legal counsel to help you in court.  If you are not able to secure counsel, you have good arguments in court that you should have primary custody and that all of your time spent with your child in the hospital should not count against your time with your child from a custody perspective.  Your primary custody argument is ### by the fact that it does not make sense to split custody in the traditional sense since your child's medical needs does not necessary lend itself to splitting or dividing custody in a traditional manner.43764.61875 I am looking forward for someone to contact me regarding my inquiry.

My daughter is ### 7th grade.During the past year he has been taking the kids to spend some hours with him on the weekends. However, due to serious illness of my son, he gets sick most of the time and we get admitted in the hospital for week or two.      On ### while we are in the hospital, he has accused me falsely that I pushed him and the entire situation turned out to be against him and the police put him in jail for one night.My husband is claiming that he does not have a job or income and he lives with his family (he has many siblings in the area). My husband has filed for child custody and the orientation day was scheduled while I was admitted in the hospital for two weeks with my son. I asked to postponed it till I get out. Now it is scheduled for ###. During this time, I have received the hearing for child custody case which is scheduled for ###, however we filed a motion on ### to postponed it, but we have not received response yet from the judge.

Physical custody is having the right to physically care for your child. Legal custody is having the right to make major decisions for your child.            Since there is a disagreement between you and the father of your sonâ€™s continuing psychological treatment, you would need to file a motion for sole legal custody in order to be the sole ### in your sonâ€™s psychological treatment.

I found out ###. My son's father is not psychologically stable and still insists my son needs treatment. I completely disagree and told him that if he wants treatment to continue, he can no longer use the Medicaid I applied for and he needs to self pay. Can he continue to use my son's Medicaid even if he doesn't appear on the card? Do both parents need to consent to psychological treatment in NC?43720.4972222222 Hi ###. I am sorry to hear that you are in a difficult situation. Hopefully I can provide you with some direction. In North Carolina, natural parents have the primary custodial rights to their children. So, if there is no existing custody order your rights may be superior to the grandmother's rights. I would have to know a lot more about how you got to this situation to address it any further. To move forward with no existing custody order, you would have to file a Custody Complaint, and seek a custody order granting you some form of custody. Both the child's mother and grandparent that has current custody should be served with a copy of the Complaint. Most courts have pro se forms for unrepresented parties to file these cases. But it would be more efficient for you to hire a family law attorney to assist you. You would have to evaluate what county the case could be filed at depending on where the various parties live. In regard to emergency custody, that is only typically available where there is a likelihood of irreparable harm to a child. If the child is in a safe environment, emergency custody may not be available in your jurisdiction. Much depends on the facts of your particular case.  43763.7854166667 How as a father get emergency custody daughter lives with grandmother and the mother isn't around am I able to get her if no custody is in place 43720.6805555556 Should I allow the mother of my child file for child support or make an out of court deal to pay a certain amount per month?

He is ###.43721.6611111111 Whether or not she is entitled to child support is at the discretion of the court. According to state law, you will not be able to prevent her from filing for child support. If she is entitled to child support, the court will grant that. I do not recommend negotiating a payment plan outside of court because it is outside of the court's enforcement. If issues are raised on if you have paid child support, it will be difficult to prove. 43763.7652777778 Generally speaking, family law rights don't begin until there is a physical separation between husband/wife or mom/dad.  Because you are still living under the same roof, you are really not in the family law arena.  Once you move out, you will be.  At that time, you will be entitled to child support for your child and may be entitled to alimony for you.  You may want to go to a Legal Aid ### clinic for child custody.

In that situation, it doesn't matter to whom the cars are titled.  They are considered marital property and belong to you both equally.

You just need to create a form that has your case caption at the top (e.g., plaintiff, defendant, county, case number, etc.) and write out your motion for clarification under Rule ###.  If you contend that there has been a substantial change in the circumstances, then you can find a form here for a motion to modify custody/visitation: ###.It is uncertain whether the judge will consider the motion or actually clarify the order.  There is a very narrow set of circumstances under which a judge has the authority to clarify or modify an order.  I have attached a court opinion discussing a similar situation.  That opinion may be helpful to determine whether your Rule ###.  Ultimately, the best thing you can do is to consult a local attorney to help you with this situation.

I'm an intern at ### Healthcare in ### contacting you on behalf of a client. This client has to go to court in ### for child custody mediation. Our client is low- to no-income and cannot afford a lawyer. His child's mother contacted Legal Aid of NC to represent her, and today our client reported that he cannot be represented by Legal Aid NC because this creates a conflict of interest. The client did not report whether this is something Legal Aid told him or something his child's mother told him, so I'm curious as to whether or not this is accurate, for one. I contacted Legal Aid but the man on the phone was unable to provide me with remotely sufficient information. So my question is if this conflict of interest is genuine and my client truly cannot be represented by Legal Aid; and if he cannot, then if there are other similar services where he could receive free or reduced legal help due to his lack of income.43724.7006944444 Legal Aid of NC rarely is involved in family law.  Generally, they only get involved when the case starts as a domestic violence protection case, and then they can proceed with custody in rare circumstances.  In the rare cases where Legal Aid of NC does get involved, they can only represent one party to the action.  So yes, if one parent is approved for Legal Aid of NC, then the other parent cannot be represented by Legal Aid of NC.  For a low income client in ### County, have them contact Gate City Legal Services, Inc., ###/, a low-bono non-profit in Greensboro.### ### ###43726.8513888889 Awesome, Sir!

We have been separated since ######. I have joint legal custody of our to minor children. She has physical custody. There is no visitation order in place. Mediation failed. Child support has already been established by the court. She is seeking Alimony and spousal support, although she worked full time, in her field of study, before separation, and holds a Master's degree which I helped her get. She has an attorney but I don't know how she can afford it. I cannot afford an attorney and have been proceeding as indigent. I have a bachelor's degree but I am disabled. I receive Va compensation. I haven't held gainful employment since May of 2013. We've been married since ###03. Her earnings ### mine before separation. I don't know what she does now as we have no effective communication.

And I really just want this nightmare over so we can all move on with our lives. Please help, thank you for your attention.43725.5680555556 Mr. ###:Thank you for your question; it is a very important one.  While I do not regularly practice family law, and do suggest that at some point you at least consult once with a local family law attorney (even if you are unable or unwilling to retain an attorney for the long ###), I can offer a couple points about settlement offers generally, since I do practice civil litigation, and most if not all rules of civil procedure and evidence apply to family law matters as civil proceedings.

Here is what NC Rule of Evidence ###:Rule ###. Compromise and offers to compromise. NC General Statutes - Chapter ### ### (###000487) furnishing or offering or promising to furnish or (###000652) accepting or offering or promising to accept a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either validity or amount is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount.

This rule does not require the exclusion of any evidence otherwise ### merely because it is presented in the course of compromise negotiations. This rule also does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness ### a contention of undue delay or proving an effort to ### a criminal investigation or prosecution.You will be fine in ###s of your offer not being used against you to de###ine liability but what you still need fro### in-person discussion with counsel goes more to the substance of what a deal might look like based on what you know of your and your spouse's situation.

Great information. I feel better and I will certainly contact the gentleman you mentioned today! 43725.7638888889 If you fail to follow the portions of the child custody order pertaining to you, yes, you will be in contempt of court and can be punished accordingly.  That is true whether or not he has himself violated portions of the order.  If you want to change the custody order, you will need to file a motion to modify.  If you want to have him held in contempt for failing to follow his portions of the order, you will need to file a motion to show cause as to why he should not be held in contempt.43735.6979166667 My ex and I currently have a joint custody arrangement that is court ordered. My ex has not complied with the visitation portion of the order. He has also violated multiple rules in the parental agreement. For instance, he has refused to disclose his address, he has allowed his significant other to meet our child prior to meeting me. He no shows for times to meet etc. Will I be in contempt if I choose to keep our daughter with me until we are able to get the order modified? He is refusing to go back to child custody court and I don't have means to serve him since I do not know his whereabouts.43725.5868055556 A CPS investigation, sheriff's wellness check, and violation of the Custody Order alone are not enough to warrant a child custody modification. And based on whether the Order is Temporary or Permanent the standard of proof necessary to modify the Order will vary. Your Ex's violation of the custody Order is grounds for asking the court to hold him in contempt, which can later be used again him in a child custody action. I would recommend getting a family law attorney to represent you in this matter, and if your child is being abused or neglected then you and your attorney can file action on behalf of your child against their father. Child advocacy lawyers would only be necessary to act in a guardian ad litem role if the parents could not agree about filing an action against a third party or if the child was filing against both parents. If are seeking inexpensive legal representation then you should contact Legal Aid by calling your local office or visiting www.legalaidnc.org. I hope this helps.Best regards,43763.7951388889 Is having a CPS investigation and a sheriff's wellness check as well as violation of the custody agreement grounds for modifying a custody agreement?

Typically, back child support can be pursued in the jurisdiction where the existing Child Support Order was entered. One would need to file a Motion in the Cause for contempt. Most North Carolina courts have forms for pursuing these claims. You can check the NC AOC website's form section ( ### ) that might provide you with the Motion in the Cause. Under North Carolina law back child support that is owed pursuant to a court order is vested. This means that he can not modify the back support owed to you. You just need to seek enforcement of that amount owed through the court. (###) The second issue is the father's Motion to Modify Child Support based upon a change in circumstances. Of course, the change in circumstances appears to be that the children no longer reside with you and now reside with him. That entitles him to modify the child support court order. The court will evaluate any new support order based upon the circumstances existing at the time of the new court date. Whats most important for you is to get your Motion to Enforce Child Support Order filed so that it can be heard at the same time as his Motion to Modify Child Support. Then the court can address both issues at the same time. 43763.7569444444 I had the children for ###. The father was suppose to pay ###'t. The father owes over ###. The father in turn had me up for child support now that he has the children. 43727.7840277778 Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  Out of an abundance of caution, I would not cease paying alimony if your obligation to do so is ongoing per the court's orders, as that will weaken your hand when you need to enforce the prior order for your wife to remove your name from the title and refinance within six months.  If your ex-wife has not followed the judge's orders with respect to the refinance and re-title timeline, you will need to reappear in front of the judge to compel your ex-wife's compliance.  I think you should consult in person with a local family law attorney in ### County (hopefully one who will not charge you too much for a consult and maybe even short-term representation for a court hearing), and share a copy of the judge's order.  At this point, I cannot think of anything other than a reappearance before the District Court judge to enforce the order.  If the ex-wife does not abide by the order, eventually the judge might hold her in contempt, which would be very serious for her. I am sorry you are in this situation, but fortunately, it is fixable.  Gather up a couple or few hundred dollars, and see what the local family law attorneys in ### County might charge for a little assistance on this matter.Wishing and praying the best things in life for you this fall.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43728.1048611111 My ex wife got the house in the settlement of our property.

And can I stop paying her until she fixes this problem. Thanks43727.8618055556 I will assume for purposes of answering this question, that you claim ownership over the property you reference. In North Carolina, in order to be finalize a divorce, you must be separated for one year. To commence and formalize the separation, among other things, a separation agreement is required. In the final stages of the process, the marital property will be distributed; however, at this point, using the separation agreement as leverage to withhold your claimed property is improper. Navigating the divorce process is complex and can be difficult on your own. I would recommend strongly if you have the opportunity, to consult with an attorney about the entirety of the process. In the meantime, absent having a lawyer to serve a demand letter for your property, you should contact law enforcement as your former spouse is essentially wrongfully withholding your claimed property.43764.6020833333 We seperated and he said he was gonna return the items he has but now he says he is not going to.

When I left, I found out I was pregnant again with our youngest daughter. Throughout my pregnancy, the father was not there but was inconsistent with getting our oldest. That went on for months up until now. He does not stay consistent with getting the girls every other week.

At the begging of this year we talked again, and the father decided he would like to get them every other weekend again. But would only keep the youngest until Saturday night or Sunday morning before church and say I needed to get her because he could not preach with her there but our oldest could stay until after church. This went on until May, after my birthday weekend he hasnâ€™t not offered to get them or communicate with me about seeing the girls. We went to court for child support and things began to get worse. He would continue to say negative things to hurt me because of court. He would say I am keeping the girls from seeing him, however the two times he has asked to get them we were gone out of town and the other we had plans. As of today, he does not spend time with them or get them, nor does he communicate with me at all. I do allow the girls to FaceTime he as much as we can with our busy schedule since school as started. I have tried on so many occasions to discuss with the father about an agreement but he does not want to talk. I had no choice but to file for custody and get the courts involved to help me with mediation. So that we can come to a common place for the sake of the girls. What is the best way to go about this situation? Should I continue to reach out to him? Or just let the judge decide?43729.5715277778 Attached is our Colorado order. I have a custody order from the state of Colorado. I want to domesticate the order to North Carolina. I have the forms for the petition and plan to start the process this week. My question is if I file the petition and the other parent tries to file any petitions in Colorado will it prohibit me from moving the case? Even if I already filed and served him the petition? I know if there is on going litigation in Colorado I will not be able to move the case, but what if he starts litigation after I file my petition? If he comes to North Carolina before I file this petition what are the laws about enforcing the Colorado orders? And what are the tiles concerning contempt of court? This case involves ###, who have not seen the other parent since ###. And have no spoken to him either. Visitation is supposed to be monthly and daily phone calls. He has made no attempt to be in their lives since ###. Thank you. 43731.7215277778 The domestication of the order is a separate process from the other ongoing litigation. Further petitions in CO should not impact N.C. courts jurisdiction to domesticate the CO order so it can be enforced in NC and the other parties presence in NC could help the NC court to determine there is jurisdiction. The laws you requested is the nc uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act. 43764.6076388889 My son was conceived to another man while I was legally married to my ex-husband (separated at the time of ### and divorced before the birth). I have filed for child support from the biological father but Child support have told me that they are legally obliged to go after my ex-husband to rule out paternity before going after the biological father. This is despite the birth certificate stating Husbands name refused, an affidavit of paternity for biological father, divorce certificate stating that only ###, which are our own ###, not this child. All this is because of a North Carolina law.So, my question is about custody. Who do I need to persue to gain full custody of my child? The legal father, or the biological one? Which one can claim custody of my child? Can they both? I have applied for custody against the biological father but want to confirm this is the right person. Does the biological father even have any legal rights to my child? Thank you### ### 43732.7895833333 You'll need to pursue a paternity action against the biological father.43746.9833333333 My late brothers son's mother is trying her very hardest to keep us out of my nephew's life. We've been humble for the past ###. He is ###, my brother.  His mother is trying to keep up a lie to please her fiance rather than help her son's sanity in knowing where he came from. We would like him to receive my brother's social security benefits but she's making it extremely hard for us to be there for him.43733.5680555556 Unfortunately, your nephew's mother has complete authority over who can visit him while he is a minor (under age ###).  As an uncle, you do not have any legal visitation rights.  Under some limited circumstances, grandparents can force visitation with a grandchild, so your parents might be able to gain some access to the child.  Short of that, you will need to wait until your nephew turns ###--at that point, he is a legal adult and will be free to associate with whomever he wants.  43764.6027777778 Hi, me and my daughter mom share joint custody of my daughter but I have physical custody of her ### in north Carolina  . We went to court about this issue back in ###. My daughter recently came to north Carolina and took my daughter back because I had a dss case because I disciplined my ###. A dss person came to my home and did the routine they do and they let my daughter stay with me because there wasn't any signs of abuse . My daughter mom has my daughter in New York and she didn't respect the court order we had in place , I dont believe she can just come and take my daughter back to New York when my daughter been living in north Carolina for about ###. I now have a summons to appear in family court in New York because my daughter mom want sole custody of our daughter.  I want to know can she just do what she did and what can I do about it...43734.4569444444 Jurisdiction can change if the child stayed in NY more than six months prior to filing the order, the order in NC is still valid and will need to be registered in NY.  You also have the option of filing a show cause in NC and have her served with court proceedings in NC. You really need to get a lawyer in NC and you should be present in court in NY as well, if you were served. The issue is who has jurisdiction at this point. Will ### respect the NC order, it will be totally up to the judge. If you can get her back to NC, that is the easiest way, but if not you may have to fight the action in NY. Even, if the judge in NC orders the child to be returned it will be up to the NY state police/sheriff to adhere and assist. You really need to seek counsel.43740.0854166667 I would recommend that you reach out to the Legal Aid of North Carolina office located in ###, ### street is ###, ###, NC ###.  Mailing address is PO Box ###, ###, NC ###.  The local phone number is ###-###.  That office supports and serves citizens in ### County.  They help caretakers protect the rights of the child and their services are free.  There are income restrictions but based on what you stated you make you should be able to qualify.  In addition, I would recommend that you reach out to child protective services to inform them of what is going on. Child protective services and legal aid can talk with you about the various resources that are available to assist you in caring for your granddaughter.  Since the child is older they can talk with her about how she feels about her father and advise regarding next steps.  Normally, a court is unwilling to sever parental rights but since he has not contributed and may be suffering from mental disease or defect they may in this case award you full guardianship which would help you qualify for services to assist with caring for the child.  43766.7493055556 My granddaughter (age 12), has lived with me for over ###., due to her mother (my daughter) and father being drug addicts and homeless.

I showed up for court this morning and she did not show up. The court told me I can't get a divorce unless she shows up so we rescheduled for ###. I really don't expect her to show up on that date either as she is chasing a drug addiction and that seems to be all she cares about. She hasn't even seen our child who I now have temporary custody of in months. I have no idea where she is. From what the clerk of courts told me it sounds to me like she can keep me a hostage to this marriage if she chooses not to show up. They told me I can't file. They recommended I get an attorney but I am on disability and taking care of my child so there is no way I can afford an attorney and legal aid in NC does not assist with divorce. Is there anything I can do on my own to get this divorce if she doesn't show for court?43734.6986111111 Thank you for your reply. I intend to go to the next court date. If the judge will not finalize it I will take your advice and file on my own with the packet from legal aid. 43740.0194444444 The statements are not true, if you are not contesting the Divorce and the divorce has been filed they should be able to move forward.There are self help divorces packages you can get from legal aid as well to help you file your own action.

If you decide after the divorce is final that you want to change your name back, you will need a copy of your divorce decree and a completed application to change your name. I've included below the form of application to resume your former name provided by the North Carolina courts: https://www.nccourts.gov/assets/documents/forms/sp600-en.pdf?XUSPvW4vkA7tcOwEkQXzai331OUqmdxi. The application would be filed with the local clerk of court in ### County (if that is where you live) - the contact information for the Court can be found here - https://www.nccourts.gov/locations/###-county/###-county-courthouse.  There will be a fee associated with the filing, and you can contact the clerk of court for the amount in advance if you wish. Thank you, and have a pleasant Thanksgiving.  43796.8326388889 In the divorce decree, there is a space to be able to change your name back to the maiden name. I am not sure right now if I want to change my last name since I have used my married name for ###. Should I check the box anyway and make the decision later or am I required to make the change if the box is checked?Thank you.43782.7444444444 If there is a signed contract in writing that stated they would be responsible for the fees, you can file a claim. If the amount is less than $10,###, but if the amount is an excess of $10,000, it can be filed in district or superior court. If there is no contract, I recommend you speak with an attorney because filing a legal claim will be much more difficult. 43763.7576388889 In ###, and part of placing according to the agency I went through was that the adoptive parents would pay all hospital fees for the birth and doctors up to ###. The adoptive parents have made one payment, and after discussing the issue with the doctor's office and adoption agency, each person I spoke with had assured me it would be taken care of. Fast forward to today and I find a derogatory public record affecting my credit score due to the hospital ###s remaining unpaid. The agency no longer responds to me, and if I had the money to pay the ###s, then I never would have chosen adoption. I am looking for help in figuring out what my options are because I am a full time graduate student, so I am not in a position to pay the ### myself, and my credit score has plummeted due to this being on my record. 43738.0694444444 ### ###'t proven, dss was unprofessional and failed to communicate with me but did through other ### told that information i tell to her cannot be repeated to absent parent" but ### fuel to gain custody of child was sought i followed safety plan ### was prolonged purposely to build in home case safety plan wasn't clear where i wasnt told group was mandatory after assessment lies were told amongst the father and case workers since case my daughter missed a funeral of close relative that was purposely potential supervisor wasn't ### alot of info wasnt shared with me.

I have paper work dates witnesses recordings to fight it."43738.5798611111 Thank you for your question.  I see that you had mediation set for ###, so I don't know if that occurred or not.  In preparing for mediation, the best thing is to have your information and documents organized in a logical manner so that you can present things clearly to the mediator.  If mediation was not successful, you are going to need legal assistance to get full custody.  Unfortunately, that is not something that can be answered easily because there are so many facts that would be involved as well as documents to be filed with the court.  In a custody case, the court is going to evaluate the matter based on the best interests of the child. I would recommend obtaining a local attorney, or perhaps contacting the North Carolina Bar Association and ask for their attorney referral program.43764.5993055556 Good evening, Mrs. ###:Thank you for this very important question.  In the absence of a separation agreement that governs which spouse is responsible for what, you are liable to the extent that your names are on the accounts that you mentioned, and any others.  If both of your names are on the utility account, for example, you both are liable insofar as the utility co###y is concerned (unless you or Mr. ### change that by contacting its customer service department), but if Mr. ### decides not to pay, the utilities could be cut off if you do not pay the bills in full (subject of course to the normal grace periods usually applicable in these matters).  If there is a mortgage or car loan at issue in which both names are listed as the ### or mortgagors, both parties are still responsible for making those payments, absent a court order or separation agreement that specifies otherwise.  If this is truly going to be a long-### separation in contemplation of a divorce, it is advisable that you and Mr. ### execute a joint separation and property settlement agreement.  It is essential that you have legal counsel for this if you both wish to do this properly; that will iron out difficulties in the future during the one-year separation required in North Carolina, and will make the actual divorce much easier to obtain.So in the short ###, you may be stuck with the bills pertaining to the home if your husband does not contribute to the household, although that can change if you get the court involved by seeking spousal support during the separation.  You would probably need a family law attorney for this, since it would be quite difficult to navigate this in court on your own.  There are a number of factors that a District Court judge would take into account before deciding whether one spouse should support the other during and after the separation and divorce proceedings.  So first, de###ine whether there is any realistic chance of marital reconciliation in this, or whether this is really headed towards a divorce after one year of living apart and ceasing marital relations.  If so, you will need to retain a family law attorney in the near future.Blessings to you and your child as you work through these difficulties, which I am sure you will negotiate well with time.  I wish you all the very best.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43738.9340277778 Married ###. Husband moved out one month ago with no notice or any help with bills. We have a ###.

And it has to just the two of them. ###. Can this be arranged together or two separate issues. 43740.5534722222 Hi ###, I am sorry to hear that you are going through a difficult situation. The answer to your question depends on which court you are going to be in. This is because you will need an attorney who is licensed to practice in that jurisdiction and is familiar with its laws. Then, of course depending on what your question is, we will need to know what the issue is in court in order to give you direction or advise. 43763.74375 I DO HAVE PAPERS 43740.6673611111 ###,Based on your question, it seems that you were married to your ex-husband at the time of your daughter's birth.  If that is true, there is a presumption that he is the father unless that is proven otherwise.  You will need to bring a civil action in the county in which you reside to determine paternity. Because parental rights are constitutional rights, you will need to prove that your ex-husband is not the father and get a court order that says that.  A blood or genetic marker test is likely required to prove that he's not the father.  It's unclear that the test you are using would qualify, but regardless should be able to be done easily. In the civil action, once there has been a determination that your ex-husband is not the father, and an order that shows that, you would need to send the court order to NC Vital Records.  The NC Vital Records website says that no fee will be charged for a paternity change on a birth certificate -- ###.I would recommend that you talk to a family law attorney in your county to determine how your county clerk might handle such an issue.  Other things for you to consider as you contemplate this, is whether your ex-husband is paying child support, and if there is another person who you believe should be replacing him on the birth certificate and would need to pay child support. 43763.9201388889 Hi, I am asking how to remove my ex husbands name from one of my daughters birth certificate. We were married when she was born. We are doing a in home paternity test to show the relation between my ex husband and my daughter. My question is, if it shows he is not her biological father is there a way to remove his name without putting my ###? We both are not agreement of removing his name if he is not her real father. 43740.7375 I apologize, I meant to say that we are both in agreement of removing his name. 43740.7388888889 How can I get more child support when the father of my children has a company with his father and he is the VP of the company but gets paid cash. When I ask for more child support he says that Iâ€™m their mother and I work so I can out the rest and he makes more than I do. How should I go about this? 43740.7423611111 You should probably start with a well worded demand letter to the husband about your request for additional funds based on your child's needs and your husband's means.  If that fails to get the additional funds, then you would likely need to file a motion with the court to modify the existing child support order to increase the payments under the existing order.  Good luck with it. 43764.6125 Contact the cemetery where the grave plots are to inquire what they require to transfer ownership of the plots.  It may not be probate.  The contents of his home usually does not include anything that has a title proving who owns it.  So i cannot imagine anything there needing the documentation of a probate proceeding to transfer ownership. I recommend that you figure out what you are going to do about the house and that trust, and proceed in probate only if you need that for whatever you decide to do about litigating the trust matter. It sounds as if you need good advice from a litigator who handles estate issues to advise you about your prospects in this trust dispute.43741.7986111111 My step father passed away last month and I am the admin or executor of his estate according to his will. Both the will and death certificate have been filed in wake county (where he lived & I still do). He owes ###. I'm guessing the value at ###. Because the value of his estate is low, am I required to file for p###ate?He was ### out of his house (which is in a irrevocable trust) so once he passed, it no longer belonged to his so no income there. The trust was very poorly written and so a judge would have to interpret what it actually says. We hope it's just get thrown out and can be included back in the will but that's for another day.Sincerely, ### ###43740.8965277778 OK, so no need for Probate.

When I called the school last week the principal said it was ok for him to do that because it does not specifically say he can not visit them at school in the order. But that is visitation and I need to know if itâ€™s ok for him to just go to their school whenever he wants to. Until last week he had not seen them since ###. Iâ€™m a single mother and receive assistance so can not afford to pay for an attorney to have order changed. What should I do? 43740.9923611111 You might send an email or letter to the principal indicating that you object to the child being taken out of class as it is interfering with his teaching and learning.

This statute will help to determine if there is a legal cause of action that will allow you to pursue a protective order against your ex and her family.  ###### (https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_50B/GS_###.pdf) will provide the steps to start a civil lawsuit for a domestic violence protection order.

I would, as soon as possible, consult with one of the family law attorneys in or near ### County, and ask what temporary relief from the court you can obtain in order to preserve your access to this vehicle for purposes of earning a living and taking care of your children while the separation and divorce process is pending.  Technically, your husband has an exclusive right to the vehicle because he is the only one listed on the title, but in practice, since you are financially dependent on this vehicle in order to get to and from work, and to take care of the children, you could easily overturn the legal presumption that your husband alone has a right to how the car will be used.  However, you will need a judicial determination in order to make that happen, since, on the face of things, your husband is to be favored since the car is titled solely in his name.A District Court judge will be highly sy###hetic to your need for your usual vehicle given that the well being of minor children are at stake.  When you get to the equitable distribution and property division stage of your divorce, judges try to be equitable in how assets will be divided, and if you are providing a substantial share of the childcare duties, it is quite likely that the judge rule that either your husband re-title the car to you in your name, or will at least protect your right to use it for a time, mostly for the sake of earning a living and taking care of your children.  It will be difficult for you to work this out without a lawyer, so your chances of achieving this are much greater if you can hire counsel.  Hopefully you will find a local lawyer who could work with you on the finances if money is not ### at present.Blessings to you and your family as you work through this transition.  I wish nothing but the best for you and your children.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43746.6993055556 Is it legal in the state of NC for my husband who wants a divorce to take away my vehicle just because its in his name? This is the only transportation I have and I take care of our two kids and have a job.43741.8097222222 Ms. ###,First, you are hitting on all of the right arguments to make to the judge when you appear on the return of the ex parte order.  I believe you will be fine representing yourself, as district court judges are familiar with custody disputes and panicked parents filing these emergency custody complaints.  There should be a hearing to consider whether the ex parte order will continue within ###.  At that hearing, I would bring evidence of the childrenâ€™s doctorâ€™s appointments, school report cards, any documents you have in your possession that your ex husband will not have if he is not involved in these day to day activities with the children.  Your testimony will play well with the judge if you remain calm and keep things very basic to illustrate your intimate knowledge of your childrenâ€™s needs.  Focus on why staying with you is in the childrenâ€™s best interests and avoid focusing on any ### to you personally as a result of the decision.  Having said that, you will need to address the issue that gave rise to the ex parte order.  If there is a stalking conviction, you should bring evidence that the perpetrator has been arrested and perhaps even call the investigating officer to testify at your custody hearing to corroborate that the stalking was not ### by any behavior on your part and that your children are not in danger as a result of being in your custody and care.I hope this is helpful advice, and I wish you the best.43764.6159722222 My ex took out a ex parte emergency custody order and took my kids from me, I was not informed or served with any papers, he claims my children are in an unsafe environment, I was stalked by someone, then on the 2th of September I was attacked outside my home and stabbed and for this reasons he says itâ€™s not safe for my kids. My kids have not been harmed in anyway, i have two sons a ### ###. They do not know about the stalking at all. My oldest son is in therapy, for issues he has with his father. I am the main caretaker for my kids, Iâ€™m the one that takes my kids to doctors appointments, takes them to school, takes them to therapy, does school functions and school meetings. Iâ€™m not sure what steps to take or even what evidence to take to the courts to show that my kids are not in danger or in harms way. That I am the one that makes sure they are happy and healthy and mentally stable. I need some advice on what to do. I canâ€™t afford an attorney so I donâ€™t know what to do 43742.5534722222     My ex and I were never married but had a child together, we split up in ###19. He moved to Michigan and I still live in North Carolina with our son. I would like to establish custody. Am I able to file for myself or do I need to have legal representation since he lives out of state now?Also, with out custody papers, can he come down from Michigan and take him at anytime without my consent? Our son has medicaid and receives WIC through the state of North Carolina.  There is no current agreement, verbal or written, about visitation between the two of us. He also doesn't contact me about our son. He doesn't provide any financial support for our son either.   I just need to know what my options are and I have very little money, so I can't afford any legal representation. Do lawyers offer payment plans or would that depend on the lawyer? 43742.7680555556 You can file a complaint for child custody. You can do it yourself or you can hire an attorney to represent you. Different counties have different types of forms available. I'm not familiar with ### County. In my county, there are no forms at the courthouse. In ### County, there are forms for complaints for child custody. (You can also file for child support, if needed.) Once you get the complaint ready, take it to the courthouse to file in with the civil clerk, along with a civil summons. The civil summons form might be available at the courthouse, or you can get a pdf on the NC courts' website.You can serve him even if he is out of state. He has to be served with the complaint and summons. It must be by personal service - by sheriff's deputy or by certified mail receipt requested at his current address. (It's the ### card.) You will need to schedule a hearing date for custody according to the local rules of your county. He has to have at least ###' notice of a hearing date for custody, and you have to mail him a notice of hearing once he is served.If you had a child together and he is the father on the birth certificate, he can pick up the child if there is no court order or enforceable agreement otherwise. If he is not on the birth certificate, it's harder to say. If you need more information, you can respond and let me know whether he is on the birth certificate. Otherwise, I hope this helped to answer your question.43754.7555555556 Ms. ###:Thanks for asking this worthwhile and important question.  It really is your call; I understand why hiring a probate lawyer is not desirable for an estate so small, but if there are compelling difference of opinion on the two or more sides of this ### proceeding, it is going to be really hard for a non-represented heir or beneficiary to obtain desirable results.  The rules of probate are simply too nuanced and complicated for a non-lawyer to handle very well (although some do pull it off, especially when there are very few heirs and assets, but that is the exception that merely proves the rule).If you do not have the funds for counsel of your own, or do not wish to engage counsel, I recommend your driving over to ### School of Law for a morning and afternoon (park at the Visitors Lot on NC Hwy 54 (### Road), just across from the law school and the School of Government, and when you go into the main entrance, walk downstairs and into the Reading Room of the ### Law Library on the first floor.  At the reference desk, as for the most recent law practice ### on Probate Administration in North Carolina.  You will get to review the reserve materials for about two hours before turning them back in, and you should pay close attention to the chapters and sections about will ###s.  This will not be a substitute for hiring a good probate lawyer, but it will at least arm you with information and law by which to persuade the Clerk to your position on the disputed issues.  The practice guide will reference important provisions of N.C.G.S. Chapter ###, as well as key case precedents from the Supreme Court of North Carolina and NC Court of Appeals interpreting the statutory references at play here.  I wish you the best in this matter, regardless of what you decide.  Best wishes to you this fall.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43744.0034722222 The clerk of court denied a will due to being a copy, a previous Will was submitted. ###. This is a very small estate and we have had ###. Do I really need a attorney?43742.8805555556 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for asking this very important question, and I am deeply sorry that this awful thing happened in your marriage.  What you are asking about are two things: (###) alienation of affection and (###) criminal conversation.  I will explain what you have to show in a North Carolina court in order to prevail on either ### or both of which would be asserted against the boyfriend, not the wife.To win a lawsuit for alienation of affections, you must show (###) that there was a marriage; (###) that there was genuine affection and love between you and your wife; (###) that a third-party, outside the marriage, intentionally, maliciously or recklessly interfered in those marital affections; and (###) that as a result of the third-party interference, the affections of the marriage were destroyed.  (Note that the affections are not considered destroyed" if the marital couple does not divorce or if otherwise they reconcile despite the third-party interference.)  If you have facts to support these four elements you would more likely than not win such a lawsuit against the boyfriend.Criminal conversation is similar except that it is more narrow in scope.  Rather than trying to prove whether affections and love actually existed in your marriage prior to the affair or whether the same was "destroyed you simply have to show that the person had sexual relations with your wife during the marriage, right up to the moment of separation; once separation has occurred, any sexual acts between the separated spouse and other persons cannot be sued upon for criminal conversation.  You are allowed to use circumstantial evidence to support your claim that criminal conversation ###, but not limited to, texts, phone logs, ###, private investigator reports, or testimony of witnesses privy to the knowledge.  If you are interested in pursing this, you will need to speak with either a general civil litigation lawyer or a family lawyer about filing suit.  Keep in mind that depending on what financial situation the boyfriend has, you may or may not find this worth your while, since the person would be judgment proof" if he has no assets or money out of which to pay a court judgment even if you win in court.  These and other practical considerations such as the cost of legal fees and discovery are among the preliminary considerations you should discuss with legal counsel during an initial consultation.  The statute of limitations for both offenses is three years by the way.I hope this is helpful and informative for your purposes.  I do sincerely wish you a fall of healing contemplation and renewal as I know that betrayal of this sort is deeply hurtful.  I wish you every good thing possible for your heartbreak and trouble.Be well### A. ### ### Esq."43745.8673611111 I want to sue my wife for adultery and abandonment43745.58125 ### county custody caseMy ###father has legal custody We were ordered to email communications but his emails are verbally and emotionally abusive.

If finances are the issue, I would try a couple of different things.  First, see if you can find someone local who is willing to take the case pro bono" -- which means they will represent you for free or at a reduced rate.

"43764.6180555556 Ms. ###:Thank you for this very important question.  I am very sorry this happened, and am glad that your daughter is safe.  Essentially, I see only two options at present: either (###) work something out with your husband without going to court, or (###) petitioning the ### County District Court for partial or full custody, depending on the circumstances.  You can produce evidence at the custody trial by which the judge can determine custody and visitation issues.  While this can be done sometimes without legal counsel, I strongly recommend hiring a family law attorney in ### County if you can at all manage it.  Some attorneys will offer payment plans if that is needed.  Without legal counsel in a judicial custody proceeding, it will be difficult to regain control over this situation, for the maximum benefit of your daughter.I pray a good and beneficial result for you and your daughter as you go forward this fall.  God bless you and your family.Be well,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43747.2270833333 My husband and I divorced over a year ago. We did not put custody in our papers and there is no custody agreement. Our oldest daughter ran away from her fathers home today and luckily ended up at my families house. She repeatedly stated she feared for her safety at his home and pleaded not to go back there. What can I do with there being no custody agreement? 43747.1736111111 Again, until their is a court order that specifies that you have custody of the children, and that they live with you, and that they go to school based on your address, then his rights and yours are the same.  He can register them for school; you can register them from school.  He can take them to live in his home (even if that home is with a person he's not married to);  you can have them live in your home.  If he has felony charges pending, and he is trying to get disability on the children, then it's not likely to help his custody case.  If DSS says that he is not to have contact of them, then be sure to show that to the school (because they need documents to prove that they should not be releasing the children to him).  If you have concerns that the children are at substantial risk of bodily harm when they are in his custody, you may be able to file for emergency custody or for a domestic violence protective order (restraining order).  But if that's not the case, and you are just disagreeing about which parent they primarily live with and where they go to school, you need an court order for custody to address those issues.  Once you get that order, you give it to ### ###. to keep the children in the school you've put them in.  43747.7722222222 Can I do anything legally considering he has several court dates In several counties for serious felonies and is trying to use the children for disability and to ### the courts for leniency.  Also if we have equal rights how can he take our kids for his benefit to live at his ex wife's house isn't living with her considered adult?  Thank you so much@43747.7625 Until there is a court order that specifies legal and physical custody, neither parent has more rights than the other.  Absent an order that says otherwise, you can legally go to their school and pick them up.  However, you may consider that it's not in the children's best interest to bounce back and forth between ###. DSS cannot tell you what to do for custody.  DSS can make recommendations to parents - as far as how parents are to behave, what treatment the family needs, etc - while the DSS case is open.  But unless DSS takes custody of the children (which it must do through a court process), DSS cannot give you a custody order as between you and your spouse.43747.5881944444 my husband and I are separated and live in separate towns.  He recently came and checked the kids out of school without my knowledge and took them later to enroll them in his town.  He will not let me see them or bring them back.  Can he do this.  What can I do?  Can I legally go and pick them up?  We are both wrapping up an investigation by DSS can they help?43747.2916666667 Be very careful to know the rights of the estate and the heirs.  It is the job of the finance company to ### as much money from you as they can scare you into paying.  The estate can only pay as much as it has and the heirs do not receive an obligation to pay off debts that exceed the value of what the decedent owned.  There are two issues here:###.  Is the $###,###.  If the car was recently purchased, it is quite possible that more was owed than the actual value.  More likely is that they sold the car at auction for cheap and now want to collect the rest of the full amount dues.  Perhaps if you had sold it yourself, you would have sold it for more than they did.  Plus, they are charging you a great fee for ### it and selling it.  So, look carefully at all those numbers and make sure they are legitimate.  If so, the amount due may be correct.###.  What can the bank seize or claim to pay the debt.  Do Not agree to make payments.  You will get swept up into assuming a personal liability for the debt you do not owe. Consider carefully the debts of the decedent - their fair total.  Consider what was in the estate and what else could they require you to bring in to pay debts. If there are more debts (that you consider legitimate) than there are assets, you have to pay a pro rata share of each debt and tell the creditors that is all they get. Remember the court costs, part of the funeral and other costs of administration take priority.  So you may need to write to various creditors saying, this is all we have and you only get a share.  Or if you consider some debt (see ###) to be unfair or improper, because it is not proven to be his debt or it is not calculated properly, then you can write to them and say as Executor, I am denying your claim for the following reason:..... Then give them ###.You can see this can be a little complicated.  It might be worth paying for an attorney to look through all this to advise you about your specifics if there is enough money involved to be worth it.  You can call me, 9###9-###, ### ###.43747.7847222222 If the estate is closed, they have no recourse.  Ignore them.43748.5833333333 My father died in January. He had taken out a car loan that still had @ $12,###. There was no life insurance on the loan. I was the executor and recently closed with probate. We surrendered the car back to the bank, which auctioned it. They are claiming a discrepancy between what they got at auction and what was owed of @ $###. What are the legal obligations of the estate and/or heirs in this situation? The bank wants me to sign a new contract setting up payments on the remaining balance but I'm hesitant to sign without being fully aware of what's legally required.43747.7652777778 Thank you for the response. Are any of the concerns in issue ###, since all of the paperwork has been filed with Probate court and the state has declared the estate closed? He had no assets, and no other outstanding debts. Can a creditor still pursue collection action after the estate is closed? I'd assumed once it was closed I was no longer considered an executor. But as his heir am I liable for an outstanding debt after the estate is closed?43747.8298611111 Thank you. I appreciate it.43748.7770833333  If the childâ€™s father wishes to seek a joint custody arrangement, he will need to file a complaint with the court to start a custody case. Until then, if you have not already gone to court or mediation to obtain a custody order, there is no custody order in place, which means that he will have a right to visit with the child and it will be harder to enforce exact timing schedules or other details of an agreement.  The complaint can be filed in the county where any of the parties (mother, father, child) reside.If an existing custody order has already been put in place by the court, he will technically be filing a motion (request) to modify the order. The father is required to serve the mother with notice (in other words, deliver a copy of the complaint) either through the sheriff or by certified mail. The mother than has ###. If you already have a custody order in place, the details of that order will remain in effect until they are modified by a judge.If you are interested in a joint custody arrangement or do not want to wait on the father to file with the court for other reasons, you can also file a complaint with the court yourself to start a custody case.Generally, before a custody case goes before a judge, the court will refer it to the Custody Mediator Program. The parents meet with a trained, impartial mediator who tries to help them resolve the case outside of court. Attorneys do not attend mediation, but it may be wise to consult one first regarding your legal rights and obligations as a parent. A major advantage of mediation is that it is provided for free and ### the time and costs of going to court. If parties cannot agree on a resolution in mediation, then one of the parties would have to request a hearing before a judge. If mediation is successful, it will result in a temporary custody agreement that both parties sign. Both you and the father would use that custody agreement for a set period of time, often six months, to see how it works out for you. If there are significant challenges with the order, then you can resolve those prior to the entry of a permanent order at the end of the defined time period. These custody agreements can outline many details, including a general visitation schedule, who has the right to make decisions related to religion, school, ###, or other issues that are important to you, what schedule parents may use for communicating with the child when the child is not with them, what other adults can be allowed near the child, and even how holidays will be shared. If there are things that are particularly important to you to include, you can start thinking of those things now and have a list ready for the mediation.In making a custody determination, the court will consider first and foremost what is in the best interests of the child. This depends heavily on the unique facts of the situation and there are few hard and fast rules. If a child is of sufficient age to decide for himself or herself the parent with whom he or she would prefer to live, this preference will factor heavily in the courtâ€™s decision, but it is not conclusive. Some other things the court or mediator may consider include but are not limited to: (###) a proposed workable schedule and what type of schedule would be least disruptive to the child; (###) whether the parent has the time, room and ability to care for the child; (3)whether the parent has been substantially involved with the childâ€™s upbringing and have previously helped care for and make decisions concerning the child; (###) whether the parents have been cooperative and ### as to the child and what ways the parents are able to continue to ### together; and (5) any history of domestic violence or other abuse in the home. A natural (biological) parent has a constitutional right to custody of his child, but he may lose that right if the court determines that he is unfit or has behaved in a way that is inconsistent with that right. The court must make this determination based on â€œclear and convincing evidence,â€ meaning the mother opposing the fatherâ€™s custody can present evidence that father should not have custody. While, again, there are no set rules, some examples of unfitness that courts have found in the past include substance abuse problems, lack of respect for authority, an inability to recognize the childâ€™s developmental problems, or being unable to provide for the childâ€™s welfare. A father who abandons a child after birth or has minimal contact during the childâ€™s formative years may be found to have behaved inconsistently with his parental right, and this can serve as grounds for the court denying custody. His custody rights do not depend on the payment of child support, but a refusal to pay child support may impact the courtâ€™s analysis of a parentâ€™s ability to act in the childâ€™s best interests. Additional information can be found on the website for the North Carolina Judicial Branch: ###. Resources, including online custody paperwork filings, can be found here: ###. Finally, Legal Aid of North Carolina provides additional resources and ### informational clinics. These clinics do not provide legal representation but can answer general questions and point clients to available resources.http://www.legalaidnc.org/get-help/self-help-clinics/child-custody-and-visitation.43763.5965277778 I recently put my ### father on child support after ###. He has since quit his job so the temporary order is $###.  He lives with his mother and always has. He doesn't have any bills, but now he is requesting joint custody of our child. What is my recourse?43748.5875 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  You ask good questions here.  First, keep in mind that in order to sue for alienation of affections, you have to show the following: (###) that a marriage existed; (###) that genuine love and affection existed in the marriage (even if not perfect); (###) that a third party intentionally, maliciously or recklessly interfered in the marital relationship (by sexual affair or other ###s); and (###) that by such interference, the third party destroyed" the affections of the marriage.  One of the principal ways you prove Element (###) is that a divorce occurred or at least a separation resulting from the third-party interference.  So if you are not separated there is a strong possibility that the affections will be reconciled and therefore they are not really "destroyed" in any legal sense whatever pain and hurt might exist on a personal level (and understandably so).  The defendant in this case would be the interfering third party and not the spouse who was involved with the third party.  The lawsuit can include all wrongful acts up to the date of separation; due to a ### wrongful actions taking place after the spouses have separated are not actionable for civil liability purposes.However you do not have to be separated to sue for criminal conversation; you simply need to prove that during your marriage someone outside that marriage had sexual relations with your spouse.  Again the defendant would be the wrongful party outside the marriage and not the participating spouse.Both criminal conversation and alienation of affections have a three-year statute of limitations the clock of which begins to run from the date of the defendant's last wrongful act.As to your question about fee structure this depends entirely on the lawyer you retain for your lawsuit.  The practical answer is that most lawyers will not do this on a contingency basis since so many individual defendants are "judgment proof" after claiming a generous helping of statutory exemptions from judgment which normally protect a large share of equity in a primary residence as well as one's primary vehicle and personal household effects.  So unless the defendant is a financially ### one you might get a judgment that destroys the defendant's credit for a decade but you may or may not actually collect any money even if you win.  For a lawyer to risk not ever getting paid for thirty (###0) to fifty (50) hours of work (or more) could be financially disastrous for the vast majority of us.  Some might agree to a hybrid arrangement where you pay a certain sum up front but I doubt many high-quality lawyers will do this for you on a pure contingency basis unless the defendant is a wealthy individual.I hope this information is helpful to you in your vetting and planning stages.  You should seek out either a family law attorney or a general civil litigator should you decide to pursue this further.  God bless you this fall.### A. ### ### Esq. "43748.6993055556 hi I was wondering do you hAVE to be legally separated in order to file for these type of cases and is there any lawyers out there who will work on these type of cases on a contingency basis thank you 43748.6069444444 I would like to request judicial assistance in taking special family vacation to Disney. This is a one-time trip that has been in planning for ###. The mother of my step-daughter, holding current primary custody with final decision making, had decided that she does not want Winter, the minor child, to accompany us: her father, step-sister, half brother and myself, on the trip. She verbally agreed over the past ###, stating that she did not want Winter missing ###. The days are eligible to be excused as a Family Education Trip, not to mention Winter is in kindergarten and would easily make up any missed work. I was told that we could file a Motion for Judicial Assistance. My husband went to the courthouse and requested the form to file this motion and was told that they were unaware of such a form. He asked if they could provide him with the correct form to seek assistance in this matter and was told they could not provide legal advice. Are you able to advise what form we would file to ask for this specific situation to be heard before the court?  Thank you. 43748.8618055556 If the mother has primary legal and physical custody, then filing a motion to modify the custody order is your best option. You can state in the motion or request a temporary custody hearing and explain that you need a temporary modification allowing such a trip without the mother's specific permission.43754.8041666667 Perfect, thank you.43754.8097222222 Please provide information on the current status of the custody arrangement. Are you the step-mother? What is the father's name? Is there a court order for custody or is there a parenting or separation agreement in place? If there is no court order for custody and no separation agreement with custody provisions, that changes the answer. If there is a custody order in place and you cannot take the child without the mother's consent according to the custody order, it's possible you would need to file a motion to modify the child custody order. If there is a custody order in place and it allows you to take her, but the mother is violating the court order, then it's possible you would need to file a motion for contempt for violation of an order. If you can give me a little more information, I can help answer your question. I'm not familiar with a motion for judicial assistance being used for such a case. I also know that the ### County courthouse has very few forms related to child custody. ### County has a self help center with more forms available.

We very carefully researched the best time to visit the Florida park taking into account the cost crowd volume and weather.

You will need to serve at least once a week for three consecutive weeks, pursuant to Rule ###.  BEFORE you attempt this, however, please read Rule 4, Sections (j1) and (j2) very carefully, since it contains several details you should heed in order to get this right.  See the rule at this link: ###.Be extra certain that you cannot serve by any other ###s (such as personal delivery, sheriff's service or through a process server), since judges prefer that service by publication be done only as a last resort.  So if you know where the defendant lives or works, see if there is a way you can personally serve the defendant either by hand delivery or by service through the Sheriff or process server (follow Rule 4(j) generally on how to do each of these).  If you serve personally through hand delivery, you will need to type up and have notarized an Affidavit of Service to file with the Court, specifying the details of the who, what, when and how of service of process, down to the minor details (date, day, time, place, etc.).Hope this helps somewhat.

I pray things work out for you as well! God bless you and have a great day!Thank you!43749.3076388889 We have filed for divorce and gone through the whole process. We sent the papers certified mail but the ex is not cooperating. We can do divorce by publication but we need to know where and how long to run the advertisement.

As I understand things, your question relates to how to deal with a DSS employee that is acting inappropriately.  My recommendation would be to create a timeline of what has happened with Ms. ### and all of the things she has said or done that you feel are inappropriate.  You can then contact ### County DSS by phone (or look them up on the Internet) and ask for her superior or manager.  That is the person who would be able to deal with an inappropriate employee.  If you have tried this, or it has been unsuccessful, I would urge you to contact a local attorney.  The North Carolina Bar Association also has an attorney referral program that may be able to assist.  If the issue is getting back parental rights, you definitely will need an attorney.43764.5930555556 Mr. ###,I am sorry you are experiencing these difficulties with gaining access to your children. If you have a written custody agreement, then have you considered filing a Motion to Show Cause or Motion for Contempt (asking the court to hold mom accountable for NOT complying with the agreement)? The judge will decide the appropriate penalty for the violation. As this appears to be a pattern of behavior, you may want to provide details to a family law attorney who can ask you the necessary back and forth questions to obtain a clear picture about your history and the current pattern of noncompliance. I encourage you to consider contacting the NC Lawyer Referral Service. Here, you can request to have a consultation with a family law attorney in your area. These attorneys have agreed to speak with the community and provide a ### $50. This is substantially less than a typical consultation fee. By going through the program, you are NOT committed to working with that attorney beyond the consultation period, but if you decide to do so, then the both of you will discuss additional fees for future assistance. If you go this route, please make notes of your specific questions and have a copy of your custody agreement for the attorney to review. The NC Lawyer Referral Services can be reached at 800-###. Here is the website: https://www.ncbar.org/public-resources/lawyer-referral-service/I hope this helps and wish you the best of luck!43762.6361111111 My custody ### it states I get the boys on my days off which are every Friday and Saturday.

I am frustrated and lost on options43749.8027777778 Absolutely.  Glad to help offer some information and context.  Take things one day at a time.  You will get through this stronger and better than before.43750.0104166667 Good Friday evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for this important question, and I am sorry for what has lately transpired in your marriage and home life.  In the event that you and your husband do not reconcile, and your husband is not willing to cooperate with you in negotiating a Separation and Property Settlement Agreement, both abandonment of family and committing adultery are grounds for divorce from bed and board under N.C.G.S. Â§ ### (in addition to cruel treatment, abuse or serious substance abuse, which I a###suming are not applicable here since any mention of such is omitted from your fact su###y).  This would be the court's judicial termination of the fact and date of your effective legal separation in contemplation of a divorce, and also the terms of that interim period.Alimony is governed by a different ### Â§ ### is triggered by the following elements enumerated in the statutory provision:As used in this Chapter, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the following definitions apply:(1)       Alimony" ###s an order for payment for the support and maintenance of a spouse or former spouse periodically or in a lump sum for a specified or for an indefinite term ordered in an action for divorce whether absolute or from bed and board or in an action for alimony without divorce.(2)       "Dependent spouse" ###s a spouse whether husband or wife who is actually substantially dependent upon the other spouse for his or her maintenance and support or is substantially in need of maintenance and support from the other spouse.(3)       "Marital misconduct" ###s any of the following acts that occur during the marriage and prior to or on the date of separation:a.         Illicit sexual behavior. For the purpose of this section illicit sexual behavior ###s acts of sexual or deviate sexual intercourse deviate sexual acts or sexual acts defined in G.S. 14-27.20(4) voluntarily engaged in by a spouse with someone other than the other spouse;b.         Involuntary separation of the spouses in consequence of a criminal act committed prior to the proceeding in which alimony is sought;c.         Abandonment of the other spouse;d.         Malicious turning out-of-doors of the other spouse;e.         Cruel or barbarous treatment endangering the life of the other spouse;f.          Indignities rendering the condition of the other spouse intolerable and life burdensome;g.         Reckless spending of the income of either party or the destruction waste diversion or concealment of assets;h.         Excessive use of alcohol or drugs so as to render the condition of the other spouse intolerable and life burdensome;i.          Willful failure to provide necessary subsistence according to one's ###s and condition so as to render the condition of the other spouse intolerable and life burdensome.Based on what you wrote in your fact su###y it sounds like you would qualify for alimony payments under Subsection (3)(a) and (c) at bare minimum and maybe other subsections depending on what you can prove about your husband's conduct.As to child custody that will depend largely on the judge's determination of what is in "the best interests of the child."  Your husband could consent to a decree in which you are granted sole custody; otherwise the judge will learn towards allowing both parents to have some degree of custody (not necessarily 50-50) since most judges believe that a child having a part in both parents' lives is essential to that child's well being.  However that legal presumption can be challenged and there are instances in which single parents are granted sole custody.  It is hard to say for certain how the custody battle will play out until actual evidence is heard by a judge in the case.You will need to retain a local family law attorney if at all ### if your husband is either uncooperative willing to hire counsel of his own or a combination of both.  See what family law attorneys practice in Nash and surrounding counties and hopefully you can find someone who will work with you to safeguard your and your son's interest on a payment arrangement that you can afford.  I wish you and your son a positive turn and outcome in this matter.  God bless you both.Brandon A. Robinson ### Esq."43749.9284722222 I really appreciate those words of encouragement. By the way, do you know about how much an attorney charge to represent a case like mine in NC?43750.0465277778 My husband has abandoned my son and I after ###. He left me with all of our bills in delinquent status. I know my husband has cheated and is still seeing other women. Am I entitled to spousal support or alimony as well as sole custody for my son and child support?43749.8145833333 Thanks so much 43750.0048611111 That is a really good question.  In your case, you can probably find several really good family law attorneys in small ### like ### County who would charge far less than the upfront $5,###.  I cannot remember whether contingency fees are permitted in alimony lawsuits (I used to know this for the bar exam, but have since forgotten it), but that would be a question to ask your attorney during an initial consultation.  My guess is that a family law attorney in your area, with three to five years' experience, would charge an hourly rate of anywhere between $### $###.  Some might do a flat fee rate of $5,### $10,000, either lump sum or payable in three or four installments.  There is room to be creative here, assuming the attorney is willing and able.  These cases can get lengthy and complicated quickly, so an attorney has to be prepared to invest up to ###.  Good question to ask.43750.0861111111 Hello, Ms. ###:I appreciate your question.  I would offer two suggestions: first, visit your Onslow County Clerk of Superior Court and ask if they offer a self-help packet of family court materials for pro se litigants (some NC courthouses do, like mine in ### County, but not all courthouses do the same).  Additionally, please contact the North Carolina Central University Family Law Clinic in ###.  I think they still offer packets for child custody and divorce for around $20 (price may have changed, but it is relatively cheap).  They might also provide you with advice on a limited basis, so I would ask them how far they can assist you.  See the link here:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/file-it-yourself/Once you get started, you may wish to occasionally put in a couple hours' study on a quiet Saturday or Sunday at a public library where you can access ### North Carolina Family Law, considered the best treatise in North Carolina on the subject, and also civil practice manuals in family law.  This will augment whatever information you obtain from the courthouse and/or ### Family Law Clinic.  Lastly, you can always inquire of the family law clinics at ### Law School in ###, ### Law School in Greensboro, and Wake Forest Law School in ###, to see what free materials they might provide you.Upward and onward!  Best wishes to you in this pursuit.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43750.1145833333 I am a stay at home mom with ### ###. My husband has been out of the home for well over a year. He pays all the bills in the home but currently living some where else. We have several pieces of property and businesses together. I need to know what my options are in filing for divorce if I decide to do so. What could be the possible outcome for me and my children?43749.9805555556 Thank you for your kind words and advice. God bless you and I will take all that by have ### to me and go from there..43750.8395833333 Thank you for your response. My husband and I have been together for ### 10. Right now I'm in a financial bind. All money that is made through our businesses and rental properties are put in an account that is solely put in his name. I don't have access to the money unless I go through him. He has made it clear to me that I can't spend any money that I don't help him make. I have several children to feed and take care of. What can I do as far as child support for my kids? 43750.36875 Very good.  Will say a ### for you today.43750.8409722222 You would need a hearing in court on that one.  This one of the questions you can ask the law clinic folks (at whatever law schools I mentioned that you might contact).  This will likely involve your filing a lawsuit, and you might be able to have your court filing fees waived (check with the courthouse folks on this one too, since I am not sure what Onslow County's policies are).  I am very sympathetic to your financial strains; my mother had similar struggles when I was growing up, when she raised me and my sibling as a single parent.  You have my prayers and my sincere moral support.43750.7965277778 If a father only does morning drop off for school, evening pick up from school and the child likes to go for a few hours on The Weekend. Is that considered as the father having the child majority of the time if the mother was working during that time during the weekday. Weekends I am off . We agreed to the transporting before the school year started . However,  He wants to be free of doing them both, is it just best to do full custody . Iâ€™m afraid he may one day stop picking up due to how he may feel currently Or past emotions regarding me and using it against our son. He is trying to now tell me itâ€™s best if his mother takes our son and Live in Florida . He is trying to make all the decisions on my behalf . I want my son with me fully. 43751.6159722222 Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  You have good reason to be concerned if there is no present consent decree or court order determining custody and visitation, and indeed without these in play, some of the ### you fear could happen.  Most of the questions you ask here will require judicial determination based on the facts that the judge hears (with supporting evidence, including testimony by the ###), so your likely next step is to initiate a custody trial in Wake County District Court.  Ideally, you would hire a family law attorney to represent you, since that will more likely lead to your obtaining a desirable result than if you proceed pro se, but if you cannot presently afford counsel and wish to proceed nonetheless, you can ask the Family Law Court of the Wake County District Court Division whether they offer self-help packets that would assist in your filing for custody (see ### for courthouse information).  Also consider reaching out to the ### Family Law Clinic in ###.  They might be able to provide you with free legal advice, and they typically offer a ### packet for custody and other family law matters for a low fee ($20.###, although you can confirm price with the law clinic folks).  See the below link for ###:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/###/Hope this helps you get started.  I wish you and your child the very best in this very serious, important matter.Blessings this fall,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43751.8159722222 I am sorry we did not get to this in time for your hearing.  Hopefully the hearing went well.  if not, you may have certain appeal rights.  If so, feel free to submit another question to the queue.  Good luck with it! 43764.6104166667 I filed for child support in N.C.  all other family court issues were resolved in N.C. wake county courthouse.

Makes very good money, I'm on disability. He is verbally and financially abusive and becoming ### to burn my things if I don't get them out of the bedroom. I can't afford a lawyer because i have had to use my income to take care of house hold needs. he canceled his bank card so I have no money and is threatening to cancel my phone. I know I can get child support and alimony but can not afford a lawyer.he has been removed from them in the past because of drugs by social services and we have lost a house. I just want him out and to pay his ### what he has done. Are there lawyers that will help me and make him pay?43753.0354166667 There are free legal clinics available in North Carolina, including but not limited to, NC Legal Aid and law school clinics (perhaps ### law and ### Law) that can help you with your case.  I certainly recommend an attorney to help you with your matter especially since you will want alimony and child support, and to make sure you secure both in your divorce.  I recommend you contact one of the free legal services as soon as possible.  It sounds like he is the supporting spouse financially so you will want to ensure that you get payments from him moving forward to help you financially.43764.6048611111 Good afternoon, ###:Thank you for your question.  Separation for purposes of obtaining a divorce under the one-year rule of N.C.G.S. Â§ 50-###: (###) physical separation by maintaining two distinct, separate residences, and (###) cessation of any regular pattern of marital relations.  If these two elements are true and maintained for at least a year, with at least one of the spouses living in North Carolina for six months prior to suing for divorce in this state, the law presumes that the party seeking the divorce can do so based on one year's separation.The fact that the husband was verbally abuse does not speed up the time to get the divorce; what that would speak to is the option of obtaining a divorce from bed and board which is a judicial determination of the terms of separation, or the option of seeking alimony.  Both options require a showing of marital misconduct, which is broadly defined but can include, among other things, abuse, ### adultery, serious ### abuse, abandonment, or domestic violence.  Divorce from bed and board is governed by N.C.G.S. Â§ ###, which can be read at this link: https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_50/GS_###.pdfAlimony, governed by N.C.G.S. Â§ 50-###6.3A, can be further examined at this link: https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_50/GS_50-###6.3A.pdfYou will need to hire a family law attorney to help you wade through these complicated aspects should you wish to pursue them in court.  However, as long as you no longer live together and have ceased regular marital relations (sporadic instances of marital relations without resumption of living together are not considered reconciliation, and will not count against you for purposes of triggering the one year before eligibility for divorce), you have already begun a legal separation.  You can also negotiate a written Separation and Property Division Agreement if you two are in agreement on the broad terms of your separation and eventual divorce, but you should not attempt such a private agreement without the assistance of legal counsel.  That is an option, however, as you wait for the one year to pass.Best wishes to you this fall,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43754.7805555556 Good afternoon,what are the proper steps to become legally separated and divorced? My husband and I agreed to separate in ### ###19. I thought our leases will be ok when I goto file for divorce stating we have been separated. I was told this was not correct. My husband was verbally abusive as well would this allow me immediate divorce or would I still need to wait the whole year of separation?43754.7458333333 I forgot to mention that a great law student from ### School of Law performed all of the research in this question and drafted the response.  I reviewed her draft and I ### with her analysis. 43763.7291666667 I was divorced in ###.  I lost a vehicle to my ex in the settlement. The vehicle had been in my name and the bank loan for the vehicle was in both of our names.  A few years later, she had the vehicle repossessed from non-payments.  The bank forgave over $###, which was the outstanding balance. Earlier this year, I got a letter from the IRS saying that the forgiven balance is taxable and I owed over $### 2017.  I appealed this based on ### of the vehicle and got a response back a while ago, saying that the ruling stands unless I can get a letter from the bank stating that the money was mistakenly assigned to me as income.  The bank doesn't have any record that I was ever divorced.My question is: Am I responsible for property lost in a divorce settlement nearly ###?I mistakenly assumed the outcome of my appeal and now I am one day past the date when I can dispute this with a letter from the bank.  A letter which I will never get from them.Also, can I fight this legally and what is the reasonable range in fees, should I hire a lawyer to handle my case?43755.6986111111 It was not the answer I was hoping for but I appreciate your effort and I respect your effort and knowledge.  Thank you.43768.5215277778 Please be aware that I do not practice law in ### and I cannot opine upon ### law.  Also, this response is only my legal opinion.  Another attorney may have a different opinion.  Quick answer is yes, I believe that you are still responsible for the loan even if a court granted the vehicle to your spouse in a divorce settlement. Analysis             Both North Carolina and New ### apply the principle of equitable distribution when it comes to marital property, including marital debt. [###] [###] The car loan would be considered marital debt because both spouses signed an agreement for the car loan. While it is therefore true that the court has the power to grant the car as property to one spouse as well as assign the payment of the debt, creditors are not bound by the division of debt or indebted property and may seek repayment from either party subject to the debt. [###]  Since the creditor could have still come after you for repayment of the debt, the forgiveness of the loan is technically income to you and is therefore subject to the income tax. [###] N.C. ###. Stat. Â§ 50-###0[###] ### Stat. Â§ ###A:###4-######.###[###] Branch Banking and Trust Co. v. ###, ###.C.

We are planning on living separately but I dont start working with the state until January and will not have any money coming in until Feburary (when I get my first check). I am drawing up a separation agreement and would like someone to read it if they are able to.43755.8194444444 The requirements to pay certain amounts are generally mandated in the Separation Agreement.  So, you need to be very specific as to the payment obligations of the payor in the Agreement.  Just make sure you have an obligation in the Agreement to pay you through February a sufficient amount until your new job starts.  This would go in Subsection D of your Agreement.  Good luck with it.43764.6090277778 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for this important question.  The separation agreement was no longer valid when reconciliation occurred, UNLESS there was a provision in the separation agreement that specifically states that the terms of the separation (and property division, if applicable) are to be in full effect if reconciliation ends, until/unless the parties mutually agree to amendments or subsequent agreements that supersede the old one.  In almost every instance, once reconciliation occurs (###ing the couple has resumed living together, and has resumed regular marital relations), the legal effect of the separation ends, and if separation ### after an interim period of reconciliation, a new separation agreement would need to be signed and notarized, with the dates and terms changed to meet the new realities as agreed upon by the spouses.  Whatever issues cannot be worked out in the separation agreement (such as division of property, and whether the parties will file jointly or separately), can be worked out through the equitable distribution process in the divorce proceedings.I have not done many divorces in my career, but when I did, I worked out a compromise in my separation agreement by which the parties would agree, despite their intended divorce, that they will still file jointly on their income taxes during the one-year separation, if their ### advisor advised that doing so would be to both spouses' benefit; otherwise, from that point on, the ### would operate their finances separately and independently.  Best thing here is for both spouses to independently hire family law counsel, who can both review the prior separation agreement and contact one another to negotiate a new one for this latest separation period of at least one year, in contemplation of a divorce.  It is far better that the spouses work this out in a separation agreement that they consent to, rather than having a judge decide for them should this come to a fight over equitable distribution or alimony, before the decree of absolute divorce is entered by the District Court judge.  The more issues the spouses can preempt by private separation agreement, the more control they will have in the outcome of their divorce.Definitely working closely with family law counsel is needed in order to get the best outcome in this.Have a blessed weekend and autumn in ### County.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43757.6923611111 Legal separation and then reconciled ### ###.

She is self employed and he had suggested they use his refund to offset her self employment taxes. She is stuck paying all of taxes and he got refund.

I want to know how I can get power of attorney for him in NC. My grandfather's step daughter in law has power of attorney because my grandfather has alzheimer's and dementia and his wife recently passed away. My grandfather did not want to be in ### with them anymore so he went to do a trial with my Aunt in ###. They sent him on the airplane with just a carry on which he lost and $###. My aunt has reported that his alzheimer's is progressing rapidly. She called the daughter in law to find out about his medications because he came with none. They have sent a text telling my aunt to take him to the ER, have him evaluated and sedated because of his behavior. She also said she would call and tell him because of his behavior he is going to the doctor or to jail or that my aunts sons would come and kill him. She said getting him medicated would resolve his behavior. My aunt told them she can not continue to take care of him and the $### $###. My aunt can not continue to take care of him. She says he is up all hours, he gets lost in her house , he even tried to go out the back door in the middle of the night. We want to get him placed in to a memory care facility but we can not do that with her having power of attorney. My aunt has talked to my grandfather's Step daughter in law in regards to him coming to NC but she has refused. She says she will keep him as long as she can and then put him in a nursing home in ###. We feel like they are only trying to keep him for his social security check. My Aunt has written a letter stating all the facts and that she feels he should be in NC because his biological family. He has grandchildren and great grandchildren here and we want to be a part of his life and see that he is cared for.43759.1020833333 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your very important question.  This is a serious matter indeed.  Since your grandfather's Alzheimer's case is rapidly progressing, it is all but unlikely that he has mental capacity to sign a new power of attorney instrument revoking the prior one, so your being appointed as your grandfather's agent is not a ### course based on what you have written here.  However, if you have serious and adequate grounds to assert and prove in court that your aunt or the daughter-in-law with the POA is unfit to care for your grandfather in light of his illness, it is possible that you could successfully obtain court-appointed guardianship over your grandfather's person and finances.  This would require a court action in the state where your grandfather is living, so you would likely need to call an elder law attorney who practices in the ### county where your grandfather presently resides.  The first thing that you and local counsel will need to discuss are the jurisdictional issues between ### and North Carolina, and then secondly, to what extent ### law would allow you to override the POA through a guardianship lawsuit.  I practice law only in North Carolina, so you would need to speak with ### elder law counsel on these preliminary issues.  (### Find a Lawyer" feature can help you ### search for attorneys based on geographical location and legal practice area.  If you go to that website and search search under the practice headings of "Elder Law" and "Guardianship.")Once you have had your initial consultation with counsel in ### you will have a better roadmap as to how to tackle this situation long ###.  If you have any reason to believe that your grandfather is being defrauded or abused also raise the issue of a referral to Adult Protective Services in ### to have it investigated.Blessings to you and your family as you work through these challenges.  I hope you obtain the better clarity you need very soon.  Have a productive fall.### A. ### ### Esq."43759.1152777778 Good afternoon, Mrs. ###:These are very good questions, and you have reasons to be concerned about the things you related.  I believe it is very much in both your and your husband's best interests (and of course, that of the children) for you and your husband to execute a comprehensive Separation and Property Settlement Agreement, which would reduce all your presently tentative understandings to a legally binding writing.  You should hire family law counsel to help you draft the agreement, and then the two sides should sign in the presence of a notary public, judge, magistrate, or courthouse clerk.  Otherwise, yes, I can imagine that the promises exchanged up to this point will not be honored once added stress ### during the one-year separation.Since you both have financial challenges, the separation agreement would be the more affordable and efficient route to resolving most of your issues incidental to the actual divorce, since otherwise, the parties will have to litigate these matters, which will take up a lot of a lawyer's billable hours, and would be quite expensive if the sides decide to fight over everything.  With a lawyer advising you, you both should try to resolve as many issues in advance as possible, so that once the one-year separation has run, getting the actual divorce will be much simpler, and involve fewer steps.That is how I would approach this situation.  Consider reaching out to my friends ### ### and ### ### of the law firm of ### and ###, of Chapel Hill.  I ### the link to their law firm site here: https://###and###.co###torneys.shtml .  Let either or both of them know that I recommended you to them.I hope everything works out in the best of ways to all persons in your family affected by this transition.  God bless you all this fall and winter.Best wishes,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43759.7930555556 Hi, my husband and I are separating, but are still living together, and because we live on his family land, I have to move out.  We are trying to make this transition as amicable as possible, but I'm worried that if I leave, he will try to say that I've abandoned the kids or something crazy like that.  The home is in both our names and he wants me to sign it over to him.  I've asked him for half of the equity and he said that he would do that, but I know that he will have a hard time refinancing on his income alone, so I may not get any money and I'm worried that he'll get nasty and say that because I left, I don't get anything.  My worries stem from him being short tempered and angry and not keeping his word in the past.  What can I do to protect myself and my kids financially?  We are going to split the kids' time 50/50, so that he does not have to pay child support.  I also found out recently that he is on a dating site already.  I am shocked and surprised that he would do that, but on the other hand, he has called all the shots in our relationship and once he said that our marriage was over, I guess in his mind, it was over right then and there.  We do not have much money, so we wanted to go the route of a mediator for the divorce in a year, but should there be any paperwork before hand with how we are splitting the kids' time or items in the home or anything else?  I just want to cover all of my bases and don't know if I've asked all the questions that need to be asked.  Thank you in advance for your help!43759.7659722222 On ###th ###.

Do i legally have to allow our child to go and live out of state even though hes lived in NC his entire life?

Thank you for your time.43759.8486111111 Your ex-husband having moved out of state is a material change from the circumstances that existed at the time you and he executed your custody agreement.  Because of this change of circumstances, you may petition the court to revise the custody order if you do not want to have your son be out of state.43764.6090277778 Dear Mr. ###:Thank you for your question, and my prayers and moral support to you as you ### from your recent surgeries, which I pray have gone very well for you.  Unfortunately, no lawyer is going to do a divorce for free, so you will need to rely upon whatever ### resources you can find.  First, start with your local courthouse where you plan to seek your divorce, and see if the family court section of District Court offers self-help packets for pro se filers in divorce proceedings (some counties do, but not all of them).  Next, consider contacting the law clinics at Wake Forest Law School, ### Law School and ### School of Law.  Here is a link to the latter:### Family Law Clinichttp://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/I looked briefly at the law clinics at ###, ### and ### as well, and did not see any focus on family law, but you can contact them too and see if you can turn up any resources that will aid in your moving forward.If you desire a brief phone or in-person consultation, I suggest using ### Find a Lawyer" feature and searching for some family law attorneys in and near your area.  Look at their Avvo profile pages to see if they offer free consultations (I am sure a few of them do).  If so call their offices and see how long they will talk things through with you without charging you.  Hopefully that will be enough to get you started.The challenge in finding a free lawyer for the long ### is that the average divorce will cost at least $5### child custody and other family law cases for at least three or four years.  So retaining counsel for the long ### will be almost impossible without funds.  I am very sympathetic to your financial ### however.  I hope this will at least point you in the right direction.Take things one day at a time and ### your strength carefully as you prepare for legal needs while bringing your body and spirit back to good health.

At the very least, you as a single mom have a right to (###) partial or full custody of your ###, and (###) child support from the father.  If you and the father of your child cannot work these issues out between yourselves privately, it will take a court hearing in front of a District Court judge to set these rights more firmly, in the form of a written court order as to custody and support.  You would have to file an action and schedule a hearing on your complaint/petition.  While it is hypothetically possible for you to do this on your own, in reality, you need a good local family law attorney to help you work through this process, as it can be a little nuanced and bewildering to someone without legal training.  I would start locally in Union County and see which family law attorneys around might be able to work with you on a payment basis that suits your needs and budget.  Use ### Find a Lawyer" feature if so desired as well as the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association.Also keep in mind the self-help packets that some courthouses in NC (though not all) offer to family law litigants who are not represented by counsel.  Ask the family court section of the District Court in Union County whether they offer self-help filing packets if you are unable to hire counsel at this time.  There are also low-cost resources offered by the North Carolina Central University Family Law Clinic.  Read about them at the link below and place a call to them if needed:###/Hope this helps you somewhat.  Blessings to you and your ###."43761.7180555556 Good afternoon to you, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  North Carolina law allows you to do your own will, but I strongly suggest having an estate planning lawyer prepare one for you if you want to be sure that it is done right, and that the will accomplishes everything that the testator hopes it will.  At bare minimum, a written attested will in North Carolina must be signed by the testator (or by someone directed by the testator) in the presence of two disinterested (i.e., neutral, and non-familial) witnesses.  A self-proving affidavit would be helpful, but is not strictly required; if it is omitted, the witnesses will need to be verified at the time of death, which might be difficult.  Then there is the issue of the substantive provisions of the will itself, which may not necessarily ### what a non-lawyer thinks they ### by reading it without benefit of legal training.  I am sure you can find some estate planning lawyers in NC who would do this for you and your mother for a reasonable ### only a few hundred dollars, if the will and asset situation are relatively simple.  If your mother has a more complicated asset or personal situation, it could be a little more, but this would still be worth your time and investment for the peace of mind in doing it right the first time.  Mistakes and errors discovered during probate are discovered too late, since by then the testator will have already died.Blessings to you and your family this fall.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43761.7402777778 Would I need to hire an attorney to do my mother's will or can I do it myself and then just have it executed and self proved?43761.73125 Ever since a child support modification hearing I requested, my ###'t have to visit with me.

Background: In ###. Then the mother assaulted me at my daughter's school in ###. In ###. Now, because of child support she has lied to my daughter about the modification to get her to not want to visit with me. I have this all documented through our text messages. I also am asking the judge to order counseling for my daughter and I. I divorced her because of physical and emotional abuse and I am in therapy for all this affecting me for so many years. I hope someone is able to help me.43764.5041666667 Is any body able to answer my question?43783.4631944444 Is my question too confusing? Please let me know if you need clarification.43770.4486111111 The court MIGHT find the mother in contempt, if the mother is the reason the child is refusing to visit you.43803.0506944444 Hi, thank you for the information. I initially thought the father and I had a custody agreement in place with our child support agreement. However, I was just made aware that child support and child custody are two separate cases. The only document that was signed by me and my child's father was the child support agreement done through mediation, not through a judge, it has nothing to do with custody. With that in mind, since there is no custody agreement in place do I still need approval from a judge to move? My child's father and I had a verbal agreement before that if I were to ever move out of state that he would be okay with me moving out of state with our son. But I am afraid he will go back on his word since the child support amount is going up and will make things harder now. Could I in this case just agree to a reduced amount if get in writing that I would be allowed to move out of state and that I would get sole legal and physical custody? Or would I need to consult with a lawyer and pursue a child custody case?43768.8479166667 I did a review on my child support this year and the amount went up. This was the second time I have done a child support review since the initial support agreement done through mediation. The first review the amount was going to go up and the father and I came to an agreement that the child support would stay as is with the condition that my son's father would spend more time with our son every weekend. My son's father has violated this agreement each month and continues to do so. Even before the ###st child support review and ever since our son was ###, he was never consistent in our son's, our son is now 9. Our son has lived with me since he was ###. I make all decisions in regards to our son's health, education, schools, sports etc. He is at times not even present on the days he has our son. He is not consistent on the days that he is supposed to pick up our son, it's been like that for ###. His mom and sometimes sister are the ones picking up and dropping off our son. The father only picks our son up or drops him off on rare occasions. My son's grandma, the father's mom, is the one that takes care of our son when he is over at his dad's. The grandma feeds him, ### him, takes care of him, etc. For the second review my son's father asked me for the child support to stay the same. I told him I agree with the amount and that if he didn't we would have to go to court. We went to court in late September and there was no judge present, which we had to reschedule. I have tried communicating with my son's life about having a better communication in place about our son's weekends since he lacks consistency. He did not agree. I want to pursue to get sole legal and physical custody due to the fact that I have been the sole care take of our son since he was ###'s father lack of involvement in our son's life. I also want to know what the law is about moving out of state? I don't think I should have to consult with my son's father about this, or at least should be able to agree on a distance that each parent should be allowed to move? If this is something I want to pursue would it be worth getting an attorney to represent my case that's coming up for child support? 43762.7333333333 Since you do not have a written agreement for custody nor a court order, unless the father agrees to giving you sole physical and legal custody, you might be better off filing a lawsuit for child custody.  You should consult with a local family law attorney about the custody portion of your case and assisting you with negotiating with your child's father to resolve both custody and the child support review.43773.7291666667 These are the issues weâ€™ve identified from your question. ###. Can you get sole custody? ###. Can you move out of the state? ###. Do you need an attorney for your child support case?For the first question, is your initial custody and child support agreement a private contract or a court order, signed by a judge? If it is a private agreement, then your only option to change it would be if he agrees to modify. If he doesnâ€™t agree then you should file a lawsuit for child custody. The standard in North Carolina to make an initial custody determination through the courts is â€œthe best interest of the child.â€ N.C.G.S. 50-######.###.https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_50/GS_50-######.###.pdf If this a judge signed parenting agreement, then your next steps would be to file a motion to modify child custody. The standard to modify child custody is two ### in North Carolina. First, you have to show there has been â€œa substantial change in circumstancesâ€ since the time the judge signed the prior court order. Second, you need to show that this new custody arrangement you are pursuing is in â€œthe best interest of the child.â€ N.C.G.S. 50-######.###. https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_50/GS_50-######.7.pdfYou should make sure you include the follow to show a substantial change in circumstances:Heâ€™s not exercising his custodial time.He is delegating parental duties to his mother and other family members.Anything else that has changed since the first order was signed by a judge.You should also include that you would like to move out of state. If you have a plan, then you need to include those reasons of where you would like to move and why. You should also explain why the move would be in the best interest of your son.For the last question, are you working through child support ### or is this a private lawsuit you have filed? If you are working with child support enforcement, then you should reach out to your case worker to make sure they have all financial information for you and for the father. At the very least, you should have a consultation with a local attorney to determine if you need further help or if the child support enforcement services are enough. If itâ€™s not through child support enforcement, then definitely consult with a local family law attorney so they can review your court orders and evaluate and advise you on how to move forward and your next steps.You can visit the Legal Aid of North Carolina website for assistance on filing for child custody. They have monthly clinics to assist North Carolina residence on pursuing custody and visitation.http://www.legalaidnc.org/get-help/self-help-clinics/child-custody-and-visitationThe following link provides steps and packets of forms with instructions for filing for modification to child custody agreements.###/If you have any follow-up questions, we will leave this question open for response for ten days. Good luck with your matter.43763.7756944444 Hi ###. I am sorry that you are going through such a difficult situation. I hope I can provide some direction for you. The answer to your question starts with the terms of your custody order. In North Carolina a party cannot unilaterally modify the court's order. If the other side is not following a valid court order, your remedy is to seek enforcement of that order through the court's contempt powers. This would essentially be filing a Motion for Contempt alleging that the other side is refusing to comply with a valid court order.When this matter comes up in court the other side gets an opportunity to explain why they are not following the court order. To give you further assistance, it would be helpful to know why the other side is refusing to follow the court order. For example, if the reason for not following the court order is the safety of your child, the court can consider that. On the other hand, if the other side is just mad at you for a minor reason that should not be acceptable to the court. You need to decide if you want to push this matter now or wait for the hearing on ###th. Either way, for you to get your issue in front of the court you will need to file the motion alleging that the other side is not following the court order. 43763.7791666667 My ex-husband got temporary emergency custody of our ### old son at the end of August. In September we had a court date, at that time the custody was amended to give me visitation with my son. The judge signed the court order for the visitations. His lawyer two weeks ago told his to suspend my visitation for an instance that happened that is not related to the custody case. The order has not been amended and the judge continued the case until ###. Can his lawyer do that and does he still have to abide by the court ordered visitation schedule? 43762.7701388889 My husband and I have had custody of his daughter for the last ###+ years because her mother died. The child has been enrolled in a Wake county school and living in our NC home ever since the mother passed. Recently my husband passed away. What do I do to maintain custody?43763.5763888889 You would need to become the Child's legal guardian.  That can be accomplished by visiting your local Clerk of Court office and inquiring with the Clerk's about how to file a Petition to become the Child's legal guardian.  You might also be able to go through the formal adoption process with your local adoption agency after you become the Child's legal guardian.43764.5909722222 My husband and I have had custody of his daughter for the last ###+ years because her mother died. The child has been enrolled in a Wake county school and living in our NC home ever since the mother passed. Recently my husband passed away. What rights does the child's grandmother (the child's moms mother) have in custody and child support and visitation?43763.6305555556 Thank you for your question. Due to the complexities of your circumstance, I advise that you contact a family law attorney to better assist with these issues. Courts consider the best interest of the child when making decisions regarding custody of and visitation with minor children. Typically, grandparents are not responsible for child support, however exceptions exist. Please contact www.legalaidnc.org for additional help and resources to local attorneys who can be of greater assistance. 43763.7583333333 I filed paper work and I got to change the county she lives in. Where it asks if she will resume her maiden name  I checked it and put ### which is wrong as well . They said I had to contact yall to change this ..43763.7951388889 The easiest way to do this would be to file an Amended pleading with the court. You can take the document that you previously filed and add the word Amended to what you have filed. When you submit this amended response to the court, you can change the County and her current name. Then resubmit that to the court. You could also call or go to the court where you filed and confirm they will accept your new response.43764.6 Hello i emailed yall earlier I actually put the wrong name on the case I used her maiden name and in need of changing it also where it says she will use her maiden name this is false also shes keeping her name how it is now and lastly the county where she resides is correct no need to change this .Thank you ### ###43763.8645833333 Hi ###,When you say you put the wrong name on the case, do you mean in the pleading? If the name is wrong on a summons and pleading, aka the paperwork you filed to sue ###, then you probably do not need to change the name on the Summons and initial filing. Service of process in North Carolina is proper if the person being served would reasonably be put on notice that she is being sued. You can look to North Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure Rule ###.However, it may be in your best interest to request the Court to allow you to Amend the pleading and re-serve ### as the correct name. Rule ###  give the court discretion to, at any time, before or after judgment, allow any process or proof of service thereof to be amended, unless it clearly appears that material prejudice would result to substantial rights of the party against whom the process issued.In this instance it's probably very clear to ### that she is being included in this particular suit; however, you can always ask the Court through a written motion to allow you to amend your pleading in order to correct a clerical error like this one. It's likely considered harmless error and the Court will likely be willing to allow you to do this. If you put her name wrong elsewhere then you will still need to ask the Court to allow you to amend whatever document to which you are referring in order to correct a harmless clerical error.I hope this helps.43768.6243055556 Good evening, Ms. Rider:Thank you for your question.  Strictly speaking, you do not have" to have a lawyer for this although retaining one would make the process considerably easier since s/he would be familiar not only with the substantive family law of North Carolina but also the procedural and practical ### that helps one navigate the court system.  If you are really determined to do this on your own and you have time to devote to all of this I do believe you can do it but it will require a lot of your time and energy.  If the ### County District Court offers self-help filing packets that is a good thing since it will ### aid in your doing this ###.  You can also check with the North Carolina Central University Family Law Clinic in ### which also offers a self-help packet for relatively low cost (around $### $25 the last time I checked).  See the link here if needed:###/Finally if needed you can consult either the ### County Public Library or the library at Catawba College ### Family Law in North Carolina a wonderful legal treatise about how to pursue family law-related cases in this state as well as any family law practice guides that the library might offer.

We had a ppo in place ### has lapsed. I am attempting to file for divorce and custody doing the self filing. I am not sure as to why I need an attorney to do this. 43765.9215277778 Good afternoon, Mrs. ###:Thank you for your question, and I hope fall has commenced well for you and your children.  For the most part, yours is a manageable situation, and far less complicated than many divorces, but there will still be a few ### that will likely require a lawyer's expertise to straighten out before this is complete.  First, if you have been physically separated since ###, you can file for divorce at any time (including immediately) since you, under such presumed facts, would have more than met the one-year separation rule in North Carolina.  Second, your spouse being out of state is of small matter, since you can still file for divorce as the plaintiff in North Carolina, as long as you have a physical address at which you can serve your husband in that state with the initial complaint and ### by certified mail, process server or local sheriff, depending on how cooperative your husband wishes to be in keeping this process smooth.  Once the initial service happens by one of the methods I ### to Rule ###--you can send all other notices relating to the court by regular first-class mail.Either spouse can file after at least one year's separation, AND as long as at least one spouse (does not have to be both) has been living continuously in NC for at least six months.  So far, so good....Now, what might complicate this a little is if there needs to be a dispute in court over child support for your ### old child.  You and your husband can enter into a separation agreement if you think that would be ### in terms of his meeting his obligations, but otherwise, you will want to raise this issue with the judge, who has broad power to enforce the child support obligations, especially if they were imposed by a NC court in a prior hearing.  I am not quite sure yet how this piece of the puzzle will play out, since I am not privy to the details of your situation.A separation agreement could also preempt any need of litigating issues as to property division, custody of the ###-old child, and any other matters relating to finances, health insurance, etc., that you and your husband would like to work out through a private, legally binding agreement, versus a legal fight in open court.  Otherwise, your situation is relatively simple, and might be resolved through what is called a su###y judgment divorce whereby the complaint sets out the basic facts of your separation, and is sworn under oath as an affidavit, followed by a motion for the actual divorce decree to be issued after the defendant (your husband) has been properly noticed of the pending divorce litigation.  If there are no issues to contest, the divorce will be granted in just a couple months, but if there are still issues that you and your husband contest, that might add a couple more months to the litigation.You can file for divorce on your own, without counsel if you wish, although it will be difficult to navigate the complexities of the court system without legal training and experience.  If cost is a prohibitive issue in terms of hiring local family law counsel, consider inquiring of the New ### District Court whether its family law section offers self-help filing packets for pro se litigants in divorce and child ### proceedings.  Also consider contacting the North Carolina Central University Family Law Clinic in ###, which I believe offers limited guidance and a file it yourself" packet for around $### $25 the last time I checked.

Both reside with me full time and he is very behind on child support. Years behind. Thank you!43766.6777777778 Thank you so much!we do actually have a separation agreement from when we initially did separate. So that sounds like it will make things go smoothly also. I will look into the do it yourself packets! 43766.7020833333 That is a very encouraging report, Mrs. ###.  It sounds like your divorce will actually be rather simple and should not be that costly, even if you hire a lawyer.  You still might be able to do this on your own, but be sure that you study the procedure carefully.  Read N.C.G.S. Chapter ###.net, and at ###, read the Local Rules" that apply to New ### District Court; the judge will expect you to follow the same rules that licensed lawyers who regularly appear in ### do.The ### ### to the child support issue is that your getting an expeditious divorce is not contingent upon this; even after the divorce is finalized and official you can still apply to a court for relief for child support if your husband has not gotten himself current on his obligations on that front.As long as both sides are honoring their part of the separation agreement this should be a lot faster and cleaner than many divorces I have seen in the past.Blessings to you and the kids### A. ### ### Esq."43766.7069444444 Good Morning, I have a situation that my partner (we'll call her ### -names changed for privacy) and I are stuck in and I don't believe there is much we can do, but I wanted to ask. About a year ago ### and her ex split up (we'll call the ex ###). ### has two children that the two of them raised for about ###. ### acted as a parent to the children, although they were never adopted and the two were never married. Because of nothing other than jealousy, ### will not allow me around the children (ages ### ###), and allows ### to still act as a parent, as long as I am not around. This of course prevents us from things like living together, as I would have to stay elsewhere when the children are around out of respect for ###'s wishes. Any time ### is reminded of me in any capacity, she reminds ### that she can pull the children away at any moment. I try to keep as low a profile as possible and often time am walking on eggshells.I understand that ### is not a legal guardian, and although she acted as a parent, and the children see her as a parent, our hands are tied. I just wanted to make sure that I'm correct in the feeling that we have to just go along with whatever ### (biological mom) says, and have no room at all to argue or get any sort of freedom from this situation. Thank you very much in advance for your time. 43767.7256944444 Hello, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and for your professionalism and courtesy.  I think that you correctly analyzed this situation legally, as best I can tell from the information I read in your fact summary here.  The word of the biological or legally adopted parent usually controls, absent a court order or consent decree ### by the court to the contrary.  If ### really wanted to take this fight to its ultimate extent, I believe it is far more likely than not that she would prevail in court, especially since she and ### were not ever legally married, and only one half of that previous relationship was the biological or legally adopted parent.  There can sometimes be narrow exceptions for persons who for years in duration have stood in loco parentis" for the child but such instances are very rare.  The law overwhelmingly favors the wishes of the biological or legally adopted parent above all others.  Nonetheless this should not stop you from at least consulting once with a local family law attorney if you believe that compelling grounds exist to persuade a judge that your being excluded from the child's life is a grave material harm to that child.  You would have an uphill battle of course but until a lawyer becomes fully and intimately aware of the entire situation no member of this profession can tell you for certain what will come of this matter if a dispute concerning the child ends up in court.Wish I could offer a more definite answer but there is never a ### way to anticipate child custody disputes.  A lot depends on the judge who hears your case as well.Blessings and best wishes to you."43767.9138888889 Thank you very much for your quick and professional response, I very very much appreciate it! Have a good evening, and Happy Halloween since it's only a could days away!43767.9159722222 Good evening, Ms. Woods:Thanks so much for reaching out to us on NC Free Legal Answers.  I hope your fall is going well.  You raise a good question, and I will try to steer you in the right direction as you finalize your initial inventory.  I commend you for taking on the sometimes onerous task of estate fiduciary, which I know your mother would approve.Section ###, and fair market value, of the property, IF (###) your mother died single, (###) there was no life estate on the deed to this property, and (###) there was no will designating the property to be inherited" by the estate.  It is all but likely that all three is so since your mother died without a will (thereby precluding Sections ### 7) and if your mother was not married at the time of death (thereby precluding any tenancy by the entirety relationship to the property since that can exist only between married persons in NC).  The only thing left to check before your fill out this section is the deed just to confirm that this is not a life estate-i###ted property.  If there is a life estate in the deed and it clearly designates who is to receive the "remainder" interest after your mother's death you would not fill out any of the sections relating to real property in the AOC form since there is no real estate to probate at all; the deed does all the work in terms of transferring the interest to the ### rather than a will or probate estate proceeding.  Otherwise if no life estate and the other two factors I mentioned are also confirmed your mother's real property would go under Section ###.  Also indicate in the spaces provided whether there are any other structures on the property besides the ### sheds detached garages etc.As you may know already in North Carolina real property not specifically designated in a will does not automatically go into the estate but is vested immediately in the heirs-at-law at the time of the owner's death (this would likely be you and any other siblings you have in equal shares with any grandchildren who are the issue of any predeceased members of the second generation also taking a share according to the number of issue the predeceased child left behind).  If after dealing with your mother's creditors you discover that the resources from cash and personal property are not sufficient to satisfy outstanding obligations you would then be required to petition the Clerk to place the real property inside the estate in order to sell and pay off the remaining debts and obligations.  If your mother left no such obligations or if the obligations can be satisfied by other ###s the property never enters the estate in any formal sense (although you must still list it in Section ###) and the heirs-at-law are the vested owners.  If/when you decide to sell after the estate is closed your closing lawyer would reference your mother's estate file number to show the buyer's lawyer how you obtained title to the property.  Or you can simply have a lawyer issue a new deed to all heirs for the property during probate if you wish to have your name on an actual recorded instrument even before any/all of the heirs decide to sell.So far I think you are on the right track.  Getting through this will take time so just take it one step at a time ###.  Ask the Clerk's staff for help as well; they will provide as much helpful feedback as they can without giving you legal advice.Hope this helps somewhat.Best### A. ### ### Esq."43768.0638888889 I am my Mother's administrator of her estate, she passed away ###.

The attorney you spoke with is somewhat correct but didn't give the full picture. In North Carolina, a parent may not change the name of a minor child without the consent of the other parent, except in the following instances: the other parent is deceased; the minor child has reached the age of 16; the minor child has the consent of the custodial parent who has supported the minor child and the clerk of court is satisfied that the non-custodial parent has abandoned the minor child; orthe non-custodial parent has been adjudicated as having abandoned the minor child.You said the father agreed to the name change when you contacted him, do you have this in writing? Was it a text or an email? If so, this may be enough for the Clerk to consider this message as his consent to the name change. But that is no guarantee.If your child is ###/her name changed with the ### County Clerk of Court. A minor who has reached the age of ###, without the necessity of obtaining the consent of the other parent, when the clerk of court is satisfied that the other parent has abandoned the minor. The ###. Failure to pay child support is one of those.If he/she is not over the age of ###, but you must be able to show that the father consented, has abandoned the child, or has committed one of the crimes listed in N.C.G.S. Section 101-2(d)(3). If the Clerk will not accept the message as consent, or if he has not committed one of the crimes, then your only resource is to show that he abandoned the child.To establish abandonment, you will need to present the Clerk with a copy of an order, from a court of competent jurisdiction, adjudicating that the minor child has been abandoned by the parent. If there is no order, you would need to file a motion to ask the Court to declare that the child has been abandoned. The Court will look to the factors set out in N.C.G.S. Section ###-###.I would be remiss if I did not tell you that abandonment proceedings are serious and have serious consequences. If you are successful, the non custodial parent will lose almost all or all of his parental rights and in some instances MAY NO LONGER BE OBLIGATED TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT. I want to emphasize this point, that if the parent has no parental rights, then he may not obligated to pay for the child. In some cases the Court will continue to make him pay child support despite not having parental rights, but this is not always the case.I hope this helps.43768.7208333333 I live in NC and I want to change my minors name I contacted the father and he agreed but when it was time to meet up he never responded and hasnâ€™t since. A lawyer I spoke to told me I could file a name change without his consent if he is delinquent paying child support and if he hasnâ€™t seen the kids is this true? I really want to change the name but he has ignored me after agreeing and after multiple attempts 43768.1083333333 Thank you for sending this follow up. Based on the facts available to me it does appear you would not successfully be able to change the name without proceeding with abandonment first. The Clerk can only rely on the available law and right now that means that you must show a court order stating that he has abandoned the child.If he hasn't seen the children in three years and if he's neglecting to pay support then you likely have a case for abandonment. This would require a petition to the court and proceedings would follow. There are several steps to completing this. As Family Law is not my area of expertise I would recommend calling a family law attorney, or contacting Legal Aid of North Carolina for better more qualified advise for any petition you'd like to file. However, I must reiterate that in the event his parental rights are terminate he may no longer be obligated to pay child support. In some instances the court may order him to pay, but I want to make that very clear before you proceed with this. I understand that he isn't currently paying anyway, but that's a crime and it's also possible for you to seek legal support with forcing him to pay. If his rights are terminated he may not have that legal obligation anymore.43769.5333333333 I am in ### County. Could you please provide me with those documents? I greatly appreciate the link and the other information. That is what I was not able to find in my own search. 43780.9951388889 Ms. Little,To notify the Court that the child's father is violating the child custody order, you will need to file a Motion to Show Cause. Instructions for how to do so along with the forms that you will need to file are attached to this message.

This agreement is most likely not enforceable since it is not part of any court order or consent decree between the parents, and entered formally by the District Court Judge who ### over family law matters in your county.  While texts can be confirmation of a legally binding agreement in some instances (such as an informal loan agreement), but in this instance, it will be hard to enforce such an agreement without the involvement of the court in a more formal (and written) agreement.  If this situation is relatively stable for everyone ### the child, above ### no major negative events occur, you and your former partner may be able to continue more or less as you once did, but ### major disagreements about this situation start to materialize, you will need a court order or consent decree of some kind if you hope to enforce certain boundaries on the other partner.  If financial means allow, I would consult locally with a family law attorney and obtain more precise advice about a possible hearing in Union County District Court.  If not, see if the family court section of the District Court there offers self-help packets with respect to child custody.  You can also contact the ### Family Law Clinic and, for a relatively small sum ($### $25, the last time I checked), obtain a file it yourself" packet to use.  You will be better off represented by experienced family law counsel in your local community but in a less than ideal situation I hope you can obtain the resources necessary to proceed in court and protect your child's best interests.Blessings to you and your child this fall and winter."43769.5590277778 If two people share a kid but never married and ### had a verbal along with a text message agreement to not bring any new significant other into our child's life until we met tha significant other .

This is a very tricky situation, as I know you well understand.  Your marriage ceremony itself in a church appears to meet the requirements of N.C.G.S. Â§ 5###-###, but the question now is whether your inability to produce a marriage certificate would be a ### barrier by which to establish certain rights to either alimony (if legally married) or palimony (if the finding is that you are not legally married).  Honestly, I cannot say for certain since it is not entirely clear whether you are married" under North Carolina law.  Palimony payments are very rare in NC but are possible if there are written agreements between the cohabiting couples; or if there was a promise by one partner to support the other after the relationship ended; or if there are significant childcare burdens borne by one partner rather than the other; or if one partner sacrificed his/her career for the sake of the other; or if there is a significant disparity in incomes between the two partners.  A family law attorney you consult with locally can confirm whether your disability is also a factor (I suspect it would be in your favor).If it turns out that you are considered legally married despite not having a written certificate you are correct in thinking that your partner's relationship (which in this case would indeed be adultery) would factor into an alimony situation.  Marital misconduct for alimony is broad under N.C.G.S. Â§ 50-###6.3A (directly from the statute):(###) The marital misconduct of either of the spouses. Nothing herein ### a court from considering incidents of post ### ### as corroborating evidence supporting other evidence that ### occurred during the marriage and prior to date of separation;(2) The relative earnings and earning capacities of the spouses;(3) The ages and the physical mental and emotional conditions of the spouses;(4) The amount and sources of earned and unearned income of both ### but not limited to earnings dividends and benefits such ### retirement insurance social security or others;(5) The duration of the marriage;(6) The contribution by one spouse to the education training or ### power of the other spouse;(7) The extent to which the earning power expenses or financial obligations ofa spouse will be affected by reason of serving as the custodian of a minorchild;(8) The standard of living of the spouses established during the marriage;(9) The relative education of the spouses and the time necessary to ### education or training to enable the spouse seeking alimony to ### to meet his or her reasonable economic needs;(###0) The relative assets and liabilities of the spouses and the relative debt ### of the spouses including legal obligations of support;(######) The property brought to the marriage by either spouse;(###2) The contribution of a spouse as homemaker;(###3) The relative needs of the spouses;(###4) The federal State and local tax ramifications of the alimony ### 50-###6.3A Page 2(###5) Any other factor relating to the economic circumstances of the parties thatthe court finds to be just and proper.(###6) The fact that income received by either party was previously considered bythe court in determining the value of a marital or divisible asset in ### distribution of the parties' marital or divisible property.I think you have some options here but it will really require your hiring a seasoned family law attorney who knows what s/he is ### someone who regularly appears in front of the District Court judges in your ### be essential to obtaining whatever relief to which you are entitled to the maximum degree.  I hope that you can work out the money somehow so you can receive high-quality advocacy for you and the child.Blessings to you and yours this fall and winter."43769.6965277778 Good evening to you, Ms. ###:I hope Thanksgiving yesterday was rewarding to you.  I noticed that this question has been in the open answers queue for a month now, and wanted to offer a few thoughts just in case you still need a little guidance.The good news is that, as you said, your divorce is relatively simple and straightforward, and we can be grateful for that because, once you can actually show proof of service under Rule ###, serving all other ###, notices of hearing, briefs, affidavits, and the eventual divorce decree ### be far easier because it can be done by first-class mail under Rule 5.  I anticipate that you will be able to obtain a summary judgment" divorce even if your husband does not respond to subsequent mailings or participate in any hearings.The less than ideal news of course is that you still have to prove proper initial service under Rule ###.  Unfortunately unless you can find a physical address at which your husband can be ### served with the Complaint and Summons by a deputy sheriff or process server there is not much else to do except serve by publication  Rule ###(j1) is very specific about how to do this and the guidelines are reasonably accessible to a non-lawyer.  I realize that cost might be an immediate hurdle for you but at this point based on what you described about your husband's situation this is most likely your last and only viable option.  See Rule ### ###(j1) towards the bottom of the text:https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_1A/GS_1A-1_Rule_###.htmlA table of contents view of the Rules (which can help you browse and look at Rule ###) can be viewed here:###It sounds like you have a good grasp of how to do this at least although working through the logistics and cost of service by publication may still require some patience burden and expense.

I know he isn't living there. It seems likely that I am going to have go the route of divorce by publication, which I am not financially able to do( I receive SSDI). Also, I have read that it is best to consult an attorney before going this route. This is a simple, absolute divorce. No children or property are involved. He is a long time drug addict, and abused me for most of the marriage. I have a current DVPO and  filed the paperwork today to have the order renewed.  I tried Legal Aid, but they do not provide services for divorces. What is the best way to go forward? 43769.7381944444 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and I hope that Thanksgiving went well for you and your family, despite the present contemplation of divorce.  If you have not already, you should have this question and all others regarding equitable distribution, alimony, ### support, child custody, etc. negotiated in the form of a written Separation and Property Settlement Agreement.  I have seen such agreements in the past between military personnel and a non-military spouse, and my experience of that case was that as long as the Department of ### personnel regulations allowed for certain splits or payments to be made to a spouse in a written, valid agreement (such as a separation agreement), the arrangement was fine.  You really need a good local family law attorney, however, to look out for you in this regard, since your husband will be at an advantage since he will have access to the Defense Department's ### counsel who are available to advise active-duty service members on a range of legal matters, including divorce and domestic relations.  I would try to retain local family law counsel in ### County (or one of the nearby counties), if you have not done so already.  I personally can recommend ### ### of the ### (### County) firm of ### & Van Hoy, LLP (###-###).  You might have other ideas as well.

You will need to consult locally in ### County with a family law attorney on this one.  The kind of result you are seeking will most likely require a court order or consent decree that the ### County District Court judge in the family law section would have to ###.  This will almost certainly require at least short-term legal representation, which might be more affordable than it would be in a long-term, highly disputed custody battle.  The least thing to do for now is to go to a local law firm and request a ### ### initial consultation on this matter, and get help ### out a ### of options you can consider over the next month or so.  If you are ready to proceed by that time, you can then follow up with the attorney with whom you consulted, and then go from there.  This will likely include several steps over a few months, so get started as soon as you ### next week, if you have the time and can afford a consultation fee.  I wish you the best in this matter.43770.7958333333 As the only caregiver for my child for four years how much weight does that carry in how much visitation is awarded to my childâ€™s father? The father entered my childâ€™s life about ###.43772.2159722222 Good Sunday to you, Ms. ###:Thank you for your very important question.  A North Carolina District Court judge will entertain a wide range of factors in making custody and visitation decisions, although the bottom line is ALWAYS what is in the best interests of the child, overall.  Yes, I do believe that your being the primary caregiver will be a highly relevant and persuasive factor in the judge's thinking if this ever ends up in family court.  On the other hand, every District Court judge whom I know also thinks it highly desirable, unless there is compelling character evidence to prove the contrary, that a child is best served when s/he has access to both biological parents; typically, a judge will not prevent a parent from visitation or custody relating to the child if there is no evidentiary grounds on which to conclude that the parent seeking visitation is morally unfit to be in the child's life.In North Carolina generally, District Courts are required to consider joint custody if one party requests it.  A joint custody award may give both parents legal custody (referring to joint decision-making authority), while giving one parent physical custody of the child, with visitation to the other.  Also, joint custody may be ordered when both parents want sole custody.  If a parent who does not have physical custody is denied visitation, the court must make written findings of fact that the parent is an unfit person to visit the child or that such visitation rights are not in the best interest of the child."  This is a high standard so compelling evidence must be ### in court (including but not limited to live court testimony by the parties and any relevant witnesses knowledgeable about the situation) and when this does happen there is often evidence of abuse or other ### of serious misconduct by the party being denied custody and/or visitation.  (Note that unwed parents are entitled to the same visitation considerations as married parents so the marital status of you and your child's father will not be a material issue in the case although the judge will likely make a brief note of it.)I hope this gives you a general sense of the factors a court will most likely entertain in making a thoughtful decision about what is in the best interests of your child.  Custody and visitation cases are difficult to pursue on your own so hopefully if/when the time comes you will have a good local family law attorney in your corner to achieve the best and most fair results.  Blessings to you and your child this winter."43772.7368055556 Good evening, and a blessed Thanksgiving to you, Ms. Brown:I noticed that this question had not been answered yet, and want to therefore offer a few comments in contemplation of your filing.

This is governed by N.C.G.S.

If so, visit the courthouse and see what they have to offer you.

However if your daughter is physically present in North Carolina and there is good cause to believe that abuse neglect or abandonment is at issue you can seek an emergency order from the District Court judge which will last only for a temporary period of time until a more permanent finding can be made by the court after hearing from both parents in a custody trial.

NC law required that your husbandâ€™s name be on the birth certificate. If your husband is the biological father, you will not need to do anything else to establish paternity. If you and your husband divorce, he will be responsible for paying child support.Your husband can however rebut the presumption that he is the biological father by presenting evidence to a court that his is not the biological father and should not be required to pay child support. This evidence might include medical reports showing that he is infertile or DNA test results indicating that he is not the biological father.I hope this helps answer your question. Thank you for reaching out.43784.0847222222 My husband claims that even though he signed my sons birth certificate when he was born, he will not be obligated to pay child support because he is not his biological father. Is this true? 43773.7347222222 Absolutely, Ms. ###.  Be well, and best wishes in your altruistic efforts.43775.8951388889 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for this very important question.  Normally I would say that a custody proceeding between a parent and non-parent will be quite an uphill battle, the factors you mentioned here, if proven and establish in Wake County District Court (assuming that is where the mother and child lives at present), will make it a lot easier for you to prevail in a custody matter than it would normally be, given that you are not a biological parent (although you are a relative).  You will definitely need to hire a family law attorney, as this type of case would be very difficult to pursue on one's own as a non-lawyer.  (Note that you could not simply arrange, outside of court, for this custody outcome that you desire; there would have to be an adversarial proceeding between you and the mother, even if you do not really see yourselves as adversaries" in real life outside of court.  Our legal system requires opposing parties in litigation matters including custody proceedings so the likely ### would be you as the plaintiff seeking custody versus the mother as a defendant.)Here are some general points about custody law that you should keep in mind which I think will be helpful in thinking through the entire situation.  Your attorney that you hire will be able to ### much further on these points than I or anyone else can in an online forum such as this.  Note the following below:Federal and North Carolina state courts have interpreted the ###4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to establish a fundamental right of biological parents to raise care for and have authority over their minor children; this is known in North Carolina as the "### Presumption."  In normal situations in any custody battle between a parent and a non-parent the parent wins based on the ### principle.  However in exceptional circumstances this ### can be rebutted in ### cases where the District Court judge finds that the parent is (###) unfit (###) has neglected the child (###) or has engaged in conduct inconsistent with the parental status.  Any number or combination of these factors could lead to a judge reversing the ### presumption and ruling in favor of the non-parent but since the Constitution is interpreted to protect biological parents' rights to their own children the grounds for going against this must be high and readily apparent based on the evidence produced in court during the custody trial.  Otherwise even if the judge privately does not like or approve of the conduct of the parent s/he will rule in favor of the parent in order to avoid being overturned on appeal based on constitutional grounds.As to "conduct inconsistent with parental status that can mean many things depending on a case-by-case basis, but basically you are trying to show here that the parent is not only a bad influence" on the child (which is subjective and is not by itself grounds to terminate a parent's custody rights) but that the parent is morally unfit to raise the child and/or poses a serious risk to the child's healthy development and safety.  I believe that the factors you described in your post if true would likely meet this standard.  Ultimately it is up to the District Court judge to decide but the more solid your evidence in support of what you have talked about here the more likely that the judge will out of an abundance of caution regarding the child's safety would consider reversing the ### principle and awarding you custody of the child.This is a brief summary of the factors at work.  What you need to do now is search for a reputable and caring family law attorney whom you can trust and afford.  ### "Find a Lawyer" feature is a useful (and free) resource and you might also consider contacting the Wake County Bar ### County Bar and the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association for possible referrals.I commend you Ms. ### for wishing to step up and do the right thing for your young relative.

Since then he has had a baby and left the state, but refusing to give me a divorce. I have made several requests but Iâ€™m unable to get him to do so. He keeps telling me to send the paperwork. I agreed to file but he also have to sign and now he will not respond. The courts say u less heâ€™s served I canâ€™t do anything. I have no address only the name and phone number of the company he works for. What are my options? We have a court date for child support but he refuses to attend and states heâ€™s going to â€œride out until my son is ###â€.  We go court on the 21st but the state says even tho they know where he works they are unable to do anything he the police canâ€™t make contact. He has three warrants so I know he will not answer the police. I have done all I can, but one son in college and another in high school has all fallen on me. My job just closed this location and I worked light do to me being a Pastor wife in the church. What are my options?

Yes, you are correct: if your ex-wife is the party bringing the Motion to Show Cause for hearing in court, she is the plaintiff for that purpose and not the defendant.  It appears that she is doing this without a lawyer, which might explain the error.  However, such an error is cosmetic in nature, and will have no bearing on having the motion dismissed, or not having the matter heard in court, as long as you were noticed ten (10) calendar days before the hearing date.  I would focus more on the merits and substance (or lack thereof, depending on your take on the allegations), rather than minor details such as this error, since the matter is more than likely to be heard on substantive grounds anyway.I appreciate your question, and hope for a fair and just result, either way.  Have a blessed winter and Thanksgiving holiday when it arrives.43774.9645833333 I apologize for the looks of this but I could not copy and paste.

I will first say that as long as you consent to your boyfriend's role in your daughter's life and he does nothing that is illegal (and there is no reason for me to think this is happening), there is really nothing your mother or anyone else can do, legally speaking.  Your mother can make noise and wild accusations, but that is the extent of it.  Your permission as the custodial parent of your daughter ultimately decides these matters until your daughter reaches the age of eighteen.If you really felt that you needed your boyfriend to have something in writing, you might consider something like a durable power of attorney or proxy agreement, which should be drafted and reviewed with you by a family law attorney or an estate planning attorney.  However, I do not believe that is in any way necessary since you have the legal right to decide which minors and/or adults your daughter gets to spend time with when she is not in school.If your mother is making public statements that falsely characterize the relationship between your daughter and your boyfriend, you might consider hiring a local attorney to send her a cease and desist letter, ### warning that if she does not immediately and permanently stop these slanders against you, your daughter and/or your boyfriend, she runs the serious risk of being sued for defamation.These are the options I can think of that make practical sense based on what you described in your posting, although I think that for the most part, you and your boyfriend being careful about public appearances regarding the daughter and boyfriend's movements in the eyes of others, and simply putting up with a difficult relative until your daughter is ###, would be the most likely way you would go forward.  If not, see a local attorney for more precise guidance and advice.I wish all of you a blessed Thanksgiving in a couple weeks, and a safe and productive winter winter in ### County.43775.0027777778 My daughter is ### ###. My boyfriend picks her up sometimes when I am not with them and takes her places (i.e. grocery store, work, school, etc). I do not have a problem with this nor does my daughter.My mother hates my boyfriend for the simple fact that he has asked me to marry him and, in turn, she is losing control over my life. She has made false accusations on past boyfriends before going as far as to call ###'s therapist's office when she was only ###.I was wondering if there is some sort of legal document that can be drawn up to keep with him stating that I give him permission for my daughter to be with him. He is an Active Duty Army Staff ### and doesn't need my mother's hatred for him to ruin his ###. Any advice is greatly appreciated.43774.9902777778 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  If your husband has a lawyer, service is proper by effecting the same upon his counsel, not on him directly, regardless of the extent of legal representation.  I would ### challenge any movement by the other side to dismiss your counterclaim based on improper service (Rule 12(b)(5) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure) or for judgment without making the court first aware that you timely filed and served a responsive pleading and counterclaim based on Rule ###.  Under Rule 5, you serve the opposing party's lawyer, unless the party is unrepresented by counsel, in which case service directly upon that person by first-class mail or hand delivery is sufficient.  In any event, even if the lawyer's incorrect premise that service upon him is insufficient is taken seriously (which it should not), merely mailing by regular mail the ### papers is sufficient service.  You have satisfied the service requirements for briefs motions and other court papers" of Rule ### assuming you sent and filed a Certificate of Service with the information that Rule ###.Also please note that separation agreements are not typically "filed" with the court but are merely incorporated by written reference in the complaint answer counterclaim or judgment order.See the NC Rules of Civil Procedure here:###Hope this helps.

Your options are (###) to prepare, file and serve an Answer in response to the Complaint in the case, (###) file a Motion to Extend Time for another additional ### (if you file it within the initial ###0-day window), or (###) admit all allegations in the Complaint by default, by not answering within the allowed time.Should you prepare an Answer, it must do more than simply say, No."  You need to respond to each and every enumerated paragraph of the Complaint using a format very similar to that used in the Complaint and "Admit" or "Deny" every factual allegation made.  In response to the "### for Relief" clause in the Complaint you need to detail what you asking the Court to do for you should the Court side with ### such as denying the relief "prayed" for in the Complaint or whatever else you believe to which you are entitled.The Answer needs to be filed with the Court with a ### copy mailed to the opposing party's lawyer (or the opposing party directly if that party is unrepresented by counsel) by first class mail along with a Certificate of Service pursuant to Rule ###.  See a link to the Rule below:https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_###A/GS_###A-###_Rule_5.html(You should also retain a ### copy of whatever you file as well so be prepared to have at least three (###) signed originals ready for the Clerk to stamp both of the Answer and the Certificate of Service accompanying.  You need to mail a ### copy of both when serving the other party and you can also do this by personal delivery per Rule 5.)You should also examine the "Local Rules" that apply at your courthouse in Orange County by looking them up at ###.  Local rules apply at each courthouse and detail what judges expect when appearing in front of them in your local ### this case Orange & ### Counties which are part of the same judicial district.This should be enough to get you started.  I suggest that you work quickly and when you have your draft of the Answer and Certificate of Service go see a local family law attorney for limited guidance in having the documents reviewed with possible changes before filing with the Clerk and serving.

However, I am aware that this does not make the process more hurtful, and I sincerely respect that.  I wish you ### financial resources, and peace of mind, going forward.  Upward and onward to better things of life.43776.9854166667 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  In North Carolina, either party may seek a divorce based on separation of one year, as long as at least one spouse has lived continuously in North Carolina for at least six (6) months prior to the divorce proceedings.  Assuming that you do not reconcile in the interim, therefore, either spouse can sue for divorce beginning ###.  If your husband engaged in any kind of marital misconduct (including but not limited to ### adultery, abuse, neglect or other serious misconduct during the marriage), or if you were the dependent spouse as the one with a significantly lower income (or no income at all, due to ### roles during the marriage), you may be eligible for post-separation support, and/or ### in a lump sum payment, or in installments, depending on what the judge orders.  Judges tend to look at the income patterns of the two spouses during the marriage and make allowances for the spouse who was dependent on the primary breadwinner, even though the non or ### spouse made significant contributions to the household otherwise.  The length of the marriage, the standard of living that the married couple enjoyed, and the property each spouse brought into the marriage matters as well, and of course also whether one spouse is more involved in the children's lives, assuming children are in the picture.If you wish to seek alimony or post-separation support, speak with a local family law attorney in the next month or two, and try to come up with whatever funds you can as you wait for the one year separation period to run.  If there are no significant assets to split and no minor children to consider, this will be a relatively simple and inexpensive divorce; otherwise, you will need a good attorney if you wish to come out of this with a fair result, especially if your husband has extra funds by which to hire counsel of his own.  You still have some time until the divorce can be sued for in order to make some short-term and long-term financial planning.  Ask around in town and see what this might cost, and whether any of the local family law attorneys in your county would consider a payment plan that might make representation more affordable.If you decide that you are unwilling or unable to hire counsel anyway, I would contact the courthouse and see if the family law section of the District Court Division has a self-help packet that you might be able to fill out and file, and try to do this on your own; it will be difficult but is still possible if you are willing to put the time in to move this forward.  Also contact the ### Family Law Clinic in ### to see if they can make available to you any resources that you can use for free.  See the link below:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/At your local public library, you might also find an edition of ### North Carolina Family Law, by far the best legal treatise in North Carolina on family law generally.  You can also see if your library has civil motion practice books in family law, which will give you a sense of how to pursue a case by yourself in District Court.  If you do so, look up the local rules for the courthouse in Onslow County, found at ###.Lastly, here is the statute that shows what types of conduct the court will consider for awarding alimony to a spouse (see below):###AND post-separation support:###I hope this information is helpful as you plan for the period between now and next March.

Again thank you for your time43776.9819444444 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for posting this very important question.  Essentially what you need is a modification of the child custody order that you attached here (thank you for doing so), based on a substantial change in the minor children's circumstances.  This is governed by N.C.G.S. Â§ ###  Note that there must be a substantial" change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the child.  Normally speaking relocation remarriage or an increase or decrease in the parents' incomes by and of themselves will not justify a modification UNLESS it can be shown that they affect the child's welfare and material interests in a substantial way.If you believe you have grounds to modify you would need to file a complaint to modify the custody order in the ### County District Court Division as the plaintiff and serve the grandmother the defendant by certified mail in Florida or by local sheriff or process server.  Because child support matters are adversarial proceedings even when there is agreement between the two parties a lawsuit must still be filed although in this case a consent order might be entered upon the advice and consent of both parties with the final approval by the District Court ### the previous order can simply be modified to incorporate the new changes in the children's life situations.  What I am less sure of is whether you can handle guardianship and custody in one order; I suspect you can since judges have much more power to decide these matters than do Clerks of Superior ### latter being the party that usually hears guardianship matters but you will need to check with a ### County family law attorney before making any concrete decisions.  Without legal counsel this is possible but would be much more difficult than would otherwise be the case.  I hope that you can find a reputable attorney in the local ### who knows the District Court judges very ### can work with you on this on terms you can afford.Have a blessed Thanksgiving and winter.

While emergency custody hearings are available in cases where the child is present in North Carolina and is either abandoned or in imminent peril of ### or abuse, I do not think that situation applies here based on your brief description of the situation.

You would have to file a Complaint to begin the action, alleging the facts you wish to establish in support of your desired custody award from the court.  A full custody case can take anywhere from a few to several months, depending on how contentious the matter is, and how much evidence is required to be gathered for both sides.  A lawyer is not required but highly recommended, as it will be difficult to navigate the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule of Evidence, and ### County District Court local rules without a lawyer.  You can, however, ask at the ### County Courthouse whether the family court section provides self-help packets for custody matters; you might also consider contacting the ### Family Law Clinic to see if they can offer you free legal advice, and the low-cost ###" packet.

The first two times she was incarcerated and moved from one prison to a different one send them to attempt did not work. The last attempt was approximately ###.

This is a very difficult situation.  What you are referring to generally is termination of parental rights based on neglect, ###, abuse or abandonment, and yes, these can all be adequate grounds for terminating what is otherwise a biological parent's 14th Amendment constitutional rights to care for and raise one's own child.  Although the ### principle" (i.e. the court's interpretation that the 14th Amendment protects a biological parent's fundamental right to his/her own child until the child reaches the age of legal majority) is very strong and is not ### lightly since there is always the possibility of the judge being appealed it can and sometimes is ### when compelling instances such as those I have described are at issue.  Based on what you wrote in your fact summary these issues if proven can likely result in your being awarded sole and exclusive custody of your ### even with no visitation.  (It will depend though since abandonment alone is not grounds for denying visitation although it can be for custody.)You would need to file a custody lawsuit in ### County District Court and serve the mother with the complaint and summons as she would be the defendant.  Rule ### (see at this link: ###).I recommend hiring a local family law attorney if you can find one whom you can afford (many might even offer payment plans).  This is especially true if you wish to tackle both divorce and custody/visitation in the same lawsuit.  Otherwise you should contact the District Court in ### County and see if the clerks there offer self-help filing packets for pro se litigants.  Also keep in mind the ### Family Law Clinic which sometimes offers not only free legal advice on custody and other family matters but also a "###" packet (usually for around $### $25).  Read more about it here:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/###/I hope this helpful to at least point you in the right direction.

So I'm curious if there is any laws that are out there in order to protect my daughter from being around a person who Not only was found neglectful but actually doesn't have any want or will to be around that child43783.6534722222 Good evening, and a blessed Thanksgiving to you, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  The first thing you and your wife should consider doing is executing a Separation and Property Settlement Agreement, if you decide that divorce is in your near future (after one year separation of course, per North Carolina statute).  The agreement should be drafted and vetted by legal counsel, and signed by both parties in the presence of a notary public, judge, magistrate or courthouse clerk.  The issues resolved in the agreement as to the terms of separation, and the division of property between the spouses, are normally considered final, and while child custody arrangements covered in the agreement are also given ### by the courts, they are not as ironclad since the North Carolina District Court Division of each county always gets the last say in how custody and visitation shall be handled, in order to protect the ### best interests at all times.  But if there is agreement between the two sides about custody and visitation, by all means have provisions concerning that included in the drafts prepared by legal counsel.If you and your wife cannot amicably work through these issues together in negotiation between yourselves or through legal counsel on both sides, and you do not trust your wife to act in good faith, you need to speak with a local family law attorney about filing an action for custody.  Legal representation is not required, but it is strongly recommended if you hope to navigate the legal system effectively, and procure desirable results for yourself and your children.  If, however, retaining counsel is not financially viable, you should call or visit the New ### County Courthouse and ask whether the clerks in the family court section offer self-help packets for pro se litigants.  You can also contact the ### Family Law Clinic in ### and ask for a little time by phone to answer your preliminary questions, and for their ###" packet which I believe they offer for about $### $25 last time I checked.

She asked me today if i would fight her if she tried to do so.  what is the legality of this situation and how to i get in front of it?  I need to be ###, and not reactive in this situation, I feel.43783.71875 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  If your husband owns the property solely in his name, or owns it jointly with just his mother, this would most likely be considered separate property" for purposes of divorce and equitable distribution.  The same presumption would apply if the mother gifted or bequeathed the property to her son without mention of you in the deed or will; North Carolina law presumes that a gift or bequest from a parent to a child is solely to that child regardless of the child's marital status.  So it is not only the loan that is important to consider here but also (and more importantly) the deed itself.  If there is no mention of you in the deed it is not ###00% guaranteed but is highly probable that the District Court judge would consider this to be separate property of your husband in any dispute between you two in divorce proceedings.One exception to the above explanation that I can think of is if you can show the court that you expended significant time and resources to increase the property's ### in benefit to the entire household; if that could be proven with compelling evidence you might be entitled to certain monetary concessions from your husband although I doubt that you would get the property or a share thereof outright.  What is more likely is that you would get at least a 50% cut of the property's income if it is in fact generating income.  But that is an educated guess on my part and not a guarantee.You have two ways to secure certain outcomes with respect to property that clearly is or might be adjudicated later to be marital property: (###) a separation agreement between you and your husband that also includes settlement of property division issues; or (###) a motion for equitable distribution once the divorce has already been filed.  These would be the two main ways to resolve these issues although I can say from experience that the spouses addressing these issues on their own without the court in a comprehensive separation and property settlement agreement is far better.  The latter gives the parties more control over the process instead of relying on a judge (no matter how qualified and well ###) to call the shots.  If you and your husband decide to pursue the separation agreement route be sure to have the benefit of legal counsel since it is a powerful legally binding document once it is signed and notarized by both parties.  Definitely do not attempt to do this by yourself.These are my general thoughts after reading your question.  I hope that you and your husband can preemptively work through as many issues as possible as that will make the divorce process much easier once legal separation has actually begun.  For further guidance consult with a local family law attorney for ### affordable fee (or no fee at all although that is unlikely for a high-quality attorney) and also call the local courthouse and see if the family court section of District Court offers self-help filing packets for pro se litigants.  Finally reach out to the ### Family Law Clinic for both free guidance and a relatively cheap ($### $###5 the last time I checked) "###" packet if custody issues are in play.  See the ### website at the below link:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/###/Blessings to you and your family this winter and Thanksgiving."43784.0513888889 I have not yet filed for my divorce. My husband's name is on the loan to his mothers property. This is in his name which I am guessing makes it his property. The house is supposed to be up for sale right now or in some process of selling it. My question is can I claim a part of the house? Being that my husband technically is an owner. Do I have a piece of ownership in the process?Also if so, should I do something to make my claim before the house is sold?

Under ###Either spouse was mentally incompetent"More closely related than first cousinsSpouse believed the other was pregnant you separated within ### and no child was born within ###ImpotenceEither spouse was already married.The alternative is to pursue a divorce in North Carolina. Divorce in North Carolina requires you have been separated for not less than a year and a day (this has been interpreted as you have been living in different homes and that at least one of you intended that the separation be permanent during that time). Either you or your spouse must currently live in North Carolina and must have lived in the state for at least six months before the divorce. However your spouse does not need to agree to the divorce (must however be notified of the divorce case). I've included below the link to a packet prepared by the North Carolina court system for divorces (sort of a how-to guide to provide basic education on the process in North Carolina).  As the website notes the packet is designed to help you but is not a complete guide to North Carolina divorces.  The packet is designed for use in a "simple divorce" where you are not interested in ever receiving alimony or spousal support and you are not interested in ever having property or debts from the marriage divided between you and your spouse.  If you are able to you should talk with a lawyer to fully discuss the process and to make sure all of your rights are protected in the process.  As noted at the link there is a North Carolina Lawyer Referral Service and if needed possible advise or assistance from Legal Aid of North Carolina.  ###Prior to a divorce (given the one year wait time on a divorce in North Carolina) spouses may often reach a separation agreement.  The marriage is not formally dissolved but it is an agreement/contract between the separated spouses as to certain issues such as property bank accounts living arrangements or child custody. It appears from your description that such a separation agreement may not be necessary (you can be separated without having a formal separation agreement).  However if you believe that a formal separation agreement would be useful (in particular given the false pretenses and rehab issues) you could pursue that option. If however your spouse will not cooperate in getting a separation agreement North Carolina does have the option of a "Divorce from Bed and Board".  This is not an actual divorce but a court-ordered separation in instances where you can prove certain events such as alcohol or drug abuse.  If you do have any property issues you can ask the court to settle those issues.  I would strongly suggest discussing with a local attorney the possible benefits of some form of separation agreement while you wait the required year for a divorce. Thank you and have a pleasant Thanksgiving. "43796.8854166667 Hello, I got married ###th of this year.

Please and thank you. 43784.7388888889 Hi ###,You are not required to have a lawyer to file in North Carolina courts.Post-separation support is guided by NC ### Stat Â§ ###.  To move for post-separation support, a party must file with the court either a verified pleading, verified motion, or affidavit that sets forth the factual basis for the relief requested.What the court is going to look for in considering whether to award post-separation support is: the financial needs of the parties, the parties' accustomed standard of living, the present employment income and other recurring earnings of each party from any source, their ### abilities, the separate and marital debt service obligations, those expenses reasonably necessary to support each of the parties, and each party's respective legal obligations to support any other persons.The court will award post-separation support if it finds that the resources of the dependent spouse are not adequate to meet his or her reasonable needs and the supporting spouse has the ability to pay.Attached to this message is a model affidavit that shows you what information you will need to fill out. Unfortunately the district for Person County, District 9, does not have their own form. But, you should be able to use this and fill in the heading so it reflects the correct county and district. Once you have completed the form and gotten it notarized, bring it to the clerk of court in the Person county courthouse located at ###, ###, NC ###  and tell them this is an application for post-separation support.Best of luck.43817.8847222222 Hi, i would like to know if i can file for post separation support without having a lawyer?

He then text me while i was on my way back to North Carolina from Florida and said that he was leaving and wouldnt be back. That was the last we heard from him. Electric is going to be cut off and rent is coming up. Also the vehicle i drive is in his name since i am unemployed. I am very worried hes going to take it in the middle of the night. I have no money for a lawyer but i need post separation support or else my daughter and i are going to be on the streets sooner than later. Please help? I am pretty smart and know i can get the forms filled out. I just need to know if im allowed to file them myself and what forms i need to include. Thank you, ###43784.7993055556 Hello, Ms. ###:Thank you for this very important question.  This is heartbreaking given that these bad habits, once ###, can really ### your daughter's life for years to come, as I know you fully appreciate.  After reading your question, a couple things come to mind, which I will briefly share.First, note that because your daughter is seventeen, any troubleshooting strategies you might employ here will last, at most, for around one year.  Once your daughter turns eighteen, she will be free to associate freely with whomever she ### least in the eyes of the law, if not under the rules of your household.  So if your daughter is exceptionally strong willed or ###, your legal remedies will have limited effect, even if they do limit some of the negative exposure while she is still under the age of majority.Having said that, if you know for sure that the non-custodial mother is not only engaging in illegal drug use, but is ### the same behavior in a minor child, you should report this immediately to law enforcement, as both are crimes.  This will cost you nothing financially for the police to investigate and, if appropriate, charge the non-custodial mother as the investigation reveals is appropriate.Second, if you and/or your current partner (if there is one) have a custody order in place, and visitation by the non-custodial mother is part of that order, you could seek for the District Court judge to modify it based on a substantial change in the child's situation.  Custody/visitation orders can be modified only where there is a substantial change that affects the child's welfare and best interests.  If you can prove abuse, neglect, or participation in illegal activities that corrupt the child's ###, I believe a District Court judge would consider that serious enough to at least entertain changing the prior order to cut off visitation until your daughter's eighteenth birthday.Third, although this is a remote possibility, I do want to bring it up just in case you find it worth pursuing.  If the first two suggestions do not work, you might consider having yourself appointed as your daughter's guardian-ad-litem (or having someone already qualified to fill that role with the courts) to serve as your daughter's stand in and file for a protective order based on the non-custodial mother's conduct in the child's presence.  Honestly, I admit I am not sure how effective this option would be, since this would require some type of physical or serious emotional abuse, but I thought I would mention it nonetheless.I hope this helps somewhat.  Proceed with a good local family law attorney if you can find a reputable one you can afford.  Otherwise, ask the clerks in District Court whether they offer self-help filing packets for pro se litigants in custody/visitation matters.  Also consider contacting ### Family Law Clinic in ###, which sometimes offers free legal advice on ### relations matters, as well as a ###" packet for custody matters (usually for around $### $25).  See the link here:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/###/I hope this is helpful to you in some way.  God bless you and your family this Thanksgiving winter and ###."43797.1423611111 I have a ###. Her mother has bought her nicotine products, she has bought her a secret phone, she has been communicating with her in ways that are secretive on a DS.

Not to mention my ###.as well. 43785.5743055556 I'm not a tax expert so I cannot answer this question.  You need to speak with an accountant about this.  Good luck.  43787.8493055556 Ok...I just reread my answer and let me make corrections to the first big ### realized autocorrect and lots of ### might have made that paragraph unclear...(sorry about this):*****Were you married to your ex when your child was born or were you married to that person within ###â€™s birth? If yes, then your ex is â€œpresumptivelyâ€ your childâ€™s father, despite there being no acknowledgement or declaration of paternity and despite that your ex is not listed on your childâ€™s birth certificate.  If that man is *not* your childâ€™s father (even if the answer to the first question is yes) and you know that, then you ought to make that clear in your court pleadings and request a paternity test to prove it.  If your ex is actually your childâ€™s father, ### between unmarried parents, neither has more of a right to the children than the other... (rest of this paragraph the same as above). 43787.5930555556 Sorry first line should have been â€œwere you marriedâ€ (not â€œweâ€™reâ€).  :)43787.5881944444 There is no â€œeasyâ€ answer.  Weâ€™re you married to your childâ€™s father when your child was born or within ###?  If yes, then that man is â€œpresumptivelyâ€ your childâ€™s father, depicted there being no acknowledgement or declaration of paternity and the fact that he isnâ€™t listed on the birth certificate.  If that man is *not* your childâ€™s father, and you know that, then you ought to make that clear in your court pleadings and request a paternity test to prove it.  Generally, as between unmarried parents, neither parent has more of a right to the children than the other parent.  When a parent isnâ€™t on the birth certificate, it certainly does make it a bit harder to â€œproveâ€ that dad is â€œdadâ€ if questioned by authorities, doctors, school personnel, etc.  The fact that you also have a ###, and your ex is keeping both kids, probably makes it harder to go in and just get the ###.That said, until a court determines who has custody and when, you do have equal rights to your kids (and maybe exclusive rights to your ###-dad).  He shouldnâ€™t be able to â€œkeepâ€ them from you.  But also without a court order, it is hard to get the kids from the other parent when the parties donâ€™t agree on where the kids should be.  Often this results in parents â€œ###â€ the kids from the other while the kids are at school or in daycare.  Thatâ€™s generally not good for the kids and judges donâ€™t tend to like that behavior.  I strongly recommend you file a lawsuit for custody (if you havenâ€™t already) and ask for a paternity test to rule your ex out as the father of your younger child (if he is not the father).   If you feel that your kids are in danger (the law requires â€œsubstantial risk of physical injuryâ€) or if you think your ex is getting ready to flee North Carolina in order to avoid a court hearing on custody, then you may also be in a position to file for emergency custody.  I strongly recommend you consult with an attorney in your county who practices family law regularly to determine what the right course of action is in your case.

It sounds like most of the issues that spouses typically have to work out have largely been preempted by the fact that you own no marital home or significant other property as spouses, and because you have lived apart for so long.  Assuming that there are no custody or property division issues to be worked out, you can likely get a simple divorce by summary judgment, which would take about three months from the date you file your Complaint for Absolute Divorce (give or take a few weeks, depending on the court docket).  You can file in Guilford County, North Carolina, as long as (###) you have lived in North Carolina for at least six (6) months prior to filing for divorce, and (###) you have an address at which you can serve your husband with lawsuit papers.  As long as your husband will cooperate with you on accepting service, you can serve him through certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, and you will need to keep the ### return slip and file it with the court, along with an Affidavit of Service (notarized and sworn).  Once you have filed and served the initial complaint and summons successfully, just regular first-class mail will be sufficient.(If your husband will not be cooperative in accepting service, you will need to serve him either through the local sheriff's department in your husband's ### county of residence, or by process server.)Very, very few lawyers will take on a ### a simple summary judgment divorce like yours will hopefully ### free, as it will take between fifteen (###5) and thirty (30) hours, which at $### $###.  However, you should ask the family law section of the Guilford County District Court Division whether it offers self-help packets to pro se litigants in divorce matters (I know that the ### County Courthouse does where I live and practice, but your probably need something tailored to Guilford County, since local rules of District ### at ### also apply, in addition to the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure).  Also consider reaching out to North Carolina law school clinics, who might be able to provide you with short-term, limited guidance for free.  See the below links:### Family Law Clinic: http://law.###.edu/clinics/### Law Clinic (### Community Law Clinic): https://law.###.edu/advocate/clinical-programs/the-community-law-clinic/Best wishes to you in this matter, and have a blessed winter and Thanksgiving.43788.1333333333 I am needing assistance with getting a divorce.

I believe there are strong grounds for custody to be removed from both parents, but quite frankly, this is going to require an experienced, seasoned family law attorney who is well known and respected by the district court judges in ### County who might hear this case (all such cases are heard only in District Court, as you may already be aware).  Your main difficulties will be both procedural and ###, because you will have to formally ### the parents of the custody lawsuit, despite their both being at different physical locations due to their unstable life situations, and substantive, because any time you are seeking for a court to terminate parental rights, you must overcome the ### principle which presumes that under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, all biological parents are automatically benefited by the fundamental right to raise and have custody over one's own child.  This presumption can be ### by the court in certain instances, but it is a high burden to meet, and almost always requires proof of abuse, ###, serious neglect and/or abandonment, as well as conduct by the mother or father that is inconsistent with marital status."  While I am sure that you are well informed and resourceful and can handle some aspects of a legal proceeding on your own this is generally not something that a non-lawyer should do without counsel.  I strongly suggest doing an intensive search for local family law attorneys in and around ### County to assist you in this matter.  Hopefully you can find a few who can work with you on an affordable payment plan if money for upfront retainers is an immediate obstacle to legal engagement.God bless you for your noble efforts to try to save this young life.  May good health ### and prosperity come to you this winter and in ###."43797.8458333333 I am currently raising my Great Niece. I have had her full time since she was ###; she is now ###. When the baby was a week old, there was a domestic dispute, the father held a gun to the mother head, shot the gun through the house with the infant in the home and actually shot his father foot. Cops were called and at that time the mother was given an option to either leave with the police and go to the ### shelter or risk DSS being involved. She chose to got o the shelter. While in the shelter, she would leave the newborn with anyone at the shelter, who would babysit for her. At that time, I was working at ### DSS, she came by my office after a few days of being in the shelter, she asked me if I wanted to keep the baby over the upcoming weekend and I said yes. On that Friday, I was when I went to meet the mother to get the baby, she had no clothes, diapers, wipes or bottles for the baby. She had a container of formula and that was all. On Sunday, I asked the Mother if she would let the baby stay with me permanently until she could figure out where she was going and what she was going to do post shelter. She saw the baby a few times after that but only a couple of times. She would see that bay on, what I call, accidental visits, where we would, not intentionally, be at the same place, like my mothers (her grandmother), who is raising her oldest child (###). The father hasn't been in contact since the incident and is all of the time in trouble or hiding from the law. I live in a small county where everyone knows everyone and I also, now, work for the county DSS. It is going on a full year since the mother has visited with the child. My question is, at what point do I have legal grounds to file for full custody of the child and have a decent leg to stand on? I want to eventually adopt the child.   43787.7215277778 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and I am very sorry that you and your children have to deal with this situation.  I believe that it is at least ### under the facts you stated that you could gain full custody of your children if you petitioned the ### County District Court for such an award.  It would work much better for you if you have an experienced family law attorney who is accustomed to appearing in front of the ### County judges who hear custody cases, however; that will greatly increase your odds of being awarded sole custody.  I would first contact several local family law attorneys in and around ###ia to see who you can afford, and who would likely do a very good job for you and your kids.If for some reason legal fees are not workable at this point, I suggest a few courses of action.  First, contact the family law court in the District Court Division and ask if they offer self-help filing packets for pro se litigants.  Second, consider contacting the ### Family Law Clinic for free advice and (for about $### $25) a ###" custody packet.  See the information at the link below:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/###/Lastly I would supplement whatever advice you get from ### with an inquiry with the Wake Forest University School of Law Child Advocacy Clinic information for which can be found at this link:###/Filing and pursuing your own custody action without counsel is doable if it is strictly necessary but it would require a lot of reading on your ### the NC Rules of Civil Procedure (see link below) and of the local rules of the ### County District Court for family law cases (find them at ###).###Reading ### North Carolina Family Law would also be an immense help to you; you might find a copy of the ### treatise at one of the branches of the ### County Public Library (check its online catalog); otherwise you would need to find an edition at a courthouse library or at one of the local law firms.  You could also order an edition for yourself but it would be expensive unless you found a used copy on ###.Generally speaking the "### presumption" (named after a NC case in which ### was one of the parties) says that a biological parent is entitled under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to the fundamental right of raising and caring for his/her own children.  This is a very high standard to overcome since it includes constitutional implications but that legal presumption can be overcome if the parent is proven in court to be manifestly unfit to be a custodial parent.  Cases where this happens generally include instances of abuse or neglect or such serious conduct by the unfit parent that the judge finds to be totally inconsistent with a parent's role in a minor child's life.  There are many instances in which the judge may not like what a parent does from a personal moral perspective but divesting a biological parent of his/her constitutional rights to custodial parenthood would require something far more than that.  While the judge has broad discretion as to whether the facts of your case merit such divestment I do believe that the factors you mentioned are serious enough to go forward with a custody trial in District Court.  It is now a question of whether you can effectively do this by yourself or whether you can arrange for family law counsel to be retained to get the best results by the most efficient means.Blessings to you and your children.

Do I have a solid case to file petition to take his rights away. 43788.5986111111 Good morning, ###:I hope life is going well for you this winter.  Yes, if the case has been dismissed, it should be removed from the calendar call on the appointed day that it would have otherwise been called by the judge, and there is no reason for you to show up in court that day.  However, please be certain that the case is actually dismissed, because if for some reason there was a miscommunication about this and the case is called, a judge could issue a contempt citation against you, despite your best intentions about believing that there was no longer a court date for that case.  But if that is all confirmed, you are correct in thinking that your obligation to show up ends.Have a very blessed Thanksgiving, winter and ###.43788.7256944444 Hello,I received a subpoenaed as a witness and now the case has been dismissed due to me talking to DA and the issue has resolved on its own. Do I still need to go to court?

Looking at this from an ethical lawyer's point of view, I think it would be a conflict of interest if the judge previously represented your opposing party in a litigation matter.  The proper way to address this is to raise this issue at the next hearing in front of that judge, and ask the judge to recuse himself based on the presumed conflict.  It would then be up to the judge as to whether to do so, but if the judge wanted to avoid any further conflict over this, it would be in his best interests to not hear any other motions or other matters in this case.  I agree with your thinking on this.I hope this will work.Best wishes to you this winter and Thanksgiving holiday.43789.0944444444 It would be very difficult to correct this after the fact.  You would probably need to hire a local family law attorney from near or around ### County to see if anything post-judgment can be done.  If an actual judgment has been entered, you may be entitled to post-judgment relief under Rule ### (I do not think a motion for reconsideration under Rule ###, but you could ask a local attorney about this in order to get a more definite opinion than I can provide, not being aware of all that has happened in the case).  A ### consultation with a family law attorney would clear this up and provide you a definite roadmap for challenging this, assuming viable legal options do exist.  That is the best I can think of based on what I know from reading your postings here.Best wishes, again.43789.1048611111 Ok so I have a custody case that has been heard a few tImes by the same judge.

I have been looking through the NC divorce packet."   We own our home- ### $65### $40###.   We have one child and my husband is self-employed and I make $###.  I thought it would be best for my husband's self-employment tax obligation to wait to formally divorce in ###-payed any self-employment tax and relies on the earned income credit as head of household. I will be the head of household after the divorce as the primary caregiver.  Should we file an equitable division of marital debts first before filing for divorce? "43791.0090277778 Good afternoon,If I understand the facts correctly, you married and then immediately separated for the last ###, and subsequently married a different individual in ###.   If you never received any paperwork or had any legal interaction after the marriage, it is unlikely the ###. However, it is possible, if she was unable to locate you and serve you with papers, and then notice was provided through publication, that she was unilaterally granted a divorce decree.  If you knew where she would have filed for divorce, you could potentially search the records of that jurisdiction for any divorce judgment. Other jurisdictions (other than North Carolina) may have easier or harder divorce rules that could have made this more or less likely. Simply being separated does not generally dissolve the marriage.  Assuming a divorce or annulment was never granted, you can pursue either an annulment or a divorce.  In North Carolina, the annulment options are limited.  Generally, North Carolina courts will only grant annulments for the following reasons:Under ###Either spouse was mentally incompetent"More closely related than first cousinsYou believed she was pregnant you separated within ### and no child was born within ###ImpotenceEither spouse was already marriedJust a note - a wedding where one spouse is already married can be considered automatically void in North Carolina. If one of the above items describes your situation you may be able to receive an annulment of that first marriage in North Carolina.If one of the above items does not describe your situation you will likely need to pursue a divorce.  Divorce in North Carolina can be done simply if the matter is uncontested and there are no children or assets involved (which would be the case here). The only requirements are that you have been separated one year and you (or her) have been a resident of North Carolina for six months prior to the divorce filing. The other person does not need to consent but does have to be notified. Generally speaking and this varies from county to county in North Carolina you will file paperwork (the claim) with the court in your county and have the divorce summons served on your spouse (this is done by the county sheriffs in North Carolina). Ultimately if your spouse refuses to respond or acknowledge the paperwork you can be granted the divorce.  You may or may not need to go in front of the court; again that will vary by county in North Carolina.  In any event I would strongly suggest that you speak with a family law attorney in your area.  Regardless of whether the annulment or divorce routes are available there very possibly could be an impact on your subsequent ###.  As indicated above in North Carolina a subsequent marriage by an already married person may be automatically void.  This could have impacts on estate planning inheritance medical authorizations and ###.  Again I would highly recommend you consult a family law attorney to work through these issues.  There may turn out to be no issues but the potential should be examined. I've pasted below the link to the North Carolina court system page for divorce and settlement cases: ###.  This includes helpful ### of the process for divorce and links to model forms if you elect to pursue without a lawyer.  Thank you.

I hope ### can help out.  He's the ### standard as a ###.43793.1618055556 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  This is heartbreaking; no child deserves to be hit and verbally abused in this way.  I believe you have grounds to seek sole custody.  There is a very high standard to meet in order to succeed in such a manner, since the right of a biological parent to care for and raise his/her own child is considered a constitutionally protected fundamental right under the ruling precedents of both the U.S. and NC Supreme Court.  In North Carolina specifically, this is known as the ### ### and it is a strong legal presumption to overcome.  Instances that could persuade a ### County District Court judge to override the ### presumption would be instances of abuse, neglect, or other serious misconduct that is totally inconsistent with parental status.  Physical, sexual or serious emotional abuse would likely qualify in the eyes of many North Carolina district court judges, although I do not know the ### County judges very well, and cannot really predict what any judge will do once the evidence and testimony is offered in court.Since a child at twelve is old enough to comprehend the seriousness of taking an ### its duty to tell the ### is more likely than not that the judge would want to hear from your daughter on the witness stand, as well as from you and any other qualified fact witnesses with direct knowledge of the substance of this matter.  The judge would then weigh all the ### any that the father might wish to ### make a decision based on what the judge believes is in the best interests of the child."So yes I would institute a custody action if none is pending and if there is already an order signed by the court you may need to file for a modification of the order based on a "material change in circumstances" that affect your child's safety and well being.  An order can be modified but good cause has to be shown that the circumstances of the child's life truly have changed in a serious way.Reach out to ### ### at The ### Historic House Hotel at ### (you can just stop by if you happen to be in downtown ### City) or call him at ###-###.  See if he might be able to help you on some kind of payment plan that is affordable.  At the very least he might be able for a modest consultation fee to give you some guidance on how to proceed even if you two decide that you will otherwise proceed as pro se in the litigation.God bless you and your daughter this winter Thanksgiving and ###."43792.1 It's unique and complicated.  My daughter is ###.  Her father and I are divorced, and she lives with me in North Carolina and visits him usually in the winter and summer.

I've filed our custody paperwork here in North Carolina, and part of it states that when she's twelve, she can choose where she wants to continue living and with which parent.  So my main question is do I need to go through a legal process with custody all over again to make it where she is not required to see him at all, or is she legally old enough to make a statement herself at this time?43791.8458333333 Thank you so much for your ### response. Itâ€™s greatly appreciated! Iâ€™ll contact him on Monday morning and see what can be done further.43792.1048611111 Good afternoon, Ms. ### (through Ms. ### ###):Thank you for your question.  While you and your child should retain a New ### family law attorney in the local county where your former husband filed his motion to modify his alimony payments, I will offer some general things to consider that are likely to prove helpful, and which are probably applicable in any state, although I make no warranties about New ### law.Most states will allow subsequent hearings for modifications of alimony payments based on genuine, substantial changes in ### circumstances.  However, the party who is dependent upon the alimony has an equal right to oppose the motion, and if there is evidence to show that the opposing party is falsifying income figures or other information in order to artificially ### earnings (and therefore alimony payments), that evidence should by all means be introduced.  With you living in North Carolina and this matter still under the jurisdiction of New ###'s family law courts, it will be difficult to successfully oppose this motion for modification without good family law counsel in New ###.  ### Find a Lawyer" feature is a very helpful tool so I would start there in your search.  Beyond that please be aware that the judge in New ### will have broad discretion to consider all evidence relating to your ex-husband's financial situation and your own personal situation and continued reliance upon the alimony payments as supplemental income to consider whether it is appropriate to modify.  Ultimately this will be the judge's call based on the facts evidence and sworn testimony presented.Blessings to you your son and ### this winter and Thanksgiving holiday."43792.8215277778 My name is ### ###.

I'll try to give you a general overview of what you're currently going through with DSS and I hope this helps.If DSS believes that children are in danger in their current living environment, DSS has the power to remove children from their parent or ### care.  DSS can assume â€œtemporary custodyâ€ of children without notice, hearing, or even a court order. Temporary custody should only be used briefly when it is necessary to protect a child while a petition is filed and a court order for ### custody is being sought. The only way DSS can assume temporary custody of a child if there are reasonable grounds to believe that (###) the child is abused, neglected, or dependent and (###) the child would be injured or could not be taken into custody if it were first necessary to obtain a court order. A child cannot be held for more than ###, or ###, Sunday, or holiday unless a petition has been filed and a court order for ### custody has been issued.The  DSS will apply for a â€œ### custody orderâ€ to temporarily remove the child from his or her home. As a parent, you are not present when DSS initially requests that a judge grant a ### custody order. The Judge only relies on the allegations presented by DSS. Before entering a ### custody order, the judge must make certain findings. The judge must find that (###) DSS has filed a petition in which the child is alleged to be abused, neglected or dependent; (###) there is a â€œreasonable factual basisâ€ to believe that the allegations in the petition are true; and (###) the child has suffered an injury or sexual abuse, exposed to a substantial risk of physical injury or sexual abuse because the parent or caretaker has created those circumstances; the child was abandoned; or the child is in need of medical treatment to either cure or alleviate suffering from a serious medical condition.If a ### custody order is issued, you will need to go in front of a judge to explain why your child should be returned. Pursuant to North Carolina law, this hearing must take place within seven days. If the Judge continues the order, you will need to come back for further hearings to continue to evaluate as to whether the child should remain in ### custody. At each hearing, DSS must show the Judge that the it is necessary for the child to remain out of his or her parentsâ€™ or ### care. As a parent, you are permitted to present evidence and provide testimony as to why there is no longer a need for the child to be out of your care. The court is also required to consider whether there is a family member who would be both appropriate and willing to assume the care of the children until the next ### custody hearing.Best of luck.43819.7090277778 I will try to be as brief as possible. My kids were with my ex, her brother overdosed on heroin. She claims she nor the kids were present during the overdose, dss says otherwise. We do have an extensive record with dss, mostly die to calls on the mother (my ex) for drug use. She has been in a clinic lately so I've allowed time with the children. They took the kids from her and said they were returning them to me. I went to pick them up, they told me mo based on the fact that they had a ### (no court order), I asked for them back right then or after the ###. Instead they sent them to a foster home, until the next day after the ###, and filed a non secure motion with the court. Was this initial ###? If not can I do anything about this in court? Thank you43794.7361111111 Good Afternoon,I'm writing this message full of doubts and concerns and in search of some professional feedback on my situation. Last Thursday I was visited by ### because of a report of supposed child ### and violent behavior against my family. The social worker of ### went to visit the school where my son goes and interviewed both my child and partner(We live together but we are not married). My partner tells me she spoke about some problems we are having with her psychiatrist but she never told her I was violent but she did not have a ### so I'm not sure exactly what she said. I was not given any options I was told I was rising the voice to my partner and my child and other things which all are not the truth. I was told to accept a parent safety agreement plan and that they would be ### my child again and my partner and the school teacher, checking with ###.Do I need to be concern with being asked to leave the house or stop seeing my child? Will this incident follow me trough the rest of my life even though I did not do what is being said?Thanks43794.8236111111 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question; your concerns as expressed here are totally understandable.  It sounds like right now that there is a normal, standard investigation based on a third-party complaint (whether filed based on good faith or not) that abuse took place.  Even if the complaint is not true, there usually is at least a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether there is any real credible evidence that child abuse took place.  If no credible evidence that ### the ### allegations surfaces, you are unlikely to be charged with any crime, nor are you likely to be sued to remove your custody rights.  If, however, you are charged, you will need to retain a criminal defense lawyer (or apply for court-appointed counsel if you cannot afford your own lawyer), and if you are sued for custody, you will need to hire a family law attorney.  If you and/or the mother speak Spanish as your primary language, you have the right to have a ### interpreter in the court proceeding to help you through the steps.In the meantime, if there is any local lawyer who handles child custody cases (usually a family law attorney), and who also speaks Spanish, I would meet with such person for a consultation, which is normally a lot cheaper than retaining legal counsel for the long ###.  Hopefully an in-person discussion with a ### lawyer who can inquire of the investigator's report can clarify whether there were translation issues that might have unfairly painted you in a negative light.That is as best I can advise based on what your posting says.  It appears that this situation will be a fluid one while the investigation is still pending.  I am glad that you got to present your side of the story during DHHS' visit.Best wishes to you, and I hope that fairness and truth prevail in this serious matter.43794.8361111111 Suing is not a viable option unless you can prove the falsification of the investigative narrative was grossly negligent, malicious, intentional or reckless.  The key areas of concern at present are to get the transcript reviewed by a lawyer on your side, get the facts out, and defend yourself against any false accusations.  Not all investigations of this kind result in charges or lawsuits against the accused, but since the complaint involves a minor child, the authorities have to investigate it, just to be sure the child's interest are protected.  If the accusations truly are groundless, hopefully the investigation will ultimately reveal that, and the truth will come out.43794.8652777778 Taking into consideration the language barrier, if the psychiatrist proceeded with a DHHS report without providing a ### for a patient with limited English fluency can the practitioner be sued for all the consequences me and my family will have of all this situation?Thanks43794.8611111111 Good evening, and a very blessed Thanksgiving to you, Ms. ###:Thank you for this very important question.  First, I thank you for the love, support and stability you have provided your granddaughter.  I myself am the beneficiary of my own grandmother's early attention and support, and it made an ### difference in my and my brother's life.  Thank you for that.If the biological mother is firm in her intent to move to Texas in ###, the law begins with the presumption that she and the father are fit to take their daughter wherever they elect to live.  This is true even if one or both parents is less mature or positive an influence than you are, or less than the ideal parent at all.  If the daughter is very upset at the prospect of living in Texas with her mother, one of two things must happen: either you and the parents need to reach a private agreement whereby the daughter remains with you in North Carolina (although please understand that the parents' desires will ultimately prevail in this situation, should a conflict ever arise, unless a court says otherwise), or you need to bring a custody proceeding in ### County District Court, in which you are the plaintiff and the parents are the defendants.  Even if there is broad agreement as to the child staying with you, there will be no legal effect to that agreement unless it is officially ### by court order, or by consent decree approved by a ### County District Court judge, which would then have the same legal, binding effect of a court order.  If there is an actual dispute in court, by which the mother or father do not wish to relinquish custody, there will be little that you as a grandparent can do, unless there is compelling evidence shown at trial to show that the parents are manifestly unfit to have their own children.  This would require proof of abuse, ###, neglect or abandonment, or other serious misconduct inconsistent with parental status."  So if the parents do not wish for you to have custody approved by the court the biological parent will usually win absent exceptional circumstances as briefly referenced above.Generally speaking grandparents under North Carolina law do have legal standing to sue for custody of their grandchildren if they allege (and prove) that the parent is unfit or if there is neglect or abuse.I recommend if at all possible that you retain a ### or ### County (they are part of the same judicial district so attorneys and judges in one county typically know many of the others from the other; I grew up on the ###-### border along the ### River and know many on both sides) family law attorney for the best results.

If you need a family law attorney for limited representation on preparing your paperwork for your response to the ex parte motion or order, I would search locally in the county where the custody matter is pending and see if you can pay a reduced rate for a set period of hours in helping you go over everything you need to file, and ensuring its correctness so that when you file, you know it is done right the first time.  I suspect that this consultation and document review will take either ###, for your time and financial planning purposes.If you have not already, consider using ### Find a Lawyer" feature; it is free and can help you ### find a number of local family law attorneys in the relevant county each one of whom will have an Avvo page that allows you to quickly scan for credentials background years of experience client reviews peer endorsements and in some cases even fee schedules.  This is probably the easiest and most efficient way to search for ### for this limited purpose.This website by contrast will not get you very far in terms of verifying accuracy of documents to file since it is designed for relatively short answers to questions where the client is interested in general information and a point in the right direction.  ### Q&A forum is similar in that regard but the "Find a Lawyer" feature helps you find specific counselors at law with whom to work.In the alternative you can contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association or one of the local county bar associations in your area for referral sources.

You can inquire locally at the courthouse in the ### county where you live to see if they offer self-help divorce filing packets, which might make things a little easier for you.  Even if there is broad consent to terms and a separation and property settlement agreement executed, there is still the question of navigating all the procedural rules of the court system, which can be a little ### even to newly licensed lawyers.

The only efficient and effective way to resolve this is for you to retain an experienced, local family law attorney to file a child support action and use the legal process to compel testimony and/or court-supervised DNA analysis to confirm paternity one way or another.  Even if you believe that you cannot afford counsel for the long ###, I would at least have a consultation with a reputable Cumberland County attorney whom you find online or by other means (consider using ### Find a Lawyer" feature as well as contacting the Cumberland County Bar and Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association) and planning your strategy during that initial meeting.  The case will be a lot easier to handle if you have legal representation but if that is not financially possible having a firm strategy about compelling follow-up analysis of the paternity issue will still be highly useful in getting to the end you desire.I think you will likely win this but it might take a little compulsion from the court given that the father is not being cooperative.I hope this ends well for you and your child.

YES, absolutely, it is entirely appropriate when you feel the need for reassurance, to hire a family law attorney on a limited basis to review a separation agreement and provide detailed feedback.  Doing this would probably entail confirming engagement with the attorney, then emailing a copy of the agreement (or mailing it if you prefer), and having the attorney meet with you in person, or consult by phone, after the chance of reading it.  Most seasoned family law attorneys are able to do this in just ###-###, and whether you add another hour just to talk about the document is something you and counsel should work out as part of your agreement.  I think this would cost just a couple or few hundred dollars at most.I strongly recommend ### W. ### of ###, at the law firm of ### & Van Hoy, LLP, if you do not mind working with a ### County attorney.  ### has been practicing family law since the ###980s, and is VERY pro-women and children; in fact, when my single mother was raising me in ###, one of the reasons I was well taken care of in terms of child support was that my mother could count on ### to fight hard.

I do not know whether or how much ### charges for consultations, but it is worth asking just to see.  Long-term representation for a family law matter like this would almost never be done on a pro bono basis, so I doubt that any lawyer would be willing to sign up for a case like this at no cost (most of us cannot stay in business if we did).  Perhaps a preliminary discussion with ### can at least get you started, even if you have to attend hearings later down the road by yourself.  Also, check with Wake Forest University School of Law Child Advocacy Clinic and see if they would help; if so, it would be free of cost.  The law students there work on child-related cases in ### County under the supervision of a law professor who is also a licensed practicing attorney.

Is there anyway to find a pro bono lawyer or would the attorney in ### be willing to do a free consultation?  I will reach out to her personally, but my finances are extremely limited.  My daughter is getting braces ### and my ex will withhold my child support to cover my half ( if past experiences are an indication of his actions).  Actually, I donâ€™t know what he will do since he refuses to communicate with me or discuss anything with me.  I appreciate any and all feedback.  Thanks for your time and assistance.43802.46875 ###,Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any templates for a Response to Custody Complaint.  I encourage you to look at this website, http://www.legalaidnc.org/get-help/self-help-clinics/child-custody-and-visitation, and sign up for a LegalAid clinic, the next one being held this coming Tuesday, ###th.  There are various locations, but unfortunately ### is not available.  Any location you could get to would be sufficient, as the county is not important for the clinics.  At the clinic, they can help you prepare a response to the custody complaint.  You absolutely want to file a response, even if it is a written letter objecting to the complaint.  HOWEVER, please know that in North Carolina, custody mediation is MANDATORY.  Meaning you have to go.  If you fail to attend the orientation and mediation, it won't look good for you at a custody hearing.  The mediator will help work through the custody arrangement with both of you for free.  The mediator is trained and a specialist, and will hopefully assist you and your ex in coming up with a good arrangement.  If you are able to agree, the mediator prepares the order and will send you each a copy to review.  Once reviewed, and you have signed and returned, the mediator takes care of having a judge sign and enter the order.  Then it's done.  If you are unable to agree at mediation, then your ex will be responsible for noticing a hearing date for the custody hearing.  A custody order is actually a good thing, as it sets real boundaries for both of you and helps protect your daughter from messing with her routine.  Good luck!### ### ###### Banks Legal Services, Inc.43805.8493055556 Is there a template to answer a civil summons for child mediation? I was served and I have my child ###, but the dad and I are not agreeing on schedules right now. He filed paperwork and I wanted to see an example of a response. Mediation orientation is tomorrow and I wanted file my answer with the clerk since I will be at the courthouse. My daughter is ### (her dad) and I are attempting to co-parent her. We both work full time jobs and she is in daycare during the day. I received the NC voucher for reduced daycare (that is the â€œchild supportâ€-$###, I also pay $###, both are paid directly to daycare center). He had a set schedule with his first part time job and we worked around this for several months. I had her ### and he had her ### AM. He recently told me about a new part time he started that is a floating position in between different stores. His plan was to keep the schedule and drop my daughter off with whomever was available and then get off work and get her ready for bed. To ease a transition for her, I suggested the same or similar schedule he has with his son (not by me), which is m-f with his mom and his dad Sat and Sun. He refused this by telling me it wasnâ€™t enough time with her to then texting me and suggesting some wednesdays (he doesnt know his 2nd part time schedule until fridays he told me) and he also wants every other weekend. He also then told me he would go establish paternity and go to mediation to secure the schedule he wanted. I reminded him that a consistent schedule for her is what is important. Again, my daughter is two and my job and her home  life with me are stable. He is currently working ###. 43803.0701388889 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Mere length of separation is not, by itself, sufficient to establish a divorce under North Carolina law.  When divorcing in North Carolina based on separation of one year (###% of all divorces, in all likelihood), the following must be established: (###) physical separation of one year (with cessation of regular marital relations); and (###) at least one spouse having lived continuously in North Carolina for at least six months as of the date of filing for divorce in this state.  Yes, you must actually go through a divorce lawsuit, and you are not divorced" until a North Carolina District Court judge signs a sealed Decree of Absolute Divorce.  Depending on how complex the divorce is it can be done in as little as three to four months or up to a year (I do not know of many divorces that took longer than a year although that does occasionally happen in situations where the parties are especially ###).  One cannot "get a divorce without the other knowing because it is required that the opposing party serve papers at all stages of the divorce, from the initial complaint and summons, all the way to the Decree of Absolute Divorce, and all the steps in between (of which there are several).If this is your situation that is described in your post, I recommend consulting with or retaining a family law attorney in ###, ###, or nearby for precise legal guidance.  Blessing and best wishes to you this winter, and in ###0###0.43803.8256944444 If a couple has been separated for ### are they legally divorced? Or must one serve papers? Or can one get a divorce without the other knowing? 43803.7902777778 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Correct: you do need an experienced family law attorney to consult with and prepare a custody lawsuit, which will give you certain subpoena powers with respect to the likely father of your child, so that paternity can be conclusively determined.  This website is very good for obtaining brief general advice and legal information, but it is not a good one for actually finding attorneys, since attorneys are not allowed under state ethics rules to contact you first in order to recruit your business.  This is considered direct solicitation of a future client, and can get an attorney disciplined by the State Bar if s/he breaks this rule and is caught doing so.  Thus, you will need to make the first contact with a family law attorney, and seek a consultation about establishing paternity.I recommend several ### for ### searching for and locating the right attorney for your important needs.  Consider using ### Find a Lawyer" feature (it is free) and also contact the ### County Bar and/or Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association and let them know that you are looking for family law attorneys in ### to help you establish paternity through a District Court proceeding.  Hopefully you will find someone who can work with you on a retainer or payment plan that suits your budget as well as legal needs.I wish you much success as you wander this path and wish you prosperity good health and fulfillment this winter and in ###."43804.7097222222 I had a child during my separation and the biological father needs to be put on the birth certificate and also given his rights. The child is now ###â€™ve been divorced and even ruled out the ex husband with a dna test. Iâ€™ve contacted vital records with this information but they say I need an attorney. 43804.6958333333 My mother passed away in ### and she did not have a will filed.  I reside in NC and my brother is in NY.  My brother and I are the beneficiaries for her retirement and have submitted paperwork and received letters of testamentary identifying my brother as the executor of her estate in NY.  She owns a property in NY as well as one here in NC.  The NY property will be transferred into my brother's name and the NC property into my name.  Can the letter of testamentary from NY be used to transfer the NC property into my name or do we need to create another estate in NC and request a similar letter from NC?   43804.8666666667 This can be very confusing!  Each state has very different laws about estates, processing estates, and transferring real estate.  The way things generally work, is that after you have opened the estate in NY you open what is called an Ancillary Estate in NC in the county where the real estate is located. You would then essentially be handling two ### probate proceedings in two states for two different pieces of real property.  You run an ad for creditors and file all the various required papers here in NC as well as in NY.  In the end that allows you to have the land free and clear of creditors or other claimants.If your mother willed one piece to your brother and one to you, you are done, and there is no requirement for a ###d; the Will and/or the estate process conveys the land.  However, if your mother willed everything to the two of you equally, you need ###ds for each piece conveying from both of you (and any spouses there may be) to the one who you have agreed will get that particular piece.One more confusing thing that can make things easier, is that if you don't want to sell the NC land in the next two years, you can let time cut off the rights of creditors instead of running the ad to cut them off. Then you would proceed with a ###d if you need to get your brother's share and could hold the property as the proper owner.  I do not know the rules in NY and it may be very different there, so don't assume that the rules travel from state to state.I hope this helps.  This can be a lot to process.### ######43804.8833333333 Good evening, ###:Thank you so much for this helpful fact summary, and very worthwhile question.  Overall, you and your wife are fine.  First, children of deceased parents do not inherit a parent's debts after the latter dies; if the children were never parties to the contract from which an otherwise legitimate debt arose, the children cannot be held personally liable.  Even if we assume that your deceased mother-in-law did owe a legitimate debt to someone, that person cannot punish your wife for that, when she had nothing to do with it.  So if the boyfriend is foolish enough to sue on this, the lawsuit will get dismissed in the very earliest stages, without having to go through the entire proceeding.  You are safe based on those facts.You are also correct that bona fide creditors typically must submit a Notice of Claim in writing to the executor or administrator within ### (or it can be a shorter period as specified in the Notice to Creditors" in the newspapers if applicable).  The legal authority for this is N.C.G.S. Â§ ###8A-###9-3(a).  If the boyfriend wanted to be paid he should have submitted a letter or other form of written notice to the ### personal representative as contemplated by the statute.  (And I must add that even had he done so this debt would have likely been an eight (last) priority claim under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###8A-###9-6 so if the estate was not well funded to begin with it is unlikely he would have been paid anyway.)Finally I would say that the only way the boyfriend would have a right to sue the personal representative would be if he could prove that (###) he the boyfriend did submit a timely claim in writing and (###) despite his doing so the personal representative either negligently or intentionally failed to honor the claim based on the statutory priority assigned to it and the available funds or other property of the estate.  This could be interpreted as the personal representative's breach of fiduciary duty to the estate and there might be personal liability from that failure if the estate has already been closed.  However I seriously doubt that this is applicable here.In sum the boyfriend does not know what he is talking about and any foolish steps he makes toward suing will come to ### based on the facts that you wrote here.  While I know that anyone who seems to be serious in his litigation threats would be a cause for stress please do not worry too much.  Any lawyer whom he might contact about this is surely aware that this will go nowhere and if that is not the case and the lawsuit is dismissed because it is frivolous and totally without merit both the lawyer and the client who hired the lawyer to file the lawsuit might face sanctions and fines for reimbursement of your attorney's fees in having to respond to this nonsense.  Unless you have left out important facts of which I have no reason to be aware I see no way that you or your wife can be successfully sued.Blessings and best wishes to you and your wife this winter and in ###0###0--in health finances professional development marriage and self discovery."43805.1152777778 My wife's mother passed away in February. Her boyfriend told us after the estate was closed, that her mom owed him money. We never heard of this debt till after the estate was closed. He said he is going to sue us. The agreement, if there was one, was only between the mother and boyfriend. The was no signed document between the two of them. Does he have a case? This took place in North Carolina. We did inform of the attorney we got to handle the probate stuff when he asked us. But never told us why. We looked up the state law and it said something about if someone didn't file with in ### forever barred". We are nervous and would have difficulty affording an attorney. We haven't been served any papers. But his lawyer told the estate attorney we got that he had witnesses about the debt. Does he gave a case after the estate is closed and can he sue us for a proposed debt made by her other that we were not apart of? Thank you for your time."43805.0875 Thank you so much for being so quick to answer. So, if we are served we should find an attorney, and not be overly worried correct? We we have grounds to reasonably request reimbursement for legal fees and lost wages for missing time from our respective jobs? Again thank you for your quick reply. You have stopped alot of heartache and tears being ### in my home. Bless you and thank you so much.43805.1270833333 You are welcome.  You would not get lost wages" if you were sued but the lawyer who filed a worthless lawsuit would be subject to sanctions under Rule ### (which punishes lawyers for asserting claims or making motions based on (###) factual insufficiency (###) legal insufficiency and/or (###) improper purpose--the one most relevant here would be factor (###) based on the ### rule in the statute I cited above).  Additionally the party that wins in dismissing a lawsuit based on lack of merit (called "failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted") can make a motion for attorney's fees.  The judge still gets to decide whether to grant the motion but this is an option you would have as long as you are not in small claims court.  Again no well-educated lawyer would dare make a claim like this on behalf of a client so let's hope the boyfriend does not recruit a foolish or inexperienced lawyer.  The rest of us know better based on what I have written above.  Don't get too worked up about this."43805.13125 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  The honest answer is that while you will probably find North Carolina adoption lawyers who would be willing to do this for a reduced price (they are often ### lawyers, as you might expect given the subject area of law), I am almost certain you will not find one willing to do an adoption case for little or no cost.  The reason is that a ### one who entered adoption law by way of the related area of family ### had to invest significant time and intellectual resources to develop expertise in an area of law that very few lawyers practice.  There is a saying that, You do not owe me for the minutes or hours; you owe me for the years."  Because this is such a highly specialized area of law there is a commensurate cost that ### the expertise.  So the only honest way to answer your question (although I admit it is not as desirable as you would have liked) is that you will need to spend a little time searching for North Carolina adoption lawyers then compare and contrast to determine whether that lawyer will deliver the services you deserve and expect at a cost you and your husband can afford.  I highly recommend two sources: (###) ### "Find a Lawyer" feature which allows you to search for lawyers under both subject area ("Adoption") and geographical locale (### Chapel Hill ### Greensboro ### etc.).  For free you can get several profile pages to read in your free time and think through which profiles are most pleasing then contact the three or four on your ###.  Some lawyers will charge more than others and some will be more willing than others to consider offering you a discount if they can afford to do so on their business end.  (It is mostly a business decision for them and not because they are greedy or selfish.)Secondly (###) consider using the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association which can also purposefully direct you to good lawyers in adoption law.  I hope that your legal inquiry is fruitful and I hope that you and your husband will be rewarded a ### for your compassion and ### generosity of spirit.  For certain you both are to be commended for your willingness to do this.Blessings and best wishes to you both this winter and in ###0###0."43805.8409722222 I am reaching out to you with hopes of a little insight into an unforeseen circumstance in my life.

You cannot be kicked out of your own marital home when your name is on the deed, and you cannot be blocked access to any joint marital bank accounts.

So things are in flux until (###) you and your husband sign and enter into a valid separation and property settlement agreement, and/or (###) issues relating to separation and division of marital property are spelled out in definite terms by a District Court judge's order in a divorce proceeding.Please note that for purposes of starting the clock on the one-year separation required in North Carolina, sleeping in separate bedrooms, alone, will most likely not suffice in the eyes of the judge hearing your divorce case.  Separation is defined in the vast majority of divorce cases as (###) physical separation by living in separate residences, and (###) cessation of regular" marital relations (there is a very narrow exception for sporadic sexual encounters during separation but if it becomes "regular the law presumes that the spouses have in fact reconciled, and are no longer separated" in contemplation of a divorce after one year).Whenever you next can I would consult with a local family law attorney to help you negotiate a separation and property settlement agreement which is your first step in this process.  If you and your husband cannot come to agreement on terms of separation and division of marital property you will need to have these issues litigated in front of a ### County District Court judge in family court.God bless you and your family (especially the children) as you work through this challenging transition.  I wish you all the strength resources and peace of mind needed for you to make good decisions for your family's best interests and to better secure a stable and comfortable living situation for yourself going forward.

Yes, you need to attend your mediation, as it will not be able to be conducted unless both parents are present.  Typically child custody ### are free, so I am not sure why in this instance there is a charge; however, if there is a charge and the other spouse/parent is willing to pay it, that should make it easier for you in terms of logistics.  But yes, one way or the other, you need to attend.I hope that a fair and acceptable result occurs, both in the context of the mediation and the related court proceeding.

Usually it will be granted as long as you file within the initial 30-day window, but do it ahead of that just to be sure you can file your substantive response in case your request is not granted.  If there is no preferred form for the extension, I would contact the folks at ### Family Law Clinic and ask them if they can provide you a form template for (###) a Motion for Extension of Time and (###) a Certificate of Service to customize for your case.

If you are the defendant in this civil action, you need to prepare an Answer, so checking the ###" box would be appropriate.  Claims for relief are not relevant here unless you also plan to assert a counterclaim against the plaintiff (as opposed to simply defending against the plaintiff's claims asserted in the civil complaint); note that you do not seek "claims for relief" unless you are asserting a claim against a party in your own right.  You will need to furnish a substantive response in the form of an Answer within the deadline or seek a 30-day extension by filing a Motion to Extend Time within the first allotted ###.Even if you do not wish to or cannot afford to hire a family law attorney for the long-term duration of this case I would meet at least once with a family law attorney nearby and pay a consultation fee so that you can get an hour with a family law professional who can look over your paperwork to make sure it is done correctly and who can give you insights and pointers about the local District Court judges who might hear your case which you will likely not get on this website.Use ### "Find a Lawyer" feature or call the ### County Bar if you need assistance with referrals.

North Carolina law presumes, from the outset at least, that both biological parents are equally entitled to custody of their children in the event of a divorce or break up, unless a District Court judge has compelling reason (such as abuse, ###, neglect or abandonment by the parent) to rule one parent unfit to raise and care for the child.  Even when the judge allows one parent to have sole custody of the child, the non-custodial parent will usually have substantial visitation rights so long as the non-custodial parent is not a danger to the child.Whether you can remain in your present home ultimately depends on your ### parents, assuming they are the owners on the deed.  They have to provide you with a certain degree of notice first, depending on how long you have been there and whether you contribute anything to the utilities, mortgage or upkeep of the property with any regularity.  Eventually they can set a firm date for ### seven or ###--and then evict you through the courts if you decide not to honor the effective date to vacate the premises.  However, this does not in any way mean that your rights as a parent are negated.  If you and your ex-fiance are for sure not going to get married, you will eventually need to take this matter to District Court, where you either have a contested custody trial in front of the judge, or you can enter a consent decree before the judge based on prior agreement between the parties.  While you can certainly try to do either of these on your own, the best results (and the less headache in trying to navigate the complicated rules and procedures of the court system) will require legal representation.If funds for a family law attorney is out of the question, do two things this week: first, contact the ### County District Court (or visit at the courthouse) and see if they offer self-help filing packets for pro se litigants in custody matters (some courthouses do, and others do not).  Second, contact the ### Family Law Clinic, and see if someone can speak with you briefly about how to best tackle this on your own, and also request a ###" packet that is offered for around $### $25 (last time I checked).  See the link to the clinic below:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/###/I hope this helps you get started.  This entire process might take anywhere from three to six months depending on how quickly you get on it and also whether you engage a family law attorney to advocate for your interests with respect to your children.  Please also factor in delays due to courthouse closures for both Christmas and New Year's Day.Blessings to you and your children."43808.7430555556 I have two children with my ex fiance and currently reside with his parents. My whole family is in Massachusetts. What are my rights to my children if I were to move out. He's trying to kick me out and keep my children but he does nothing for them.43808.7243055556 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Legally speaking, all of your son's father's threats are smoking mirrors, and he cannot legally do any of the things he says he will do.  I suspect that at some level he is aware of this, and is using these threats mostly as a form of a mind game and for intimidation purposes.  He cannot just sign away" rights (makes no legal sense at all) and he cannot have you arrested absent credible evidence that you are doing harmful or illegal things in the presence in your child or in such a way that threaten harm to your child.Secondly you might have strong grounds for full custody but you would need to sue the father and have a custody trial in ### County District Court.  A judge would need to hear your testimony (and that of any other witnesses including the father if he shows up and participates) and examine any other evidence to determine what is in your son's best interests as the minor child.  Judges will consider taking away a biological parent's right to custody of his/her child in cases where neglect abandonment abuse ### or other conduct "inconsistent with parental status" can be established to the judge's satisfaction.  The law presumes a biological parent's constitutional rights to care and custody of his/her own child but this can be ### in exceptional circumstances.  It appears that you have such circumstances in play here.While you have the right to pursue full custody by yourself you will get better results if you retain local family law counsel to handle this for you.  If money is an immediate issue in terms of retaining counsel consider contacting the ### Family Law Clinic and ask them for a consultation and for a "###" packet (which I think they offer on certain days of the week for around $### $25 the last time I checked).  See the link here:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/###/Lastly also call or visit the courthouse and ask if the District Court offers self-help filing packets for pro se litigants in custody matters.God bless you and your son as you work through these challenges.

You need to not only find a ### law attorney in your area but someone with DSS/CPS experience. You can try to do an Internet search for that type of attorney by searching for child protective services" attorney or you can also go to the courthouse where they hear these cases and sit and watch some of the cases and see the attorneys who are coming into the courtroom who handle these kinds of cases. Any person in NC can file an action for custody under NC ### Statute 50-13.1 however because you are a grandparent you must allege unfitness neglect or acts inconsistent with the parent's protected constitutional rights.  These terms must be expressly used or your claim will be dismissed. You have to show that both the biological mom and dad are not good for the children and because the signed over their rights that should be enough to show "acts inconsistent." Because DSS is already involved I don't know that the regular domestic court would have the authority to hear your custody action so you might have to file the custody action as a third party ### in the DSS case. This is why I said it is complicated and you would need to find the right attorney. If you cannot find someone in your county there are others in more metropolitan areas who should be able to help. You can call the NC Bar Referral service to try to get some names as well. I would do something as soon as possible.

A few clarifying questions: -Do you both own the house (ie both on the deed)? The house was not addressed in the divorce proceedings? Is here a mortgage or lien on the house? -He does not owe any type of alimony? -Who currently lives with you? It sounds like all three children are of the age of majority (###) and your ex-husband will not be required to pay further child support. Assuming you both own the house, it will require both of you to consent to the sale. However, if you are making all of the house payments (also assuming there is a mortgage), than you could claim an equity argument for a majority of interest in the home. Keep in mind, practically speaking, you are both 50/###. A sale would likely be in your best (and probably his) best interests. Do you foresee that becoming an issue? I look forward to your response.###43810.8152777778 Hello ###!Yes both our names are on the deed.

All child support obligations end upon the child's reaching his/her eighteenth birthday.

Were you married to the father of your children? If not, he will need to establish paternity to claim rights to visitation or custody. He may file a paternity action to obtain these rights. When making custody and visitation decisions the court will look at what is in the best interests of your children. You would then develop a parenting agreement and that agreement will instruct on where the children live. If the father of your children has issues with where or with whom you live, he will have to file a motion with the court to modify the agreement. Again, assuming that the father of your children has not established paternity, you can deny visitation and move where you please.I hope this helps to answer your question. Please let me know if you have additional questions.43851.1 What are my rights as a single mother? What are the rights of the father?

You and your husband are separated but not legally divorced. You also have a restraining order preventing him from contacting you. During your year of separation as required to obtain a divorce in North Carolina your husband sold the marital home. The deed to the home was in his name only, did he own the home before you were married? Additionally was there a mortgage on the home? He then kept the proceeds because it was a cash sale.Before I can give you an answer I'll need a bit more information:Please confirm you are still legally married.Please confirm in whose name the house was listed.Please confirm whether you as ### spouse actively participated in the improvement of the home.Please confirm this was your primary residence prior to the separation.Please confirm that as part of any proceedings you have not come to any agreement with ### regarding the ownership of the home.Generally in North Carolina (though not specific to your case) a home purchased prior to the marriage and titled in one spouse's name is considered separate property. However, there are exceptions. The first is that if you actively worked to increase the home's value that may be considered an interest for you. However, passive appreciation, in other words the increase in value of the home over time is not considered marital property. Unless Mr. ### took active steps to transfer or gift title of his separate property to you after marriage, it is likely the court would treat the home as separate property during a divorce proceeding. Below is a helpful article which may shed some light on the differences between marital property and separate property in North Carolina. ###/I hope that this response has helped to assist you. Sincerely,###43837.5826388889 I am thinking of divorce I have a one-year separation through a restraining order from my husband for abuse neglect abandonment and adultery while in the separation my husband sold the marital home it was paid in cash paid off from the sale of the prior property that he stole owned before we got married he sold the property for less than what he paid for it without my consent or written name is this legal and what can I do43814.81875  I am in a gay marriage married and ###st ### ###th ###  a ### restraining order my husband has abused me physically and mentally abandon me in our formal home neglected me and cheated on me multiple times I'm currently waiting the disability decision I have no money to find a cheap lawyer what can I do43814.8215277778 I'm concerned if i can get alimony and part of his pension and remain his beneficiary on his life insurance polices.

Generally, if you make substantially less than your spouse you will qualify. You will be entitled to a share of your spouse's pension plan if your spouse worked and earned the pension during the marriage. The court has the right to divide the marital portion of the plan by either valuing it and offsetting against other assets or dividing in half by an order called a Qualified Domestic Relations Order."If you have been married for ###. Generally speaking NC courts do not have the authority to order someone to name their spouse as beneficiary on life insurance. Your spouse could agree to do this but absent agreement a Court cannot order it. "43852.7256944444 Hi ###,In your situation, you will need to tackle the jurisdiction issue first. Because both parents have moved from New York to North Carolina, the New York court that originally issued the child support order no longer has jurisdiction over the order. That is why all of the NY state agencies are telling you that they cannot change the order.So you do need to file a petition in NC, like the NY judge said.  I have attached to this message instructions for filing the petition, the petition form, and notice of petition form. You will also need a certified copy of the order from the NY court to file in NC.Follow the instructions, fill out the forms, and bring them all to the Clerk of Court office.  Once that is submitted, mail a copy of the petition and notice to the child's mother.If the clerks office is still telling you that they cannot transfer the custody order to their jurisdiction because it is an open case, you will need to voluntarily dismiss the petition you filed in the NY case and resubmit the forms. That should close any outstanding issues.Once the order has been transferred to NC, you will be able to ask the court for a modification and address the garnishment issue.  But since both parents are in NC, only an NC court will do this, which is why it is important for you to get the order to NC.Best of luck.43817.7541666667 My situation is as follows..I resided in The ###, NY  from 2005 - ###. An order for child support was issued in ### Family Court in 2014. I became disabled in October of ###. I applied for SSDI and was approved in ### of 2018. I filed a petition to have the order modified and went before Support Magistrate ### ### in The ### Family Court in September of 2018. I was told by the Magistrate that because both parents reside outside of the state of NY, that NY no longer had jurisdiction over the case and that they could not enforce or modify the order. I was advised that my child's mother (### ###) had to close the case in NY and refile in the state of North Carolina where she resided. My purpose for filing the petition was to stop the arrears from adding up and to let the court know that I was receiving SSDI and that my daughter was now receiving $###. The order at that time, should have been modified to reflect the time that I was disabled and could not work. Also to reflect my current income from SSDI which was approximately $###.

I was advised by the Magistrate that I needed to file a petition in North Carolina ( where I now reside to be closer to my daughter) to have the support order modified. I have spoken with Court Officials here in ### County where I reside and in ### County where Miss ### resides and was told that North Carolina can not and will not do anything because it is an open case in NY State.I have also spoken to Clerks in The ### Family Court, NY Child Support Enforcement Supervisors, The Inter-State Child Support Enforcement Office and every other ### that I could think of that may have a solution for me to get this resolved. Everyone that I have spoken to tells me there is nothing they can do and that I need to file a new petition/ motion in court.At this point I am just looking to have the original order modified and the amount that Miss ### has received to be credited towards my arrears. Any assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.43816.0090277778 Okay, I did not realize you only have a child support order and not a child custody order. In that case, the same reasoning and necessity of moving the order to North Carolina apply, but you should use the form attached to this message instead.This form is for registering a child support order from another state, and you can indicate on that form that you wish to modify the order.43829.6270833333 Thank you so much.

I43816.3152777778 Your sister's estate and your niece's assets are separate issues.  You will have an easier time straightening this out if you think about one at a time.First, your sister's estate.  If it is under $30,###, you can do an Affidavit for ###" which is an easier way to transfer small estates.  You will not need to run an ad for creditors.  You go down to the Clerk and fill out an affidavit showing that you are second in line to manage this and the first in line your niece has not and cannot apply.  There will be some ### around but you should be able to get that opened. That will give you a paper to take to the bank to collect the money.  The Court will not take the steps for this.  You must do it yourself or ask the court to appoint someone to do it for your sister.Then you need to resolve your niece's issues.  Does she have any ability to understand what is going on?  If she is so ill that she cannot understand then you or someone needs to be her guardian.  There are two kinds of guardians - of the person and of the estate (her money). Being guardian of the money is a little complicated but you or someone must be that to collect the money for her spend it all on her funeral and other needs as quickly as possible so she can requalify for Medicaid and other benefits. This does not happen automatically so you need to know where to push. Medicaid does not take her money they just stop paying her benefits until her money is all spent so you need to spend it the same day you get it.As you can see there are a lot of steps!  One thing you could do is see if Social Services will help by becoming her guardian and have a court appointed guardian of her funds.  This would get it done and done correctly.  You might also talk with the business office at your niece's nursing home to see if they know how to help you.

The IRS will note this when you are living at separate residences after separation and divorce (if you have not done so already), so if you are living in separate households, it is most probable that only one parent will get the benefit of claiming minor children as dependents for tax purposes.  According to what you cited here, that person would be your wife.I totally agree with you that, at minimum, consulting with a local family law attorney once (even if you do not hire counsel for the long-term custody proceeding) would be wise since there are likely other provisions in the proposed consent ### that would merit further discussion between you and a family law attorney.  I recommend using ### Find a Lawyer" feature and contacting the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association if you need help in generating a ### of names of lawyers with whom you might wish to consult and share copies of the paperwork with before signaling your assent prior to institution of the action by your wife.  Your thinking on this is right on point.Lastly you might also call the ### County Bar Association and see if they have any helpful suggestions about family law counsel in your local community.  Here is the link below:https://www.###cobar.org/I hope this is enough information to get you started.  God bless you and your family this holiday season and in ###."43816.9083333333 I have been sent the consent form to look over from my separated spouse she wants to know if I agree to the ### before serving papers. we have both currently agree to no-fault divorce and we are ### out details of custody with 50/###.  we have not to talk ed about taxes and how they pertain to our son. she has a higher average gross income she will most likely continue for the next few years to be able to claim him. I agree she should have this opportunity as long as she is bearing a larger financial burden. I do not agree to give up sole taxable income that could later be helpful to my son if custody changes to 60/###. I am also currently looking for a local attorney to represent me in this matter. 43816.9 It is possible the Judge will allow the modification back to the date of the custody modification assuming proper paperwork was filed and the custody order was clear. 43852.7270833333 My ex and I have a current child support order already in where I pay ###. He just recently filed for a modification because the custody order has changed and now, I which this custody change happened in ### of this year. In this support modification he is wanting to change the support to worksheet a, but he is also wanting this modification to begin in ###, in which is going to cost me an extra ###, on top of what the child support orders me.

Will the judge allow it?43817.4145833333 ###,I'm not in Wake county, but I recommend you call the ### Law Firm, ###.  You may want to have a Bankruptcy consultation.  Some judgments can be discharged in bankruptcy.  Unfortunately, if the alimony is spousal support, that cannot be discharged; but any portions that are property settlements can be.  Bankruptcy can stop the current action and give you a chance to pay the alimony over a ### ### (chapter ###).  It may be helpful for you to have a bankruptcy attorney review the judgment with you and your options.  Most bankruptcy attorneys have a free consultation, so it wouldn't hurt you to sit down and talk with one.  Good luck!### ### ###### Banks Legal Services, Inc.43830.5625 Divorced in 2014. Signed a unincorporated separation agreement which lists alimony at $###. I originally got behind due to a job loss ###.  She refused to let me pay her once I got back on my feet so she took a judgment out on me.  I remarried and my wife owns a company that is an LLC.  She is listed as the only owner and agent.  Bank accounts for the company are in her name only.  I am not even a signer on the accounts.  Both my new wife and I are paid weekly from the company.  My ex-wife is now suing me and my wifeâ€™s company saying that I am hiding my assets behind the company. The attorney is asking for the court to order me to pay the judgment.  Can they do that? Iâ€™m not the legal owner of the company. IF a court did order me to pay. How would that work? Garnish my wages at 25% per pay or could they make me pay within ###?  Itâ€™s about $21,000.  How do I defend against this ? I have tried many times to settle out of court and she refuses because she has an ### separation agreement that I so ### signed.  43817.8479166667 Ms Keaton,Typically, a parent cannot unilaterally terminate (or sign over) their parental rights unless (###) there is a step-parent or other party in the process of adopting the child, or (###) if there is an active abuse/neglect/dependency case against the parent.  In most cases parents aren't just allowed to voluntarily sign over their rights because lots of parents would do it just to get out of paying child support. You may be able to file a petition against the father to ask the court to terminate the father's rights based on certain specific criteria.  For example, a parent's rights may be terminated if the parent has willfully abandoned his child for a certain period of time.  However, the court must consider lots of criteria when terminating a parent's rights.  They do not make that decision lightly.I would recommend speaking with an attorney at your local Legal Aid of North Carolina office.  The statewide number is ###-866-###.  They may be able to provide some guidance and/or refer you to a local family law attorney.  Keep in mind that if you choose to ask the court to terminate the father's parental rights (and DSS is not involved), you will have to provide your own attorney, or represent yourself.  I wish you the best of luck.43844.8756944444 My childâ€™s father wants to sign over his rights. How do I go about it.

You have a couple options in this situation, although I seriously doubt that you will be able to find a family law attorney who is willing to do this for free (too many hours to work without earning revenue for the law practice, which is costly to keep running).  However, I would contact the ### County District Court and see if they offer self-help filing packets for custody matters.  If not, contact the ### Family Law Clinic, and see if one of their staff will speak with you by phone for a free consultation, and also whether can order one of the ###" custody packets; the last time I checked they cost either $### $25 so you might consider this option as well.  See the link below:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/###/In the event that you wish to search for attorneys who might be willing to do this on a no-cost basis I recommend using ###'s "Find a Lawyer" search function (it is free) and also the ### County Bar Association's "Find a Lawyer Now" feature (also free I believe).

She has attempted several times to keep cps from speaking to me including giving them a fake number. We have joint custody and as a result her parents are not letting me see the kids when I have completed a home study and have been told there are no legal obstructions or objections to me seeing the boys.  Is there any way I can file for emergency custody? I have text messages from my ex stating her dad is screaming at my youngest son who is autistic. Will this overstep the temporary safety placement as well? I have been told that I may have the boys permanent placed with me but the case is transferring from ### county to iredell.

I found out after the fact that he took them out from the schools they were going to. I simply asked for a break and so much happened without my knowing. I do understand that since neither of us have sole legal custody of them we each have the rights to do what ever. I felt we had a system going and it flowed and didn't interfere too much with what he had going on. Never thought my children would be separated like this. There is no trust or honesty with what's taken place and I don't know what to do. He goes out of town and not adhering to what we agreed to as far as the time spent at both homes like its suppose to. Legal binding documents need to be put in place and followed to keep stability and order for the kids. Nothing is being followed as he and I discussed. Please advise me on what to do and where to go.

Yes, if all possible, having legal representation at a child support hearing will be highly useful in promoting your cause.

I hope you can help my situation.As of right now I am still a citizen of my home country Russia. My name in my russian documents doesn't match my name in the USA birth certificate of my children. I got married here in USA and took my husband's last name, my drivers license, my USA passport has my new name ###. But all of my russian documents still have my maiden name ###. They don't accept that I'm the mother to the kids as my name on the birth certificate of the kids is different from my russian passport.My marriage certificate doesn't state that I took my husband's last name. I need to prove somehow that the name change took place. I need a legal document where it will say that ### became ###. How can i obtain a document like that confirming the name change? Thank you for your time43829.7583333333 Hello,A marriage certificate would not indicate if you took your husband's last name. To prove that your last name changed due to marriage you would need to do the following:Get a certified copy of your marriage license from the Register of Deeds office in your county of residence. This can be done by mail or in person and requires the payment of a fee (varies based on county but it is normally a small cost).###. Then you would go to the Social Security Office and complete an application for a social security card with your new last (married) name. You can obtain a copy of the application form on the Social Security Administration's website, from a local SSA office, a Social Security Card Center or by calling 800-###.###. You would then file the form Application for a Social Security Card" and original identifying documents with the SSA. There is no fee to apply for a new card but you must enclose the certified copy of your marriage certificate documentary proof of your age such as a birth certificate and either your U.S. passport or a state-issued driverâ€™s license or identification card. You can mail the application and supporting documents to any SSA office or do it in person.###.  After the filling you should receive a new social security card with your updated name in the mail within ###. ###. After this process is complete you must still notify other agencies organizations and individuals that will continue to identify and address you under your maiden name with the updated name change. Your new social security card will be enough to update all other documents. Best of luck."43855.9784722222 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  You are very wise to desire sharing your separation agreement with a family law attorney for a consultation and review before signing it and making it official.  I totally ### in your judgment, and I believe you can find a good family law attorney who would do this for a reasonable consultation fee.Attorneys are ### prohibited from direct solicitation of new clients, so the prospective client must reach out to the attorney first.  I suggest ### Find a Lawyer" search feature and contacting the Wake County Bar for referrals.

That is why I would like to be careful with my separation agreement. I would like an attorney to read the agreement and give me advice about it.I am ready to pay a small consultation fee, even though I prefer probing, if an attorney can  read my Separation Agreement and give me feedback, if it's okay to share with my husband. 43829.8451388889 How to get help financial if husband walked away?How to go about separtion papers?43829.8638888889 If you and your husband resided in ### County, you will need to file for divorce with the district court and request post-separation spousal support and/or alimony.  If you and your husband resided elsewhere, you'll need to file there.  Look up that county's family court for the applicable rules and forms.  Since you are asking for support and/or alimony, you will be required to provide financial information -- this can be a complicated process and as such it is highly recommended that you obtain a family law attorney. Do you and your husband own property?  A home?  A car?  Who should receive that property or how should it be split?  This is called equitable distribution and can, again, be complex.  An attorney would be able to help.If you have children there will be a host of other matters to consider.  Who should get legal custody?  Physical custody?  What about visitation?  Who will carry your children on their health insurance policy?  What about child support?  How should school expenses be paid?  What about college or trade school?    If you will be asking for child support or need to establish custody or a visitation plan, hire an attorney to ensure your children's interests are protected.If you would like to review ### County family court's local rules on filing for divorce and asking for spousal support without an attorney (this is called pro se") then you may find them here: https://www.nccourts.gov/assets/documents/local-rules-forms/Local%20Rules%20of%20Domestic%20Court%20%5B.%20.%20.%5D.pdf?J2p6_A7.a50qLYs1CDLlvI3tToMrfhqPLinks to the appropriate forms are within the local rules.  Pay close attention to Rule ###-separation spousal support and alimony. Also review some of the documents on the last page.  Especially the Domestic Coversheet and Affidavit of Financial Standing.From reviewing the documents you'll see that requesting financial support from your husband is a complicated process.  If you have property to divide or children it will be even more complicated.  Consult a family law attorney.  Some attorneys can negotiate their rates provide flat fees or provide select services such as helping you complete forms.Best of luck."43838.7194444444 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  The only way to confirm present title to your stepfather's property is to have a real property lawyer compare and contrast the ###.  If your stepfather deeded to you a life estate in 2007, the legal presumption would be that you are the owner for the remainder of your natural life.  However, a lawyer would need to read the relevant legal documents before confirming that for certain.  I do not think it would take very long to figure this out, once a qualified lawyer has read the deed and the will.  But at first glance, I see no reason why the property would not be yours if the ###.Keep in mind that when a deed and will conflict as to the same piece of real property, the deed controls over the will.  A lawyer would still want to read both, but the deed is more important as long as it was executed prior to the owner's death.I recommend reaching out to both Legal Aid of North Carolina and Pisgah Legal Services, and seeing if either could provide you with a consultation and legal advice based on a review of the deed and will.

Based on what you have written here, I do not think ### alimony payments will likely occur, although you can seek enforcement of the separation/divorce agreement if there is a valid one in writing.  I would speak with a ### County family law attorney and consult for maybe ### ###, and share a copy of your agreement.  A ### County District Court judge has the power to compel your former wife to honor the agreement and cease and desist from hosting ### overnight when your children are present.  It might also be helpful to you (and less expensive) to have your family law attorney first send your ex-wife a legal advisory letter warning that you are willing to litigate this matter further if she does not comply with the agreement, and that the least painful route, financially and otherwise, is for both parties to comply with the agreement without having to go to court and fight about it.  If your ex-wife does not heed your attorney's written warning, you can then seek enforcement from the District Court.Hopefully the letter approach will work, since that will save you time, headache and money.  I wish you the very best in this matter, and the best to you and your children in ###.

This is an area of law with many moving parts.Initially, the gentleman that you care for will need to become Medicaid eligible by reducing most assets that are in his name to no more than $2,000.  His home will not be counted as long as he intends to return home OR a dependent relative lives in the home.If he receives Medicaid to pay for nursing home care, the state has a right to recover the benefits that it paid for his care from his probate estate (likely, his home) after he passes away.  There is an exception to estate recovery if you can prove that it would cause hardship and you are a relative.If you are not related to this man and he is competent to make decisions, he may choose to give you an interest in the property to avoid the Medicaid recovery process.  This would likely take the form of a deeded joint interest, and would need to be done before he applies for Medicaid.I hope this is helpful!43836.9756944444 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thanks for your question, and a blessed New Year to you and your children.

What can I do to make sure I have full custody? 43832.7055555556 Domestic Violence Protective Orders, more commonly referred to as ###, are generally issued for causing bodily injury to the partner or child, placing the partner in fear of bodily injury, or committing other violent illegal acts toward a person with whom you have a personal relationship. A DVPO may prohibit the defendant from contacting the plaintiff or the minor child(ren) among other restrictions. ### cannot be put into place without a request from at least one party.Generally, the plaintiff (the person filing for the protective order) fills out a Complaint and Motion for Domestic Violence Protective Order" and gives the complaint/motion to the clerk of court. The judge then holds a short "ex-parte" hearing where the plaintiff explains what acts of domestic violence have been committed by the defendant. If the judge finds that the defendant has committed acts of domestic violence the judge will grant the ex-parte order which is a short ### order than lasts until the next hearing. The judge will tell the plaintiff when to appear in court for the next hearing. In the interim the sheriff's office will try to serve the defendant with the complaint and ex-parte order so the defendant will be aware of the upcoming hearing and the restrictions against him/her.On the hearing date a few things can happen: If defendant does not appear AND defendant has not been served with the complaint/motion for DVPO the court will continue the hearing so defendant can be served and present evidence if he/she chooses.If defendant does not appear AND defendant has been served with the complaint/motion for DVPO the court can still hear evidence from the plaintiff and decide whether to grant a one-year DVPO.If defendant appears and plaintiff does not appear the plaintiff's request for a DVPO will usually be dismissed.If both defendant and plaintiff appear and BOTH sides want a DVPO in place the judge can sign an order granting the one-year DVPO without a hearing. If both defendant and plaintiff appear and NEITHER side wants a DVPO in place (plaintiff has changed mind etc.) the plaintiff can file a dismissal with the clerk's office or the plaintiff can tell the judge he/she no longer desires to have a DVPO in place. If both defendant and plaintiff appear and they cannot agree on whether a DVPO should be put into place the judge will hear evidence from both sides and make a decision on whether to grant the one-year DVPO. This evidence can include medical records photographs witness statements arrest records or any other relevant documents. Once a DVPO is put into place under N.C.G.S. Â§ 50B-3(b2) the order can be modified or set aside altogether if "good cause" can be shown. The plaintiff will have to file a motion with the clerk's office to have the DVPO modified or set aside. If neither you or your child's father requested a protective order more than likely it is not a DVPO but another form of a no-contact order. A judge may put a no-contact order into place when a defendant is charged with a crime of domestic violence in order to assure that the victim is safe while the criminal case is pending.  If the defendant violates the no-contact order while the case is pending the defendant's bond can be revoked and the defendant can be arrested. The no-contact order remains in place until the criminal case is disposed (i.e. defendant pleads guilty defendant found guilty or charge(s) dismissed) OR the judge ### the no-contact order at the request of the victim.A no-contact order may also be put into place as a probationary condition. For example if a defendant pleads guilty to assaulting his girlfriend and defendant is given probation the judge could order that the defendant not have contact with the girlfriend while defendant is on probation which could be for years. A probationary no-contact order will remain in place as long as the defendant is on probation or until a judge strikes the no-contact provision. Regardless of what kind of no-contact order is in place the order can be modified or set aside by a judge if you request it. Until the order is ### you cannot have contact with your child's father. You cannot give him permission to violate the order and vice versa. If he does violate the order he could be arrested and placed in jail. Because there are questions surrounding what type of order is currently in place I'd suggest contacting an attorney who can review the file(s) and advise you of what type of order is in place and the best way to modify or set that order aside. Good luck! "43872.8354166667 How do I go about appealing a dvpo that a judge put in place between me and my child's father when neither of us requested the dvpo? 43833.6326388889 Hi ###,If you and your child's father are on speaking terms and have an unwritten custody agreement, you could file a 'friendly lawsuit' and have a Consent Order for Child Custody that sets out in writing what the legal and physical custody agreement is and then have a judge sign it so it is not only public record but legally binding.  If both parents do not have an agreement, you could file a custody lawsuit and then go to custody mediation at your local courthouse.  This is a legally required mediation for custody lawsuits and the only people present during the mediation are you, your child's father, and the court custody mediator.  If you both come to an agreement at mediation, then the mediator will draft a Parenting Agreement" (different counties can call it something else but essentially the same thing) and then once you and your child's father sign it before a notary and return it to the mediator the mediator will have a Judge sign off on it to make it legally binding.  I am attaching the Legal Aid of NC Pro Se packet for filing a custody ### Aid of NC also has a video that you can view on their website: http://www.legalaidnc.org/get-help/self-help-clinics/child-custody-and-visitation.

If not who does the stated property go to?43835.1590277778 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and a blessed new year to you.  Your question is squarely addressed by N.C.G.S. Â§ ### known as the ###" rule.  Basically it amounts to this: beneficiaries are "competent" to be witnesses to a will HOWEVER if there are not at least two other witnesses who are "disinterested" in the sense that they have no stake in the will at all and are at ### from the testator the beneficiaries will NOT inherit from the will.  Insofar as the two beneficiaries are concerned the will is void although it can still be legally effective regarding other beneficiaries.  But if the only witnesses are the two beneficiaries and no one else except the two beneficiaries are provided for in the will the will is more or less a dead letter.If there are four witnesses two of whom are disinterested persons the beneficiaries can take under the will.If the will is void in practical effect due to no other beneficiaries named than the two witnesses and there are no extra witnesses the most likely outcome is that the estate will be disposed of as if no will had ever been admitted into ### intestate succession would occur.  This means that the decedent's next-of-kin ### inherit.  Depending on the decedent's family situation at death this could be a combination of a surviving spouse and children; just the children and/or grandchildren (if one of the children has already died before the decedent whose estate is being administered); or in cases where there is neither a spouse nor lineal descendants a surviving parent sibling or niece and nephew in that order followed by cousins of closest blood association.Hope that makes sense.  You asked a very good question.  Have a rewarding and productive new year."43835.9243055556 I have been separated from my husband since October now and I would like to get a separation agreement written out and I was wondering how I could do that if I donâ€™t have the financial resources to get a lawyer?43836.1409722222 You are not required to have an attorney draft a Separation Agreement. The only requirement is that the document be in writing signed and notarized. A separation agreement is generally an agreement about child custody, child support, alimony, and property.You do not need a separation agreement in order to be legally separated. You are separated in NC once you are physically separated and at least one personhas expressed intent for that separation to be permanent.Hope that helps to clarify.43852.73125 I am in massachusetts with no legal rights to my ###, NC.

If you and your wife are still legally married but separated (meaning living separate and a part) you can receive postseparation support (sousal support) through the courts. You can receive postseparation support or alimony (if divorced) if you are a dependent spouse. The general rule is that a spouse is dependent when he or she makes less money than the other spouse. A judge will look at these factors to determine if you are a dependent spouse in order to receive spousal support: marital misconduct during the marriage and prior to date of separation by both spouses;the relative earnings and earning capacities of the spouses;the ages and the physical, mental, and emotional conditions of the spouses;the amount and sources of earned and unearned income of both spouseshow long you've been married;if there is contribution by one spouse to the education, training, or increased earning power of the other spouse;the standard of living of the spouses established during the marriage;the relative education of the spousesthe relative assets and debt of the spousesthe contribution of a spouse as homemaker;the relative needs of the spousesBased on the information you've provided, it appears you have a solid claim to seek spousal support and the fact that you receive disability does help your claim. In order to go about seeking this support you will, however, need to get a attorney to file with the courts for support. Please contact Legal Aid of NC at ###-### to seek assistance. They will either connect you with an attorney or set up a Self Help Clinic" and show you how to file for the support yourself without the cost of an attorney.  Best of luck on your situation.

You have identified a fair and ### solution.  But, it should be documented and you should not overlook the legal issues and expenses.  You will need some sort of estate administration in both states and ###ds from both of you to the final owner.  You should add the expense of that to the total and take your brother's half out of the cash you would be giving him.  As you are working on this, you want to be very sure that these steps are taken correctly now, so that you will have clear title when you get ready to sell years into the future.  It can get extremely difficult to fix title problems when they are discovered  years later -- people have forgotten what they agreed to do or have gotten sick or died.

Thank you!43841.8041666667 My mother passed away and in her final wishes she indicated that my brother and I (her only children) should split her assets 50/50.  There are two properties in the estate, a Coop in ### and a Townhome in NC.  My brother and I have agreed not to sell the homes at this time and to instead split the equity.  My question is what is the standard method to achieve this fairly?We received market value estimates from realtors in both NY and NC.  The NY Coop was estimated at $100K and the NC property at $167K.  We deducted the remaining mortgage due on the townhome of $6###K (the coop is paid for) to arrive at a net equity of $TERM00065###,000.

The issue at this point is agreement and I feel I am due to pay my brother $### be split but instead because my property is valued at $### $5000.  Which to me is not honoring my motherâ€™s desire for a 50/###.  At this point Iâ€™m trying to figure out what the standard legal approach would to resolve this matter.Also, we have agreed to each pay the costs associated with transferring title for our respective properties.43838.11875 You are correct!  It is hard to reason with someone who has an answer stuck in their mind.  You have to figure out a way to move his thinking.  Ask him to consider how it would work if he took the NC property -- offer it to him so that you get the deal he wants.  Or offer to sell both pieces and talk about how much you would each get.If he would go talk to a lawyer, someone more objective than he thinks you are, he might get convinced.Good luck,###43838.6020833333 I got married in ###. We split apart soon after she came to the US but we never got a divorce. I did file a divorce but it was never finalized and I just found out that she died ###. She had a baby with another man while still married to me, her daughter is about ### ###. The father was never added to the birth certificate because he is addicted to heroin and not a good person for the kid to be with. Now the grandmother came from Colombia and wants to take the grandchild to Colombia to live with her so that she can have a decent future, otherwise she will end up in the government system here in the US. The grandmother wants me to sign to be able to get the child a passport so she can travel. I guess right now I'm  her only way to get the kid out of the US since we were still married. My question is, if I do sign, what could be the legal consequences that I could face? I do not want to be responsible for the child in any way, and I don't  believe that the grandmother would try to put me on child support or anything like that. But I would like to know what I'm  up against if I do sign. Thank you!43838.0708333333 Unfortunately, the grandmother is misinformed. Your signature will not be beneficial to the child. The signatories must be the child's parents, not the husband of the mother and the mother. There are procedures that can be used in instances such as this. Please encourage the grandmother to go to the US Passport website to find alternatives. They are available. The following website may be helpful.https://passportinfo.com/blog/child-passports-with-unusual-family-situations/43852.7388888889 Hi ###,North Carolina is one of the few states that does allow adult adoption; however, your step mother would be adopting you, so you are correct, she is the petitioner. That means she will need to sign the documents. It's wonderful that you want to surprise her, but have you asked her formally to adopt you? It sounds like you two have a great relationship, so I am sure she will be thrilled. As part of this process she will file the petition and you and she will attend a hearing in the Courts. The statute that allows this is Chapter ### ###. You can find that here: https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_48/Article_5.pdfThings you should know:Adoption is a serious process and changes relationships drastically.You will no longer have any legal right to inherit from your biological mother, unless a will provides to the contrary.Your biological mother will no longer have any parental rights, though as an adult she really doesn't have many. Your biological mother will not be able to inherit from you unless a will provides to the contrary.Who must consent:YouYour stepmomYour dadYou must acknowledge your consent in writing and get that acknowledgment signed by notary. I would just type up a document saying you consent to the adoption by your stepmother and state her full legal name. Then go get that signed in front of a notary. You can find notaries at your bank or UPS provides them for a small fee. I would also date this document. Something worded like this:I [INSERT YOUR FULL LEGAL NAME] hereby consent to be adopted as an adult by [INSERT ### LEGAL NAME]. In doing so I assume toward the adoptive parent the legal relation of parent and child and to have all of the rights and be subject to all of the duties of that relationship. I understand the consequences the adoption may have for rights of inheritance, property, or support, including the loss of nonvested inheritance rights which existed prior to the adoption and the acquisition of new inheritance rights.Your father must acknowledge his consent in the same manner you did. Worded as follows:I [INSERT DAD'S NAME] consent to the proposed adoption of [YOUR NAME] by [### NAME]. I understand that the adoption may diminish the amount I might take from the petitioner through intestate succession or by dissenting to the petitioner's will and may also diminish the amount of other entitlements that may become due to me and any other children of the petitioner through the petitioner. I believe the adoption will be in the best interest of the adult being adopted and the prospective adoptive parent.Please note that you or your stepmom must have lived in North Carolina at least six months preceding this adoption. Step mom's petition should include all of the following info:The full name of the adopteeStep mom's name and addressA promise that you or Stepmom have lived in North Carolina for six consecutive months immediately preceding the petitionWhere and when the adoptee was bornWhether you are related to the adopteeThe names, ages, and addresses of any adult children Step mom hasThe names, ages, and addresses of any adult children, parents, and spouses the adoptee hasStep mom may be required to show your birth certificate and some counties require a statement on why your step mom wants to adopt you. But most of the time that comes out in the hearing. It's a good idea when you go to the court to file this to have multiple copies of everything. Your birth certificate will need to be a certified copy you shouldn't give them your original, but a paper copy won't suffice. There will also be a filing fee, I believe it's $###.###.Within ###, stepmom needs to give notice in writing and have it served on the following:YouYour dadYour adult children if anyHer adult children, if anyYour biological mother does NOT need to be informed unless you want her to be. I would advise you to send a letter by certified mail with return receipt requested to her letting her know this is happening at her last known address. That way if the judge asks if you told her you can say yes and show the letter and the receipt. By statute she's not required to be notified since you are legally an adult but I would recommend just in case the judge gets hung up on it. The letter should state that her rights will be terminated at the hearing if she does not contest.The sheriff will serve these papers for you for $30.###. You can also higher a professional service agent. Unfortunately, this is a proceeding where service by mail does not appear to be acceptable. Stepmom will need to have her service agent or the sheriff file a proof of service with the court. ###-###. Then you'll go to your hearing. All interested parties should make a point to be there so the judge can ensure everyone is ok with this. ###. At the hearing the judge will sign the DSS 5166, bring this with you!! The judge doesn't have them on hand. Fill in all the blanks prior to the hearing with the exception of the judge's signature and a date.Remember after this to amend your birth certificate you'll need to file a DSS ###.It sounds like a very ### time for your family, congratulations in advance!Best,###43868.8854166667 I am trying to complete the paperwork for an adult adoption.

You will need a North Carolina estate planning or probate lawyer to represent ###, by sending on your behalf a written demand for a Certification of Trust" based on the North Carolina Uniform Trust Code (N.C.G.S. Chapter ###) and if that does not work suing the trustee for the information and maybe even for money damages if the trustee is discovered to have done something wrong.  Hopefully getting a ### demand letter from a lawyer on his/her law firm stationery will be sufficient to set this matter right but if not I seriously doubt that you can resolve an issue like this without a lawsuit against the trustee in which you are represented by counsel; this is not the kind of case one should pursue without legal counsel.### "Find a Lawyer" search feature is a good resource to use and you can also inquire with the ### County Bar or Buncombe County Bar.  You can inquire with Legal Aid of NC and Pisgah Legal Services as to whether either organization can help you for free but I tend to doubt that they would litigate this type of matter due to budget and time limitations.  It does not hurt or cost anything to ask however so please feel free to do so.  They might be able to help out with the letter approach even if they cannot litigate this for you.Sorry that you find yourself in such an undesirable situation.  I hope you can set things to right before long and receive your just due.

Please help me 43840.0993055556 If you are a registered owner you could potentially be held partially liable if your wife caused a wreck.  There are certain defenses that get into very case specific questions that can get around it having to do with things like who had control of the vehicle at the time of the wreck, was she driving on an ### for you, etc.  Further, there are certain statutory protections that make it difficult to collect jointly held assets (such as a house) when one spouse is not involved in the wreck.  But if you want to be ###00% certain you face no or limited liability you basically have two options:  ###)  Pay off the car and put it in your spouse's name (i.e. make it her car exclusively) ###)  Buy decent auto insurance to cover both of you in case she causes a wreck that causes injury or property damage.  How much depends on your personal financial situation and ability to pay.  It is typically not very expensive for most folks to up" their coverage.  You may also want to consider an "Umbrella" policy which could cover you and your wife for various kinds of events including auto ###.

The complaint and summons need to be served in one packet by either the Sheriff, a process server, or by certified mail pursuant to Rule ###.  See the Rule here:https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_1A/GS_1A-1,_Rule_###.pdfAfter you confirm service of the initial pleading, all other briefs, motions, proposed orders and other court papers can be served at the defendant's address by hand delivery or first-class mail under Rule 5 (see below):###Also be aware of the local rules of the county District Court where you are pursuing this matter.  You can find the local courthouse rules at ###.Take at least four (###) originals of the complaint and summons with ### for the Clerk, one to be served on the defendant, one for you, and one as a spare just in case something happens.  All originals should be stamped by the Clerk before service is effectuated.You need not file an Affidavit of Service form until you get the ### slip back in the mail if you are doing this by certified mail; when you get it back, you should promptly visit the courthouse and give them both the ### slip (make a copy for yourself first) and your Affidavit of Service (notarized).  An original stamped by the Clerk should go into the file, and you should have at least two (###) originals for yourself, which you should store safely in the same file as all other papers relating to the lawsuit.(Confirm the preferences as to timing of filing these documents with the assistant clerks at the courthouse.  They cannot provide legal advice, but they can often give you helpful tips about how all of this is really done in practice at that particular courthouse, as opposed to what lawyers learn theoretically in law school about litigation.)Assuming this is a divorce action, also check with the local District Court and see if they have a self-help packet or Frequently Asked Questions" form for people who wish to file on their own.

If so will they sign it and allow me to serve it at the time the Acceptance of service is done? 43842.1138888889 Oh, I see.  Thanks for clarifying.  I thought you meant a plaintiff's affidavit, but I now see that you mean one by the defendant; sorry for not understanding that in the beginning.I read over your attached form and it looks good to me; actually it is very similar to one I prepared for a divorce defendant when I sued on behalf of a client in family court two years ago.  Just make sure that it meets all the needs of the Clerk in terms of confirming true service.  The assistants at the courthouse should be able to confirm this, without having to cross over the threshold of giving legal advice.  My thinking on this, based on my own experience, is that as long as you promptly get the completed form back in notarized form from your husband, and you have a ### copy for the Clerk's permanent case file, you should be fine.Thanks for following up with me, and for your courtesy and professionalism.  It is much appreciated!  Blessings to you.43842.7444444444 Thank you for all of the great help!

Let me first offer a resource for you that might help if I cannot answer all of your questions on NC Free Legal Answers--the ### Family Law Clinic.  It is located in ###, but perhaps one of their staff can speak with you for ###, and point you in the right direction once they have seen the same attachment that you offered here.  Here is the website:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/Now, having said that, I read the entire document, and for the most part, I found it to be a well-drafted and balanced document; I saw no red flags in terms of bullying provisions or bad-faith provisions designed to hurt your interests as the father.  As I read it, it was clear to me that the intent was to make sure the mother had primary responsibility for ###'s medical insurance and other related financial upkeep (Paragraphs ### 12), while still allowing you to consult about actual healthcare decisions involving ###'s care, and also maintaining as balanced a custody schedule as possible, although it tilts a little more to the mother, which is normal for such agreements when the child is as young as ### is at present.  I am not saying necessarily that you should agree with everything in this document (of course, I do not know your situation enough to know whether this proposed arrangement is totally fair in your eyes), but only that I do not see anything malicious or crazy, designed to hurt your interests in being a present father for ###.If there are specific details about pickups, ###, legal holidays, weekends, etc. that you think are problematic, you should definitely raise them before signing the Consent Order in court.Are there any specific provisions that seem odd, or are not intelligible to you?  If so, let me know, and we can discuss them a little further; I am very glad to do so.The key thing here is to remember that if you and ###'s mother sign this, and the District Court judge enters the decree with the court's stamp and seal, this Consent Decree is as binding as if the judge had issued an order on his/her own terms.  Consent orders can be modified later, but not simply on a whim; generally the court likes to keep things stable by enforcing the instrument as last written and signed, unless one of the parties can make a compelling argument that a substantial change in situation has manifested enough that ###'s best interests are now not being served well.  Otherwise, you need to treat this as set in ###, at least for the next several years.Does this help?

I actually called the Cumberland County, NC Clerk's Office at ###.  They indicated that the order granting your name change petition has already been signed and entered by the judge.  The Clerk's Office also explained that a certificate of the name change is sent to the State's Vital Records department in ### (not to you) and that this has already been done.  Additionally, the Clerk's Office advised that you can obtain a certified copy of the judge's order granting your name change from the Clerk's Office by paying a $###, and that the certified copy of the order can then be used to update your name on other official documents like your driver's license by presenting the certified copy of the order to the DMV.  The Clerk's Office is located at ###, ###, NC ###.  Before going to the Clerk's Office to obtain a certified copy of the order you can also try calling them at the above phone number to get further details.  They noted that your file number (which you can give to them as a reference) is 19SP1685.  Also, I'm not sure if you were also hoping to change your birth certificate for your new name (to the extent you want to/haven't done so already).  To the extent that is something you are also looking to do, I found the following information on the State's Vital Records website:  An amended birth certificate reflecting a name change ordered by the courts may be processed for individuals who are born in North Carolina. Please complete the birth certificate application form providing the information to locate the original birth certificate.  You must include a certified copy of the name change court order along with your request. There is a fee of $### an additional charge of $### and $###. There are charges for faster service."  A link to the State's Vital Records website is here ### and you can try calling them at ###.I wish you nothing but the best of luck.Thank you."43873.8458333333 Submitted a legal name change ### (Dec. 13th) .

Just ready to change my legal documents and use my name legally 43845.0451388889 Hi ###,What you and your fiance have run into is there is a general guideline subject to few exceptions that single parents with custody of a child are not eligible to enlist unless custody of the child is assigned to another adult for the ### of ###.So what you may need to do is obtain temporary custody for your child for the ### of your fiance's ###.  To do this you will have to go through the court.  I attached a model complaint that you can use.  You should complete the form and file it in the district court in the county that you live in.  Make sure to bring ###, which is usually about $150.Here is a helpful website that had more information about the process of filing for child custody: ###Best of luck.43895.6451388889 Thank you for taking the time to help us. My fiance and I have a son who was born out of wedlock, the fathers name is on the birth certificate. We are still a couple, we live together and have a healthy relationship. My fiance is trying to ### in the Army and is unable to do so unless we have a custody agreement stating that I have full custody of our son in order for the military to know that he will be taken care of in the events of field problems or deployment. We don't want to have to go through the courts because we both agree on a parenting plan and just need to know how to legally put it on paper and make it official. What is our best course of action? No, we cannot afford an attorney at this time. Thank you again for your time, expertise, and consideration on this matter.### ###43845.7013888889 Hello< anyone?43851.0006944444 Hi ###, Your biggest issue is contempt more than kidnapping. You do have a court order in place so whether your son refuses to go to his dad's house or not YOU are personally bound to the terms of the court order until the court modifies the terms or you can get your ex to agree to something different in writing. Law enforcement has changed it's willingness to get involved in enforcing court orders (without a court order requiring them too) so unless your ex goes to court and gets a warrant or something requiring police involvement, I don't think that you need to worry about being criminally charged. That does not mean that you would not face jail time if the court holds you in criminal contempt. You need to make sure that you file a motion to modify as well as a motion to relocate and have that heard as soon as possible BEFORE moving to Pittsburgh. The court usually doesn't appreciate folks just doing what they want. If you move beforehand and then ask to stay the answer many times is no" versus asking for permission beforehand. The factors for relocation are laid out in a case called "### v. ###" that you can Google. While the court cannot force you to stay in NC they can force your son to stay. It will make it very hard for you to move to Pa. and then have to move back if the court forces you to do so. Make sure that your life is settled here with the courts before making such a big change.I hope that helps. ### "43852.7409722222 I have a 50/### (15) on various weekends for several years now.

In order to get support for your son you will need to file an action for child support. Since paternity has been established, the father has the same duties and obligations to care for your son as if he was legitimate. You mention potential issues with the father taking your son away not bringing him home as scheduled, in this case, I would also suggest a custody/visitation agreement. Once you have this order, you can return to the court if the biological father were to violate the agreement.The child support enforcement office in your county can help you obtain an order for child support.Below is a link to information and documents for filing a custody action.https://www.lawhelpnc.org/files/CF76DC62-D###-3###2C017826/attachments/CEEB8B8B-1528-4A8C-97F0-59062E8A02AB/custody-packet-parent.pdfI hope this helps.43858.1604166667 Ms. Bamigbade,Thank you for reaching out to NC Free Legal Answers.In North Carolina, the law presumes that your husband is the father of your child. In NC, there is no presumption that the person listed as father on the birth certificate has established paternity and legitimation nor does not give him the rights and responsibilities of parenthood.It is possible that you established paternity if you and the biological father signed an affidavit of parentage at the hospital after your son was born. Do you remember signing this document? The biological father can also establish paternity through a civil action with the courts. The biological father will also have to complete the legitimation process. In this process, he would have to present clear and convincing evidence that he is the childâ€™s natural father.If you were to marry the biological father of your son, your son would be considered legitimate without any court proceedings.Just based on the information that you have provided, it appears that your husband would be considered the father of your son under NC law.Please let me know if there is additional information that I need to consider, such as the affidavit of parentage or if there have been any court proceedings or orders.Thank you. 43856.8958333333 Yes we both signed it and he is not given any support for the child.  He told me that the boy is older now so he doesn't need too many things. He doesn't want to give any money but he wants to pick him up anytime he wants and also drop him off whenever he chooses. Does the biological father has the right to take my son from me?Am I under any obligation to tell him if I want to travel with my son or move to another location?do I deserve any child support from him?Does he have the right to pick up my son for a visit and bring him back whenever he wants?43857.075 Good Morning and thank you for looking at this. Long story short. My fiance cheated on me in September with a woman from New ###. The fiance and the woman had their affair, but the fiance broke it off before Christmas ###. The fiance made the decision that she wanted to be with me and we decided to make it work. We were trying to move forward and reconcile, however, the woman from New ### called me and threatened me to stay away from the fiance and gave verbal threats of hopping on a plane and opening a can of whoopass" down here in NC in ###19. I have video proof of the phone call and the New ### woman has continuously harassed me by sending me text after text for no reason (###) defaming the character of the fiance and just being rude and disrespectful---New ### even sent me inappropriate sexual videos of the fiance on Christmas day!! The texts lasted from ###th ### ###. The fiance has asked her repeatedly to leave us alone. The fiance has blocked her on all platforms of communication. Now it has escalated to the point where the New ### woman has sent out the fiance's inappropriate sexual videos to myself to her mother and even threatened to post them online. Neither of us had heard from the New ### woman since Christmas until ### when she sent out the sexual videos of the fiance to myself and her mother. This is also when she threatened to post them online eventually admitting she posted them online. The New ### woman sent me another sex video yesterday of the fiance. I have never responded to any of the messages. I blocked her number so she can no longer get through but I am apprehensive it will only makes things worse.The woman lives in New ### and is 65 she also has money and reach. So I do not take these threats lightly.The fiance and I both live in NC. Is there anything that can be done legally? If so what? I have screenshots of everything!What can else can I do to stay safe?

"43850.6333333333 Iâ€™m having trouble filing out the Answer and Countercliam for Child Custody.43850.6527777778 Hi ###, You can file a motion for contempt and/or a motion for an order to show cause against your ex. You can also file a motion to modify the court order if your ex is not complying with the order and ask for wage garnishment or that child support be paid in some other form (like lump sum or property). If you file a motion to modify you have to show that there has been a substantial change in circumstances (in income) since entry of the last order and you have to specifically state that in your motion. You probably want the motion for contempt and the motion to modify to be heard at the same time as the judge will be more inclined to change the child support arrangement. You do not want to delay too long as we call that sitting on your rights" in the law. The judge will question why you waited so long.  You can contact the clerk of court at your courthouse and also ask if there is a family court in your county. The clerk's office will usually be very helpful can answer your questions can help you with calendaring and can even provide you with paperwork. There is a reduced rate legal clinic in ### called "Separating Together." If you are willing to travel they are open on Thursdays and will help you draft the paperwork that you need. You can google the location for Separating Together. The easiest solution is to go to the child support enforcement agency in your county and file a child support claim with them. You may have to request a transfer of your case with the civil court to the ### court. Just let them know that you have a court order already and that you want it enforced. They can enforce your order for you and automatically do wage garnishment. They also only charge $###.

You can file at any time before the entry of divorce for alimony. If the house you live in is not in either of your names it is unlikely that you will be entitled to any of it at the time of divorce. If the titled owners will leaveit to you in their will then you would be able to receive upon their death. You would be entitled to file now for half of any property that existed when you separated that was acquired during the marriage. This is called equitable distribution.

I just found out I am due to receive a cash inheritance from my grandparents who both recently passed away.Is there a way the creditor can find out about this? Is there anyway I can protect it? Could I potentially deposit the cash into someone else's bank account(my mother's- I am not listed on the account) or would they be able to still come after it?With regards to the judgement, would it be wise to think they may settle for the amount of the original debt- $4500.00?I am interested in trying to settle the debt, I just don't want them to come and take all my inheritance before I can even try to negotiate an amount to settle on.I have attached a copy of the most recent letter regarding collection of the debt.Thanks for your time,Rachel43853.5951388889 I looked at the letter you ###.  It is just a demand from a debt collection company so it does not give a lot of information about your legal rights.  A judgment is good for ten years.  Then it can be renewed for another ten.  It would be worthwhile to go to the Courthouse to check in their computer records to see if this was renewed.  If not it will expire this year.  That means you should not give them any indication that you are interested in talking with them and hope that they let it expire in December.If it has been renewed, by all means call the collection agency and offer them pennies on the dollar to settle it.  Be sure to think about your credit.  Part of the settlement should be an agreement that they not report the payment to the credit bureaus.  The record of this debt probably does not show up on your credit report, and if it does, it will not be significant.  But, if a recent payment and write off is reported, it is all brand new and could give you a problem if you try to get credit.As to the inheritance, by all means put it quietly into your mother's account.  But think carefully about what risks there are in that course of action.  Her creditors might go after it.  Are there any family members that might get ahold of any of it?  Consider opening an account that is your mother's but has you as Pay on death."  Then don't put anything else into that account -- just your money.Lot of strategy involved!Good luck with it."43853.8291666667 The grandparents are going for full custody of my ###.They live in west ###.

Guardian ad litem is behind me.43853.34375 Dear Ms. ###,I am sorry to hear about the difficult situation you are in.  Here is some information for you to consider.You did not mention whether you have a child custody order that defines which parent has custody, what the visitation rights are, etc., so I will answer your question for either scenario.If No Child Custody OrderThe short answer is â€“ if there is no child custody order from the court (or a formal written agreement between you and your husband), you can move to Florida with your children without your husbandâ€™s permission. If You Have a Custody Order AlreadyIf you currently have a child custody order that defines which parent has custody and what the visitation schedule is, you need to go to court to modify the custody order so that it allows you to move out of state with the children.  For example, if the custody order allows your husband to see the children every other weekend, obviously that wonâ€™t be possible if you are living in Florida.  You would be in violation of the custody order if you were in Florida and the children missed their weekend visits with their father.  In this sort of circumstance, you would want the custody order modified before you moved to Florida so that visitation is during times when it would be possible for the children to see their father (for example, during summer and school breaks).No Child Custody Order (continued)Until such time as there is a child custody order or formal written agreement, either you or your husband has the equal right to relocate the children outside of North Carolina without the permission of the other parent.  Keep in mind that a childâ€™s legal residence is established by living with a parent in a state for at least six months.  If you have lived in North Carolina with the children for six months or more, the State of North Carolina has jurisdiction over child custody issues of your children until they establish legal residence elsewhere.  Once you have lived in Florida or another state with the children for at least six months, the new state becomes the childrenâ€™s legal residence, and that state has jurisdiction over deciding child custody issues. Therefore, during the first six months of your move, before you establish another state as your childrenâ€™s legal residence, North Carolina will continue to be the legal residence of your children, and the North Carolina courts will have jurisdiction over custody issues regarding your children.  So, within six months of your move, your husband can seek a temporary or emergency court order that requires you to return the children to North Carolina until a permanent child custody order is put in place that defines each parentâ€™s right to custody and visitation.  Once the children have lived in Florida (or another state) for six months, the new state becomes the childrenâ€™s new legal residence, and that new state has jurisdiction over decisions regarding custody of the children.  At that point, you should apply for custody of your children in your new state. (Note that you cannot do so until six months have passed; if you want to get a court order for custody during that first six months of living in Florida, you have to apply for custody in North Carolina)  This also means that if your husband wants to establish custody, he would have to file an action in Florida (or whatever the other state is) in order to get a court order that defines rights of custody and visitation.Keep in mind that, if your husband seeks an emergency court order for you to return the children to North Carolina, a court may not look favorably on the fact that you took the children far away from their father without his permission (even though you had the legal right to do so).  If you find yourself in that situation, you will want to show the court the reasons why you needed to move to Florida â€“ your means of support there, the lack of support from your husband while in North Carolina, your husbandâ€™s evasiveness when you tried to discuss custody issues, his unwillingness to agree to a reasonable solution, etc.  Another important factor will be the extent to which the father has been involved in the childrenâ€™s lives after you separated.  If he has shown an interest in maintaining a relationship with the children and sees them regularly, pays some type of support for them, a court is going to consider that and will attempt to establish a custody order that allows your husband regular access to the children.  This could mean requiring the children to stay in North Carolina, or it could mean allowing you to keep the children in Florida, but requiring you to return the children to North Carolina for regularly scheduled visitation (for example, during summer or school breaks).Obviously, the best solution would be for you to apply for custody of your children in North Carolina before you leave for Florida and to get formal permission from the court do to so, as this would provide certainty for you and your children.  If that is a possibility, you may want to consult with a lawyer in your area about doing that.If you need free or low-cost legal services in your area, I suggest you contact Legal Aid of North Carolina.

Before formally filing for divorce it is important to make sure (and to take some time to reflect and confirm) that this is definitely the route you want to take.  Doing some background reading and talking to a lawyer about the divorce process and the related issues is absolutely something you will want to do before proceeding.Obtaining a divorce in North Carolina (and most other states) can be a fairly lengthy and complex process.  Therefore, often (if not most) times it is best to hire a lawyer with experience in this area of the law to represent you in the proceedings themselves, and to help you navigate the process and related issues, which can include things like equitable distribution of property, alimony, child support and child custody. At a very high level, North Carolina law requires that you be separated from your spouse for at least one year and one day before you are eligible to file for divorce - this means that you and your spouse must have been living in different homes during this time and that at least one of you intended that the separation be permanent during this time.  Following the separation period, there are then several forms and papers that need to be completed and filed with the court in order to officially start the divorce proceeding, there is a filing fee that must be paid to the court and these forms and papers also then need to be served" on your spouse.  As mentioned above there are other factors that need to be considered in connection with the initial paperwork and the divorce proceedings themselves such as equitable distribution of property alimony child support and child custody all of which a lawyer with experience in this area that you can engage should be able to give you more details and advise around and assist you with deciding how best to address these issues.Here is a link (###) to an overview of the separation and divorce process in North Carolina from the North Carolina Courts website which itself includes helpful links to other materials and resources (such as the North Carolina Divorce Packet prepared by the North Carolina Equal Access to Justice Commission (https://www.nccourts.gov/help-topics/divorce/north-carolina-divorce-packet) which likewise contains links and telephone numbers to the North Carolina Lawyer Referral Service (which you can use to help find a lawyer who specializes in divorce in your area) and Legal Aid of North Carolina (which if you can't afford a lawyer you can use to see if you are eligible for free advice or assistance from a lawyer)).

There could be a child support provision in your separation agreement, or there could be a separate child support order.  If such an order exists, you must pay it.  If there was never a court order for you to pay child support, then you are not under an obligation to pay the child support.With that being said this can change.  Your ex-wife can go to court in an attempt to obtain a child support order.  Until she does so and presents you with an order, you are not obligated to pay child support.  An informal demand like the one you are describing does not impose a child support obligation.Best of luck.43894.8506944444 I also have carried her shopping when she visited and give money on multiple occasions when needed voluntarily.43857.6930555556 I am divorced on the divorce papers it stated my daughter lives with me and nothing on child support.

In that case, you will need to modify that custody order.  Since the children's father has been convicted of assault charges, it looks like you have proper grounds to file for an emergency modification order.I attached to this message an emergency modification of custody form.  You should file it in whatever county the original order you are seeking to modify was in.  I understand that this form may not be the correct county, but just modify the heading to whatever jurisdiction you need to file it in.I also attached some general instructions on seeking modification of a custody order to assist you in better understanding the overall process.Best of luck.43864.7166666667 On nov. 13th my ex filed an ex-parte dvo against me and placed my kids under that order.

I want this over with. Help me. What do I do?43857.1597222222 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for this very important question.  I first of all extend my sincere, heartfelt support to you given what you have discovered; I know that trust is very hard to create and maintain in this life, and a broken heart is among the most serious injuries any of us can experience.  God bless you, your husband and your kids as you heal and work through this.Based on what you have described here, there are two (###000652) possible lawsuits or causes of action: first, criminal conversation, and second, alienation of affections.  I will describe both below in brief.Criminal conversation is a civil wrong that accrues to a married plaintiff when a third party has had sexual relations with his/her spouse.  It does not matter whether the third party's adulterous activity leads to the couple divorcing or reconciling after the affair is over; all that needs to be established is the third party's sexual relations with the married spouse.  This can be proven directly, or through very strong circumstantial evidence, by which a jury could deduce or infer that a sexual relationship did occur.  If you are interested in pursuing this claim, you would hire a family law attorney, or a general civil litigation attorney, to file a lawsuit against the paramour.Alienation of affections is closely related to criminal conversation, and is often sued for at the same time, in the same lawsuit.  HOWEVER, alienation of affections, unlike criminal conversation, requires that you actually divorce in order for the claim to be upheld.  Here is why: the elements of this second claim include (###000###87) the existence of a marriage, (###000652) in which there was genuine (if not perfect) love and affection within such marriage, (###) intentionally interfered with by a third party, (###) thereby destroying" or "alienating" the affections in the marriage.  So far we have elements (###000###87) (###000652) and (###) but proving (###) would mean that as a result of the affair your affections were destroyed which would need to be evidenced by a divorce.  If you remain married the legal presumption would be that while your affections have been damaged they have not been fully alienated or destroyed.  That would then leave you only with the claim of criminal conversation.You can normally ask for punitive damages and compensatory damages which could be a substantial monetary judgment win assuming the defendant has the financial means to pay the judgment.  If not you would have the right to enforce the judgment against the person's current and future assets (subject to certain statutory exemptions for living necessities pensions some real estate equity and other essentials) for ten years subject to renewal for a second ten-year ###.  This would ruin the defendant's credit but if the defendant does not otherwise have assets or cash out of which to pay a judgment you would likely not recover anything worth the money you would have to spend upfront to pursue a lawsuit.  Some lawyers might take this on a partial contingency basis but few would do this on a pure contingency basis.This gives you a general idea of what claims and rights you can pursue based on the facts.  Preserve all evidence you have just in case you decide to pursue this anytime within the three-year statute of limitations period (for both claims which begins to tick upon the defendant's last bad act).Reach out to local family law or civil litigation counsel if interested in a consultation to discuss the details of these two claims further.Blessings to you and your family in ###0006520###0006520."43857.9243055556 My husband and I been marry for almost ###  we have two kids together and we been living together including now.

At this point you need to file an answer, and if you wish to contest custody, a counter claim.  I've attached some instructions and forms to help you through this process. This service will only allow me to attach smaller files, so I attached the main one and will try to send you an additional message.Best of luck.43860.93125 Hi. My issue is that my kids father took out custody papers on me before I could get the chance to this following week and I need to know how to go about it. He has kept them from me for a whole year and my kids as well as I receive benefits from DSS and I kept them going the past year because I was trying to look out for my kids well being because their father can't keep a job. I left because of him putting his hands on me constantly and in front of my kids. I left my kids there because I don't have any family and I didn't have anywhere to go. So for their safety and well being I left them there until I could get my life together. While I have been gone he has constantly said that I couldn't see them until I decided to work things out with him and since I left he has not taken them to the doctor once. I have my children now and they have told me many things like he would punch them in the chest and in the stomach when they got in trouble and giving them medicine to make them go to sleep. Since I took my children from him. He decided to take out custody papers on me. What would be my next step in this process? 43857.6729166667 My ex and I have been separated for ###. We have never gone before a judge but we have a family court date on ###. He claims he does not have any income and lies to his lawyer about finances.

He owns several properties and investment accounts, but my name is not on them. We were married for ###. It has been ### ###.

Will the judge make him pay child support if he claims he has no income? 43857.7493055556 Hi ###,You typically have ###. So whenever you received service of this complaint plus ###.I wouldn't be too concerned about the damages language used by the plaintiff. That is standard language included in most complaints. If the plaintiff was looking for a specific kind of damages, plaintiff would say so in the complaint.  So read the complaint carefully to make sure plaintiff does not ask for any specific damages that you disagree with.In terms of whether you file an answer, that is really up to you. Typically a divorce petition will include requests for a distribution of marital property and also contain child custody, visitation and support requests if there are children from the marriage. If an answer is not filed within ###, the matter will then be set for a hearing where the judge can issue a final decree of divorce.It sounds like from your message that you agree with everything in the complaint, except for that last item.  If that's the case, you may not need to file a response and can instead choose to just attend the hearing set by the judge.If you decide you would like to respond, I would recommend that you go to the clerk's office in the courthouse where the complaint was filed. They usually have blank forms that you can use to write out your response.Best of luck.43864.6715277778 Thank you for that information. 43865.1361111111 states- To award ### (my ex) such other and further relief to which he is entitled under the laws of the state of North Carolina and the Court deems just and proper.He, my ex The Plaintiff, ### up this document himself since heâ€™s representing himself.

Depending on the specific facts of your husband's conduct, you may be able to file in ### District Court for what is called a divorce from bed and board"--in effect a judicially determined separation.  Here are the enumerated grounds under which this can be sought per the applicable statute N.C.### Â§ ###:"The court may grant divorces from bed and board on application of the party injured madeas by law provided in the following cases if either party:(1) Abandons his or her family.(2) Maliciously turns the other out of doors.(3) By cruel or barbarous treatment endangers the life of the other. In additionthe court may grant the victim of such treatment the remedies availableunder ### ### et seq.(4) Offers such indignities to the person of the other as to render his or hercondition intolerable and life burdensome.(5) Becomes an excessive user of alcohol or drugs so as to render the conditionof the other spouse intolerable and the life of that spouse burdensome.(6) Commits adultery."If the worst thing your husband does is argue aggressively and drink excessively that by itself is probably not enough to prevail for a judicially determined separation.  If there has been physical violence abuse one of the above-enumerated items however you could likely not only establish through the court a date of separation for purposes of starting the one-year interim period before divorce (which would likely begin on the day the judge si###the order unless the judge is willing to backdate it) but could also likely have the judge order the husband to leave the marital home for the time between then and the divorce (with the division of the home to be worked out later either through a separation agreement or through equitable distribution proceedings before the court).To do this effectively you will likely need an experienced family law attorney as this would be very difficult to do on one's own (though possible if you put in the time; some courthouses even offer self-help filing packets so you can check to see if this is so in family court at the ### County Courthouse).### "Find a Lawyer" search function can help you search among local practitioners in and around ### and you can also contact the ### County Bar and ask for a referral (see link below).https://www.meckbar.org/index.cfm?pg=LRS-homeI hope this helps somewhat in squaring your options and game plan.

If you don't show up, you aren't giving the judge an opportunity to hear your point of view and your side of the story, so attending such a hearing is always encouraged.  If you don't have the means to take care of your kids at this time, but would like to in the future, you can tell the court that.Also, whatever the court decides and whatever custody order is issued, it could be changed in the future.  If you have a material change in your life at some point, you could go back to the court and request a modification to the custody order.Best of luck.43864.8270833333 I have an upcoming court date to discuss temporary child custody on ###.

This is a confusing situation that will require a local real estate lawyer in ### County to review in detail in order to clear up, one way or another.  What a lawyer would need to know is whether you and your deceased son were joint tenants with rights of survivorship or joint tenants in common."  If the first then you would have absorbed your deceased son's interest immediately upon his death with you owning 100% of the land assuming that only you and the deceased son were on the deed as 50-###.If "joint tenants in common your deceased son's interest does not automatically come to you, but would be the inheritance of his heirs (if no will) or his beneficiaries (if he had a will).  His automatic heirs would include his spouse and children if he died married and having children of his own.  Otherwise, it would be you as the surviving parent.  Depending on what your deceased son's personal situation was at death, this scenario could go in any number of directions.  That is why spea### in person with a ### County probate or real estate lawyer will be necessary if you want to precisely get to the bottom of this matter.  We can offer you a few general points of reference on this website, but we are too far removed from the details to offer you a definite answer to these questions.  However, thankfully, these questions can be shortly resolved as long as you have a local lawyer studying this closely.Whether you can undo the deed transfer that your living son led you into depends on whether your son lied to you or committed fraud in order to get you to sign.  If he did either of these, a local lawyer could help you correct the transfer or else sue your son.  If neither fraud nor deception was involved, and you merely ### your decisions upon second thought, there is probably not much you can do at this point.Contact a couple lawyers in ### or other towns in ### County, and see what they would charge for a ### consultation to discuss the facts of this situation.  I am sure that by the time you have had an hour with a lawyer, you will better understand your rights and what, if anything, needs to be done at this point.God bless you and your family in ###.43864.7458333333 my oldest son was on my property ### he passed away suddenly then as soon as my sons death ### came my other son came and stayed ###'s care for shock and depression at the time  it wasnt even ###43862.1458333333 Dear Ms. ###,Yes, itâ€™s true that under North Carolina law, if the mother was married at the time of either ### or birth, or between ### and birth, the husband is presumed to be the legal father of the child, and his name must be entered on the certificate as the father of the child. N.C.G.S. 130A-101(e) (attached).There is a procedure to change the name of the father on the birth certificate, provided you give evidence that someone else is the father. If you want to remove the name of your ex-husband from the birth certificate and leave it blank, it probably will require you to prove that your ex-husband is not the father.There are implications of removing your ex-husband from the birth certificate. One is that you will lose the right to seek child support from him. I assume from your question that you are not interested in receiving child support from him, but I mention this so you are aware of the consequences. The other implication is that your child will lose his/her right to inherit from your ex-husband (assuming he does not leave a will in which he excludes your child, in which case your child cannot inherit from him regardless). You may have decided that, as a practical matter, this is not important to your child (because, for example, you donâ€™t expect there will be anything to inherit). But again, I mention it so you understand the consequences to your child down the road.You say that you want to leave the information for the father blank on your childâ€™s birth certificate. I assume this means you either do not know who the biological father is or you do not want him listed, either. Again, if you remove your ex-husband from the birth certificate but do not replace the name with the natural father, your child will not have a legal father for purposes of inheritance or other rights related to a parent-child relationship.I am looking into the specific procedures you need to follow, should you decide to remove your ex-husband from your childâ€™s birth certificate. I will respond with more details shortly.Regards,Linda43870.7604166667 When I gave birth ### ###. The nurse came in and told me since I was legally still married his name would have to go on the certificate. Is this right? Like to take his name off and leave that part blank. What do I do43864.6125 Hi ###,Thanks for asking your question.  I am sorry to hear that you are in this situation.Since your estranged husband does not have a permanent address, you will most likely have to pay a fee for the sheriff to personally serve him with the documents. If they are not able to locate him, you may be able to serve him by publishing the information in a newspaper. However, this takes time and should be your last resort. You must have the other documents in order for the sheriff to serve him. To see what other documents you would need to gather, visit: https://www.nccourts.gov/assets/inline-files/NC-Divorce-Packet-V1-1-Sept-2019_0.pdf#page=13 & ###.Hope you are able to do this and that this information is helpful.Take care43872.7479166667 I have been separated from my husband for ###. It would be a simple divorce, no children, property or possessions involved. My problem is my estranged husband has no permanent address and I do not know where he is located. I do have a phone number for him but he refuses to speak to me. I am not sure if he is even employed. How do I move forward filing for a divorce without an address for him? Thank you43864.6451388889 Dear Ms. ###,I am looking into your question about your child's birth certificate.  From what I have seen, your ex-husband may be presumed under the law to be the father of your child if she was born within a certain period of time after the divorce.  What that time period is in NC is not entirely clear yet.  I do not believe it is defined by statute, so I need to look for other guidance.  Can you please provide me a few more details to help me nail down the answer?###.  On what date was your divorce finalized?###.  What is your child's birth date?###.  At which hospital was your child born? (specific name and county)###.  Was it the hospital that issued the birth certificate? (it sounds like it was from what you have explained)5.  Did the hospital say anything to you about the date of your divorce and the date of your child's birth?  Meaning, did they say they could only list your ex-husband's name on the birth certificate because your divorce had only been final a short period of time before the baby was born?  Did they tell you what that time period was (for example, ###)?  I'm trying to understand what the hospital believed the law to be.  If you don't know or remember what they told you, one of us can call the hospital to ask.If you can answer these questions, we can get a little closer to understanding what the status of your child is -- which will determine the type of procedure you need to follow to get her biological father's name on the birth certificate.I look forward to hearing from you.Regards,Linda43867.7069444444 How do I get my (now) Husband (and biological father) to our child on her birth certificate. back story: I was previously married and separated for two years . My ex wouldnâ€™t pay for the divorce so I had to save up and pay for it alone. During this period I met my know husband and we conceived our daughter (before the divorce was final). However the divorce was finalized before she was born. The hospital said we HAD to put fathers information refused on the birth certificate since I was â€œlegally marriedâ€ when she was conceived & had not yet married my now husband. We donâ€™t have a ton of money to hire a lawyer to be able to have â€œfathers information refusedâ€ removed from her birth certificate. What can we do ??? We have been to our local court house and everyone just simply says â€œget a lawyerâ€ when we are not in a financial place to do so. My husband is an amazing father and just wants to be on his daughters birth certificate. 43864.7375 Ms. ###,I am adding two more questions for you to answer:6.  What was the date of your separation from your ex-husband?  Please give the date that you provided on your petition for divorce.7.  What was the date that you filed your petition for divorce? (i.e., the date that you submitted it to the court)Thanks,Linda43867.7694444444 Ms. ###,I have some additional resources for you where you can get free advice on the procedures for establishing your husband's paternity for your daughter.The North Carolina Child Support Services (CSS) often handle issues of establishing paternity when a mother is seeking child support.  Therefore, they are very familiar with the legal procedures required.  Even though you are not seeking child support, you may want to contact your local CSS office to get free advice on how to file the Affidavit of Parentage and other papers for establishing paternity.Their general website is here:  https://www.ncchildsupport.com/ecoa/.The local CSS office in ### County is here.  If ### County is not the right county for you, you can search for a CSS office near you on the website above.NC ### County Child Support Enforcement Agency###, NC 27577Contact: ### JerniganTel: ###-###On the CSS website, they have a Child Support Handbook, which I am attaching here.  Starting on p. 14, they have a discussion about establishing paternity.  On p. 15, there is this Q&A:Q: I was married when my child was born; however, my husband is not the childâ€™s father. How do I go about establishing paternity?A: Both the biological father and legal father may be needed to legally establish paternity. By law, the motherâ€™s husband is considered the father of a child until there is a court order stating otherwise. Your local CSS agency will seek appropriate legal advice to determine the appropriate action necessary.Let me know if you have any questions.Regards,Linda43867.9590277778 Ms. ###,Please disregard my previous messages with the questions that I asked, since I no longer need that information.  I believe I have the answers for you here.Under NC law, it is true that if you have conceived a child while married, the husband is presumed to be the legal father of the child (and his name must go on the birth certificate), unless you take certain steps to have the natural father established as the legal father.  I am attaching the statute that applies here (N.C.G.S. Â§ ###30A-###0###(e)).The statute lays out the procedure for establishing your current husband as the legal father of your child.  It looks like you can do this yourself without the help of an attorney by filing the appropriate paperwork with the local Register of Deeds and the N.C. Vital Records division.  See paragraph (e)(###) of the attached statute.The forms you need include the Affidavit of Parentage (attached), completed by you and your current husband and signed in front of a notary.It appears you may also need to have a DNA test done by your current husband and attach those test results to your Affidavit of Parentage.The statute also requires an affidavit from your ex-husband consenting to the assertion of paternity by your current husband.  However, the Affidavit of Parentage does not provide a section for this.  It's possible that the DNA test results would be sufficient without consent of the ex-husband. The form for changing your daughter's birth certificate is the Request to Amend a Record (attached).  Where to File the Forms:###.  Affidavit of Parentage:  The statute suggests that you file the Affidavit of Parentage with your local Register of Deeds.  Your profile says you are in ### County.  If that is where your daughter was born, here is the website for that office:  http://www.###nc.com/rod/. If not, just Google register of deeds" and the name of the county where your daughter was born and use that office.  I suggest calling the Register of Deeds to speak to someone who can confirm the procedure for filing these forms.###.  Request to Amend a Record (i.e. birth certificate):  Mail this form along with the required form of payment and copy of your ID to the address on the form.  Once they receive it they will contact you for further information -- which may include your Affidavit of Parentage DNA test results etc.If you find that you are not getting the answers you need on how to file these forms correctly let me know and I will see if I can get some clarity for you.Let me know if you have any questions.RegardsLinda"43867.8826388889 Thank you SO much for all of your help !!!! This information is so helpful 43877.09375 You are very welcome.  Please let me know if you run into any problems or have additional questions.Regards,Linda43877.7083333333 It depends on what is being filed against you.   If there is a motion for contempt being filed,  then the idea is compliance with the order or punishment for non compliance.   The opposition would have to prove you're willfully and deliberately failing to pay your alimony award.   They can look to see how you're spending money on yourself and whether there are assets to liquidate.  Before you are sent to jail,  the court must advise you of your right to counsel.  If you cannot afford an attorney, one can still be appointed to you in contempt cases. Accept that and get legal advice from local counsel.   43873.0076388889 if I donâ€™t have the money to pay alimony will I go to jail?43865.5791666667 I would suggest contacting the authorities in the county and file a missing person report. You can also contact Social Services and file a report in the last known county. Once you get a valid address you need to seek counsel to file an Emergency Motion for Custody/Visitation. You have to use strategy. Because they are not stable as soon as you find them you need to hire counsel to file for emergency custody. 43928.9854166667 My name is ###. I have a ###.

You and your spouse can sell, gift or otherwise dispose of any assets that are SEPARATE property in whatever way you wish.  This would principally include property that (###) you two brought to the marriage, or (###) inherited or was gifted in your individual names, by third parties outside the marriage.  Anything acquired during your marriage should be approached far more cautiously, unless there is a certificate of title, deed, or some other legal written instrument that signifies ### that you or your husband own such property ONLY as an individual, and not jointly with your spouse.  Otherwise, it is a safe assumption that everything else will need to be split up either under the terms of a written separation agreement (notarized and signed by both parties), or through an equitable distribution proceeding in District Court, as part of the overall divorce proceedings.I recommend you and your husband hammering out the essential terms if at all possible, and then having a local family law attorney for one of you draft it, with review/comment from the other side and his/her attorney, before you two sign and have the agreement notarized.  If not, once the divorce is filed, one of you will need to make a motion for equitable distribution, and the court will then hear the situation and divide up the assets according to what the judge believes is equitable, based on common law and statutory standards of North Carolina divorce law.God bless you and your family this new year, and I give you my best wishes as you work through all the steps of this important transition in your life.  Be well, and take things a day at a time, even with the long-term vision in view.43866.9055555556 me and my husband just separated can he sell off items in his name for a dollar to our son and then get it back after the divorce 43866.7923611111 Good evening, Ms. Desantiago:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  I noticed that no other lawyer had yet responded to your question from last month, so I wanted to briefly respond with some points to consider.  Yes, if you are contemplating divorce, proof of unsanctioned adultery (and other serious marital misconduct) is grounds for alimony.  Alimony is mostly ###, but can also be awarded upon a compelling showing in court that one spouse is heavily dependent on the other spouse for maintenance and support, especially when the dependent spouse has had more or most of the child-rearing duties.  So I think you have two strong grounds for alimony, or at the very least two based on what you wrote here: (###) the existence of an adulterous relationship you did not approve or sanction, and (###) your staying at home to raise the children of your marriage.At some point, you will need to hire a family law attorney if you hope to make the best case to the ### County District Court judge for alimony.  While the spouses in a divorce action can, at the time of legal separation, agree on terms like property settlement/division and post-separation support in a written (and notarized) separation agreement, if the spouses are not otherwise willing or able to resolve differences over these matters, they can seek the desired relief by filing a series of appropriate motions, and preparing for trial on the merits as the divorce lawsuit proceeds over several months.  While it is not impossible for a non-lawyer to do this alone, it is exceedingly difficult to do well.If you are contemplating or have already begun separation, think over your steps carefully and see if one of the local ### County lawyers can represent you.  They will know how to take the matter on from here.Best wishes to you this spring, and blessings to you and your kids.43920.15625 I was a stayed at home mom and he was the person who work.

You need to file a request for spousal support and for equitable distribution.  If your claim survives divorce, then you can certainly mediate both issues.

You have raised some compelling questions here, which I enjoy tackling as an estate planning lawyer.  Based on your parents' situation, and assuming that your parents share the goals of ### formal probate proceedings upon their deaths, I recommend the following instruments (drafted by lawyers with experience in estate planning and elder law, and not mere forms or templates, which will cause you more problems than not, as they are not drafted by NC-counsel with knowledge of the client's specific circumstances):(###) each parent should sign a durable (general) power of attorney, designating each other as their agent with you serving as the alternate if/when one spouse is unable to serve in such capacity;(###) each parent should sign a healthcare power of attorney (with living will and advance directive language incorporated therein), designating the other spouse as the healthcare agent, with you serving as the secondary if/when one spouse cannot serve in such capacity (and these should be accompanied by HIPPA releases);(###) the parents should jointly sign either a revocable trust (if they have a long enough life expectancy where they are likely to be able to manage their own affairs for at least ten (###0) more years, or an irrevocable trust (much more rigid in terms of being able to drastically change or revoke it, and should not be used unless life expectancy is not more than ten years, and finances are relatively stable and predictable enough to forecast through what is likely to remain of their lives).With respect to the trust, anything that is placed into it would not be a probate asset, and would not be subject to the local jurisdiction of the Clerk of Superior Court, acting as judge of probate in this matter.  The trust can include provisions for how payments of SS and disability income should be treated, as well as to which beneficiaries the property goes as of the death of the last parent/spouse.  If Medicaid asset planning is part of your family's concerns, you can also discuss with your lawyer whether, in addition to the items I enumerated above, your lawyer should also add mechanisms like ### life estate deeds, deeds with rights of survivorship, and POD and other death benefit designations in favor of specific beneficiaries, in order to make your parents eligible for Medicaid long-term care should they ever need it, while still not jeopardizing their assets (eventually to be your and your adopted sibling's inheritance, in the best of possible ###) should they run out of means, or lack the ability physically, to live on their own at home.Any lawyer with at least four (###) years of intensive estate planning and elder law experience can help you with a comprehensive plan such as this.  Your family can reasonably expect to pay somewhere between $###,### $###,###, depending on what specific things might or might not be included.  ### Find a Lawyer" feature can help you research local lawyers to determine who might be good potential fits for your family's needs among North Carolina lawyers.

Unfortunately at this time North Carolina does not allow for an unmarried partner to adopt. The state only recognizes step-parent adoptions at this time. Depending on when you and your fiance get married you can wait ###. Since your fiance will consent and particularly in light of the fact that the mother's parental rights have already been terminated this should be a relatively easy process. My advice is, if it can wait until you are married for six months then you can adopt and your ### will have all of the same legal rights then as if they were your own. This would make them your children and they can inherit from you and have other legal rights which come with being adopted. If the children are under the age of ### ###, then I would encourage you to consult with an attorney regarding the children and their well being. Since you are not married to their father it may be better for him to execute a document ### you as guardian of the children in the event something happens to him in which he cannot care for the children (e.g. coma, hospital stay, etc.). Then upon the ### of that event you would file for guardianship. But a guardian is not usually appointed until neither of the biological parents are available. Similarly, you aren't attempting to take away custody of the children from their father, so a custody hearing is likely not the right response.If it can wait until ###, then I would recommend you adopt the children. There are several rules regarding this, but given that their mother's rights are already terminated and their father will consent, this likely will not be a major issue.I hope this helps.Best,###43927.8395833333 My fiance kids live with us I am for all but legally the mom in our family. Due to health related issues with my fiance,  I am looking into legal aspects of the situation with the children. I need to be able to provide insurance for them. Their biological mother's rights have already been terminated. Can I adopt without us not being married or would custody or guardianship be a quicker option? Also can any of these be done without a lawyer?43867.8645833333 I was in a relationship for almost ###. At first my ex kept pushing for me to get an abortion. He said we were not ready, but I did not want to abort. Even after going with me to my ultrasound appointment at ###. After seeing, with his own eyes, the baby on the screen, knowing the gender, he still communicated to me that he wanted me to have an abortion. But a little while later he agreed to move in with me, he got a dog, and we were making plans to build a life together. Halfway through my pregnancy my ex started to have doubts again and eventually left. I asked him to make arrangements for his dog which he did not do, therefore leaving me, pregnant, having to find his Husky a home. I never received any word from him after ### about our situation. He disappeared from my life without a word, blocked me and my family on social media, even got into a relationship two weeks after he stopped talking to me. Early on in my pregnancy I had told him that he had several options on how he wanted to proceed, we could stay in a relationship and raise this child, we could end our relationship and co-parent in a civil manner, or he could sign his rights away. He never gave me an answer as to how he wanted to proceed with our situation. Since I had't heard from him I accepted being a single parent, utilizing my resources, ### myself, attending classes and appointments, talking with other Mothers, and making sure I did what I was supposed to do for my baby by keeping my health in check. From August I hadn't heard from him until Dec. 29, ###. 14, ### ### hey" and that was all. I never received any word from him regarding how I was doing during the part of my pregnancy when he was not involved not to check up on me or the baby. I am solely ### and I have support from my family. I recently received a letter from an attorney on his behalf in the mail regarding wanting to pursue a paternity test establish visitation and pay child support. What legal options do I have? What ways could this play out? I would possibly agree to him establishing paternity but considering the circumstances I do not agree giving him any visitation. Is it possible to deny him visitation? If I am taken to court would I have a decent case against him so that he could not acquire visitation or custody of my child? My family previously used the attorney that he had send me the letter. Can this be a conflict of interest since the attorney has represented my family in other cases?"43868.8701388889 You should probably consult with a private attorney and/or schedule a low cost consultation through the North Carolina Lawyer Referral Service.  You may also want to speak with Child Support Enforcement in your county to see if you qualify for services regarding the paternity and child support.  You are not required to respond to a letter from an attorney but not responding will likely lead to the filing of a lawsuit that you will have to respond to.  If the matter proceeds through court you will have an opportunity to formally answer and present evidence at a hearing before a judge, and you may have to attend custody mediation as well.  It is not clear when your child was born but I am assuming after ### based on your email.  You may wish to speak with an attorney about whether there are any grounds to terminate parental rights, but just because there are grounds does not mean a judge will find termination to be in a child's best interests, and that is a whole separate court action under a whole set of different statutes.  Child custody will be based on the child's best interests, and his lack of engagement/involvement/support will definitely be taken into account in terms of a determination of custody.  Child support will be based on the physical custody schedule and your respective gross incomes.  In terms of the potential attorney conflict, unless the attorney directly represented you and/or has information from the course of representing your family that directly bears on the issues surrounding your child, it is likely not a conflict of interest in the technical sense.  If you believe it is a conflict you can raise it in your response to the lawyer.  I strongly encourage you to seek legal counsel to fully explore the issues and how and whether you should respond, file your own action, etc.  Best of luck.43921.0916666667 Good evening, Mr. ###:Very glad you thought to post this question on NC Free Legal Answers.  Unfortunately, this is not duress" within the legal meaning for purposes of ### a contract in which one party was illegally coerced.  Threatening legal action against someone is not illegal especially if there is a reason for recourse to the courts--as there always is when spouses who are contemplating divorce do not or cannot agree on terms of separation and property division (that recourse is a Motion for Equitable Distribution as part of a divorce lawsuit).  As long as the party threatening legal action has at least the ### appearance of a legal claim or cause for legal relief (even if it does not ultimately succeed in court) the threat is legal and is not duress.  It appears here instead that your ex-wife simply played hardball and drove a hard bargain that benefited her (and she may have taken advantage of the fact that you two did not have lawyers).  You can try suing in District Court to have the agreement rescinded but it will be very hard to convince the judge to do so based on what I have written here.  While testimony and emails (or texts) would be helpful if all your ex-wife did was play hardball that by itself is not duress within the legal meaning and remember that your wife can always counter that you could have hired a lawyer to push back on her demands (even if you did not have funds to pay a lawyer for long-term representation).Examples of duress would be "improper threats" such as the threat of violence or threat of other types of harm to one's person or material interests which in and of themselves are illegal.  Lawsuits can be threatened as long as there is some legitimate basis for them--as there was in this situation since marital rights were at the heart of your disagreements before the agreement was signed.Thus assuming this separation agreement was signed by both parties and notarized by a notary judge magistrate or courthouse clerk it will be presumed legal and enforceable absent some compelling reason to rule otherwise.  You still have the right to take this matter to court if you really wish to but understand the barriers to your success.I can understand why you feel as you have written as "duress" is often used in a manner by non-lawyers that is very different from the legal definition that lawyers and judges know well.  From a purely personal perspective I can see why you felt that you had little to no choice but to sign in order to avoid the burden and legal fees of legal action should your ex-wife had followed through on her threat.

We both signed an unincorporated separation agreement on ### that was drawn up by my ex-wife. BEFORE signing the agreement my ex-wife sent me the separation agreement by email which was very one sided and I refused to sign it.  She modified the agreement and sent it to me again ... again, I refused to sign the agreement because it was so one sided.  This went on for one month and she sent me about ###, but still very one sided.  Finally, the last modified agreement she sent me she Included this statement in the email.. If you don't sign this agreement I am going to seeking legal action and consuel."  Thus threatening me with "legal proceedings"  I of course was scared and didn't want that so I signed the agreement.  Its only years later that I have found out that she cannot force me to sign an agreement or at least that is what I have read.   My questions are ###. If she threatened me with "legal proceedings" to get me to sign the agreement isn't that grounds for having the contract voided? vacated? overturned?  ??  ###.  Is her testimony in court enough to overturn or void the agreement or would I need those emails?  I know she would admit to threatening me with "legal proceedings".  ###. She also states in the separation agreement to return certain personal property items of mine to me once I sign the agreement.. Isn't that also Duress? forcing me to sign an agreement to get my personal property back. The items themselves are ### but It's literally stated right on the first page of the agreement. "Each spouse keeps what he or she has with the exception of ### returning the following items on the date this separation agreement is signed"  That is force corect?  I need help in voiding this separation agreement."43870.8743055556 ###,It sounds like you have a separation agreement that speaks to decisions you and your children's mother made regarding the upbringing of the children. A separation agreement is a contract between you and the children's mother. A separation is not valid in North Carolina unless both parties have signed and had their signatures notarized. Additionally, to be valid the agreement must be signed or after the parties' separation. Terms within the agreement concerning the children and the children's welfare are always modifiable by the court. If you believe that the provisions within the separation agreement pertaining to the custody of the children or their welfare need to be modified, then you can seek further involvement of the court for the best interest of the child.As I understand your situation, you believe that your children's mother is violating a portion of the separation agreement. Particularly, you believe that she is allowing her boyfriends to be with the children within her first six months of dating that individual (which is contrary to the separation agreement arrangements). Assuming that your separation agreement is valid (it was signed and notarized by both parties), you can file a lawsuit for breach of contract if you believe any of its provisions were violated. You can not file a breach of contract action however if the separation agreement was incorporated into a divorce decree (which based on the facts you gave, was not the case).  Remedies you could seek in a breach of contract action could include an order from the court directing your children's mother to act in accordance with that provision. Conversely, if your separation agreement was incorporated into a divorce decree, then you could move for contempt of court.Your separation agreement may include a clause allowing the court to award expenses and attorney's fees to the party who has to bring an action enforcing the agreement. So, it is a good idea to read your separation agreement closely.It also appears that you really believe that the new significant other of your children's mother is someone that you do not want to be around your children. If there is no court order determining who has custody of the children, each parent has an equal right to live with the child. If you all cannot work out amongst yourselves how the children will split their time between you and the children's mother, then it may become necessary to bring a formal custody action in court. In North Carolina, to settle custody for your children (so long as the child has lived in NC for ###, the child must have lived in NC for at least six months prior to you bringing the custody action. Custody will be awarded based on something called the best interest" standard. In other words what arrangements will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. Who your children's mother decides to have around her children that person's character and that person's record are likely factors considered by the courts when making a custody determination. Additionally the living conditions of the children are also factors to be considered. Really it  boils down to what the court believes is in the best interest of the child given the totality of the circumstances.I believe this addresses the concerns you raised let me know.###"43921.8486111111 If a woman is dating a man with past child abuse charges from ###, and hasn't been convicted of any other crimes can the father countersue or do anything legal against the mother to get full custody of the children because he just doesn't want the mothers boyfriend around the kids.

If the child is primarily with one parent such that the other parent has less than ###, the other parent will pay child support to the primary custodial parent.  If the other parent has more than ###, child support may still be owed but on a Worksheet B which takes into account the support each has to provide in their respective care.  Under a Worksheet A or B calculation, the obligation will also depend on gross incomes, health insurance, work related childcare, and possibly extraordinary expenses.  NC Child Support Enforcement website has worksheets you can run online to get an idea as well as the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines.  43920.1548611111 If you are talking about applying for full custody, that is via a complaint and civil summons filed in the district court of the county where you reside.  There may be local family court rules.  You may need to hire a private attorney or schedule a more detailed consult with one to understand the process fully, but after you file the complaint and have the clerk issue a civil summons, your son's other parent would need to be personally served with both documents, by sheriff or certified mail, and then the other parent would have a period of time to answer your complaint.  You will probably have to attend custody mediation in an attempt to work it out before having a hearing before a judge when you would each have an opportunity to present evidence regarding your son's circumstances and best interests and parental fitness.  You can schedule a low cost consultation through the North Carolina Lawyer Referral Service, and some local Legal Aid offices have online videos about child custody and the process.

Real estate passes to the heirs as of the decedent's date of death, and other property must actually be distributed to the heirs by an administrator" (similar to an executor) typically appointed by the Clerk of Court in the county where your ### lived at her time of death.Family Tree/Determining HeirsYou have provided that she is your ### your three sons are her only blood relatives and there was a husband at some point from whom she received guns. Please help me understand her family tree a little better:Describe her family tree starting with her parents. Did she have any siblings? No children of her own?Can you confirm that her parents grandparents and siblings have all predeceased?Was she unmarried as of her date of death?If not was she widowed? Divorced? What was her relationship to the husband from whom she received the guns?Was she the sister of your ex-husband?Opening an Estate and Appointing an AdministratorOnce her "heirs" have been determined those heirs need to decide whether to open an Estate and if so what type of Estate to open. Typically when there is real estate a "full estate" should be opened with the Clerk of Court typically in the county where she was living when she passed away. All of the heirs also have an equal right to open an Estate and qualify as the Administrator (again similar to an Executor) of her Estate a position which would allow/require the ### to collect all of her assets pay all of her debts to the extent there are assets in the Estate to do so and distribute any remaining assets equally among the heirs.Real EstateAs I mentioned above the real estate (the house and "quite a bit of land" you mentioned) passed to the heirs as of her date of death. So did the tax ### and all expenses of maintaining the house. So if your sons are the heirs then all three of them own the land together and are equally responsible for the related ###s. They might also decide there should be some rent due from the current occupant of the house. It is common for co-owners of land to require the current occupant to pay utilities similar to a renter but the tax ### is typically paid by the owners (i.e. the heirs). Note that if the deceased had debts exceeding the non-real estate assets available then the real estate might need to be sold to pay those debts.Personal PropertyPersonal property is everything that isn't real estate. In addition to bank accounts it includes the guns and farming equipment you mentioned as well as household furniture and goods clothes jewelry cars.Tangible personal property - If your middle son has already taken some of her assets he may have to give them back or have them counted as part of his inheritance assuming he is determined to be an "heir" of her Estate. It is certainly not something that should be done without the appropriate court authority. If your sons are the only heirs then it might just come down to whether they all are ok with what he is done as long as the entire estate can inevitably be settled in accordance with law (i.e. all creditors and debts paid and the remaining assets distributed equally between all heirs).Bank accounts - Unless she had a joint owner or payable on death beneficiary named on her bank accounts someone will have to be appointed by the Clerk to collect those accounts.Insurance - Do you know who the insurance policy is with or whether there are beneficiaries named? Typically insurance is payable to a named beneficiary. If that is the case the named beneficiary can contact the insurance company to inquire about how to collect the proceeds. Different companies have different processes and it can be difficult to determine whether there is a named beneficiary. If you have been unable to find paperwork for the insurance policies that would show any named beneficiaries among her important papers then you could try having the most likely beneficiary or beneficiaries call. The Administrator can also be able to reach out to the insurance companies. If there is not a named beneficiary of the insurance policies and it turns out that the policies are owed to the Estate then the Administrator will need to collect those proceeds and administer them along with the rest of the Estate as described above: pay debts distributed remaining assets equally among heirs.Depending on the county you and your sons might find that the Clerk of Court can be of great assistance in sorting out some of these issues and at least getting you all on the right track to start administering the Estate. Clerks are not allowed to give legal advice but they should be able to help you think through who the heirs are an whether your sons have a right to file an Application for Letters.Good luck with this and please let me know if you have other questions."43872.8930555556 My ex sister in law has died and as far as anyone knows there is no will.

Since you mention the word executor I assume that there is a pending estate action going on, and would like confirmation from you as to whether that is the case; note that you cannot be an executor of a piece of property, but only over a decedent's estate.

Have you considered filing for a Chapter 50B Domestic Violence Protective Order (DVPO)?  An order may be granted for one of several reasons, including (###) whether your husband has actually or attempted to cause you bodily injury; (###) whether he has placed you in fear of imminent bodily harm (example: he has threatened you in a way that causes you to feel for your personal safety); and (###) whether he has placed you in fear of continued harassment that rises to such a level as to inflict substantial emotional distress.  Based on the information you provided, it sounds like you may have an argument under this third prong, especially since he continues to verbally abuse you during the visitation exchange process.  ### last for one year (they can be renewed for an additional two years) and if granted, it will prohibit your husband from contacting you either directly or indirectly (additional types of relief may be granted as well).  If an order is granted, you may ask the court to allow peaceful communication and contact relating solely to health and emergencies of your child, if any, and for custody visitation purposes.  If this contact is not peaceful (for example, if he continues to be verbally abusive during the exchange), or if he contacts you in any other way, then he would be in violation of the order, and he could face contempt charges as well as criminal prosecution. I advise reaching out to your local Legal Aid office for additional information on and assistance in obtaining a 50B protection order.

It is possible that under the facts you state above that you may be entitled to seek a modified child support order.  If the child support is otherwise modifiable, responsibility for another child would be included in the modification worksheet.  The issue about your decrease in income depends in part on whether any reduction in income was a result of a voluntary or involuntary act.  If there were errors in the original order you may be entitled to post order relief, but those are limited bases under certain time constraints from the original order.  You reference Family Code 4062, and I am assuming that is a ### citation.  If this is an NC order then NC law will govern.  If those travel expenses are new since entry of the original order, you may be able to include those as an extraordinary expense on the modified child support worksheet.  If those are not new and existed at time of the original child support order, then if the order is otherwise modifiable you may be able to include those as well.  Those expenses may also support a request to deviate" down from the worksheet calculation.

Although the exemption amount is zero, eligibility to claim an exemption may make you eligible for other tax benefits which I cannot elaborate upon.###) The custodial parent would need to sign this form, you could not file it on your own. The custodial parent (or the parent who has the child for the most nights out of the year) must waive their right to claim the exemption. That's what this form does. Then you as the noncustodial parent would file it with your taxes. So if the custodial parent is unwilling to do this then you would be ineligible anyway.Do you pay child support? If so then if you can convince the custodial parent to sign this form then you can file it with your taxes to see what benefits you may derive, but you need to show that you offer some level of support in order to claim the child. I hope this helps.Best,### 43928.6194444444 I was told by a friend he filed the form ###. He does not have physical custody.  He did mentioned he was on child support for that child.

The court determines whether and how much alimony to award depending on a number of factors, and the court has a lot of discretion in making this determination. Therefore, it is not possible to predict with any certainty what a court might decide. However, you can probably get a general idea of what the outcome might be by looking at the law and the particular facts of your situation.Before I give you my explanation and analysis of your situation, I have some questions that may help ### my answer. After youâ€™ve answered these, I will give you my summary of the factors that may come into play for determining alimony in your particular situation.Questions###.  What is the date of your separation?###.  When you went back to school, did you quit your job or take a leave of absence?  When did you do this relative to the date of separation? Before? After?###.  How long is this school program you are in?  What do you plan to do afterward?  Will you return to your old employer with a promotion?  Or, will you need to look for a new job?  Do you expect to earn a higher income (>$###) with your new degree or credentials?###.  Child support ($###,###00/month to â€œmy exâ€): Is this payment for the child (or children) of your current marriage, or are you talking about a child support payment for a child (or children) of a previous marriage?5.  Is the $###,###00/month child support pursuant to a courtâ€™s child support order? Or, are you paying that voluntarily on your own initiative?6.  Has your wife sought â€œpost-separation supportâ€ from the court â€“ meaning, temporary spousal support during the period of separation prior to divorce? I ask because, if you think she might ask for alimony (which is awarded at the time the divorce is final), I would expect that she already would have asked for temporary spousal support during this time before your divorce is final. Whether she has been awarded temporary post-separation support might predict whether and how much alimony she could be awarded at the time the divorce is final. If you have only been separated for a short period of time, she may not have sought temporary support yet.7.  The horses: You say all of them are â€œhersâ€ and one of them is yours. How many horses are there in total?  Did your wife own â€œherâ€ horses prior to your marriage, or were they acquired during your marriage?  The same question about â€œyourâ€ horse?  If any of these horses were acquired during the marriage, how were they acquired? (Gift? (and from whom?)  Inherited? Purchased with your joint funds? Adopted?)  I ask because the horses are potentially a significant property asset, and it's important to know whether they are joint marital property -- which may have some bearing on alimony issues.  Do you have an idea of what the market value is of these horses?  You also want to be mindful of the cost to maintain the horses, which could be another factor that comes into play when determining alimony (for example, what your wifeâ€™s â€œreasonable expensesâ€ might be). I know these are a lot of questions, but the answers will help me give you a better analysis.I look forward to hearing from you.Regards,Linda43873.9819444444 Married ### ###wife and I make the same just about (her ### me ### last year]i get VA as well which mean in total I make more (additional ### a year]we own a home together, a few vehicles, horses (all â€œhersâ€ except one for me), dogs, ###she wants a divorce, there has been no infidelity.i pay ###, I am a full time studentwill I have to pay alimony?thanks43873.1729166667 ###,First and foremost I would encourage you to speak with a family law attorney on this matter. Under North Carolina law you can only bring a paternity action prior to the child's 18th birthday. You note your daughter is already ###. N.C.G.S. 49-14.Were you married when she was born? Is there a man in her life who acts as her father for all intents and purposes other than being her biological father? Has she ever had any sort of relationship with this man prior to recent interactions?The reason I ask is that if she's ###, there's not much which can be done. Paternity usually needs to be established early in the child's life or by some action taken by the father. If he is refusing to do so, there's not much that can compel him to do so unless you do file for child support. Again, I would strongly encourage you to consult a family law attorney on this matter. I hope this small bit of information has been helpful to get you started.Best,Whitney 43928.6326388889 My daughter is ###. She still has a few months left until she graduates from high school.

There are cases where determining the date of separation is difficult and it may matter.  One key point:  Do not get divorced without asserting  a claim for post separation support/alimony or the entry of the divorce will forever cut off that right.  Same is true for equitable distribution (the division of marital property and debt), also cut off forever by entry of a divorce judgment if not pled as a claim before entry of the divorce.  Pleading claims for spousal support can be highly technical.  I am not aware of any court published forms to make claims or motions for spousal support.  You may want to call the North Carolina Bar Association Lawyer Referral Service to schedule a low-cost consultation with a North Carolina attorney.  The statutes governing spousal support are contained in Chapter ###.  I believe New ### County has a family court program as well, so there are likely local rules requirements about forms/financial affidavits you will need to file at certain times.

I was wondering how I would go about moving forward with my husband adopting her since we were both basically abandoned while I was pregnant. Her Dad that is actually in her life has the closest bond with her , even more than me and she deserves a good Dad in her life. What am I looking at moving forward with an adoption given the situation?43873.9 Thank you so much for the response. That's exactly what I was thinking needed to take place, but just wanted to be sure before. Is this something that I would need a lawyer for or could I move forward without one? 43921.8923611111 DSS cannot take custody without a court order, but they usually obtain one ex parte (without a hearing) at the time they file the petition without giving you notice to have a ###.If you have been served with the papers, you should have been appointed ### counsel to assist you.

After service of the complaint, every other paper is served by sending a copy regular mail, hand delivery, or fax.Can I request that his attorney not be allowed to represent him in that situation?  ... Probably not, but you should consult with a lawyer who could fully analyze the situation and provide individualized legal advice about the circumstance.  However, if he committed an unethical act, you can file a complaint with the North Carolina State Bar, you could also file a motion with the Court where your case is for the Judge to discipline the lawyer for unethical conduct. It sounds like for your post, you file filed a complaint for custody, the other side has obtain an extension of time to respond to the Complaint.  Before you can have a trial on the issue of custody, parties in North Carolina are required to attend custody mediation.  These most often happen at the same courthouse where you filed your paperwork. The custody mediation office can inform you how to schedule mediation. 43952.5791666667 If these other obligations for reimbursement are part of a court order and he is not complying with the court order, you have the right to pursue contempt proceedings.  You can file a motion for civil contempt, and the burden of proof will be on you to show that he has the ability to comply with the order but is willfully refusing to do so.  You could alternately file a motion for order to show cause, and have a judge enter a show cause order, and the burden of proof will be on him to show why he should not be held in contempt, and he would have to show a lack of ability to comply with the court ordered obligation.  His ability will be the key issue under either filing.  Chapter ### of the North Carolina General Statutes tells you more about the legal requirements for contempt.  There may also be local family court rules to follow in your county.43920.1590277778 My alimony is deducted automatically from his check.

Reason being: I had seen him in town, he states it was not him that I saw but his father, so I offered for me to contact his father to see if he would like to see my child and asked if he would like to visit my child as well. So, I am unsure if this is actually what he is wanting or if his mother is eager to have her could be  grandchild.

What would be the best legal thing, regarding the safety and well-being of our child, for us to do? What could the other potential father do if he does hire a lawyer? Also, if we did move could that make it harder for them to do anything or cause legal issues for us?43875.48125 Hello ###,First, I am sorry to hear that you and your wife are not doing well.In North Carolina, parents are primarily and jointly liable to provide support for their children. Their legal obligation is based on the party's relative ability to provided support (See N.C. ###. Stat. 50-######.###(a)). It is not necessary to have a custody order to get a child support order. Rather, they are treated as two separate issues. You do not have to establish custody prior to seeking a child support order from a judge (see N.C. ###. Stat. 50-######.###(b)).Many times, parents can reach an agreement about the amount of child support to pay. But, if they cannot reach an agreement, they can go to court and request for the court to enter an order for support. See N.C. ###. Stat. 50-######.###(c). The amount of child support that is awarded is based on the reasonable needs of the child, the income of the parents, the number of overnights the ### spends with each parent, and the expenses and responsibility for other children that each parent may have.If you do get a child support order, it will specify who must pay child support and how much that person must pay. Importantly, it does NOT establish rights to custody, who should have visitation, who should pay spousal support, or who pays debts.If at any time you reconcile with your wife and you do not believe that child support is necessary, you can ask the child support enforcement office to suspend the order. If at any time while your wife is obligated to make payments her payments get in arrears, you do have the option of forgiving the arrearage. you would just need to contact the child support office and file a written statement saying that you do not want arrears.You can get help from the local Child Support Enforcement office if you do not get public assistance. All you have to do is complete the application and pay the required fee. The application is available here: https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/social-services/child-support-enforcement.If separation and divorce is something you would like to pursue, the first step is to establish a separate residence.  In North Carolina, you can have a no fault divorce. What this means is that you do not have to prove that your spouse caused your marriage to fail. The most common ground for absolute divorce in North Carolina is separation for a period of one year per N.C. ###. Stat. ###. To obtain a divorce on these grounds you must prove:(###) that either you or your spouse has lived in NC for at least ###;(###) that you and your husband were validly married to begin with;(###) that you have been separated for at least one year before you file for divorce (you must be living in separate residences . . . living in separate rooms or separate parts of the house does NOT count);(###) that at least one of the spouses has no intent to resume the marriage;(5) you must include an affidavit of military status under the Service Member Civil Relief Act; and(6) if you want to change your name in the divorce, you'll have to request to do so in your Complaint that you will file one year after you have been separated.Once these requirements are satisfied, you can proceed with a divorce. Here is a packet about how to proceed with that: https://www.nccourts.gov/assets/inline-files/NC-Divorce-Packet-V###-###-Sept-###0###9_0.pdf?qb0PNAk8pbOaZm8###0.lTZ0fx8pdpKXSe.If you decide to separate with your wife, it is probably best to attempt to work out some sort of separation agreement with her related to important decisions about your children (like child support), your finances, and your personal property. Importantly, separation agreements are contracts. They are valid only if signed by both parties and notarized. It is also a good idea to contain a clause within the agreement about who will pay attorney fees if an action is later brought by either party related to a breach of this agreement.If possible, it would be beneficial to retain counsel to help you negotiate this agreement.I believe I have addressed your concerns.Thanks,###43921.8659722222 I am trying to find out how I should go about filing for child support payments to my wife while still legally married. I am considering separation but have not moved on this idea as of yet. We have been having differences for some time now and I would like to know how I can pay child support while still married. What is the best course of action for me to take?43875.6319444444 Dear Mr. ###,As a general matter, you should have parental rights of custody and/or visitation of your child.  The question is, which state has jurisdiction over making custody and visitation decisions.  Since the child was not born in North Carolina or has not resided here, no court in North Carolina has jurisdiction over the matter.Since the child was born in the Dominican Republic, the DR has original jurisdiction over custody matters of the child and retains that jurisdiction unless and until the child has resided in New York for at least six months with its mother.  If the child has already resided in NY for six months or more, the State of New York now has sole jurisdiction over custody and visitation matters.  In that case, you would have to file an action for custody or visitation in the county in New York where the child is residing.You may wish to consult with an attorney who is licensed in New York to advise you on your options.Best of luck.Regards,Linda43879.7701388889 Mr. ###,I wanted to add -- if you didn't know, already -- that your child is both a US citizen (through you) and a DR citizen (through her mother).  Her US citizenship is not affected by the fact that she was born in the DR, has a mother who is a DR citizen or has a DR birth certificate.  If a child has a parent who is a US citizen, that child is a US citizen at birth--period.So, although the mother of your child is in the US legally on a visa, your child is here legally as a US citizen.  She didn't need a visa to come here.In any event, your child's citizenship does not affect custody, which is based on residence, not citizenship. Something to keep in mind, however, is that if the mother somehow loses her right to be in the US and has to go back to the DR, she would have the right to take the child with her, unless you already have some type of custody order in place that prohibits her from taking the child out of the country without your permission.  It looks to me like the mother is planning and hoping to stay in the US, so that may not be a concern for you.  But it's something to keep in mind, since you never know how a situation can change for a person who is in the US on a conditional basis.  Unless and until the mother acquires US citizenship, there will always be the possibility that she loses her right to stay in the US.  Note, also, that the mother could choose to move back to the DR at some point.  As I understand it, the DR allows a person to acquire another citizenship without giving up their DR citizenship.  So, the mother will always have the choice to move back to the DR without any restrictions, as long as she retains her DR citizenship.The same is true for any decision the mother makes to move to another country.  If she has de facto" custody of your child and there is no custody order that prevents her from taking the child out of the country without your permission she has the right to do that.I hope this has been helpful.RegardsLinda"43879.8041666667 Mr. ###,One final thought: Once you raise the issue of custody and visitation, it is also likely that the mother will raise the issue of child support and request that it be included in any custody/visitation order.  I do not know if she could request retroactive support, or if she could request support going back as far as the birth of the child while they were living in the DR.  That would be a question for a New York attorney.If you have been paying some type of support already, even if voluntarily and informally (as opposed to under a court order), you may want to collect information on what you have paid, in case a claim for past child support is made.Linda43879.8118055556 You're very welcome.Good luck with everything.Linda43879.8326388889 my child was born in Dominican republic but now resides with her mother in the Bronx.she came here with on a family visa through he mother's father and she still has a Dominican birth certificate that I signed.my question is what is my parental rights if any.visitation or custody rightsI am a u.s. citizen43875.6993055556 thanksvery heplful43879.8305555556 Before you file an Entry of Default" it is customary that you have evidence that you have exhausted your efforts to get the other side to respond.  You should send a letter to the opposing counsel letting them know that their response is late and asking when they intend to file their response. Keep a copy of the letter for your file.  Good luck."43948.8763888889 My previous attorney filed petition for full custody on my behalf and since has withdrawn from the case . The opposing attorney first filed extension which was due ###19 , she still to this date hasn't filed answer to the petition. What do I do next as a pro se litigate?43876.7840277778 I originally filed for an uncontested divorce in ### ###. I was representing myself in court using the legal service LawAssure for the papers since my spouse and I have no children or property to split. Since the last extension in January of ###, both myself and my ex have moved locations (he was located in Iredell County when I originally filed). I called Catawba County Courthouse today to ask if I can transfer the divorce to my current residential county of ### where it will be easier for me to proceed with the divorce, but was told I would need to ask an attorney. Due to a number of complications with my ex, the divorce summons still need to be served to him. We have not resided together or resumed marital contact since ###. I do not know where he currently lives, although I can obtain that information.I was told over the phone that I can keep the divorce in Catawba County when I called the courthouse, but that would make it difficult for me to proceed. So my question is, can I transfer the divorce from Catawba or should I refile in ### County? If I can transfer the divorce, how do I go about starting that process? Is it possible to list my address on the divorce forms as a USPS PO box (due to personal safety concerns over providing my ex my physical address)?Thank you!43879.6395833333 If the complaint you file only seeks an absolute divorce and you want to transfer your case to another county you have two options (###) you can file a motion to transfer venue - generally for that to be granted neither you living in the county where the action is currently pending and the request must be to transfer to a county where you or your spouse reside (and the motion would need to be noticed and calendar by you to then be heard by the court) or (###) you could voluntarily dismiss the action without prejudice and refile the action in the new county (the state has a form for that - https://www.nccourts.gov/documents/forms/notice-of-voluntary-dismissal).  Please know if you dismiss your case, you be starting over - you would have to serve him again and pay new filing fees. If no one resides in Catawba County, a motion to transfer venue to another NC county has a high likelihood of success. Generally, in a motion to transfer venue, you identify which county you live in, that no one resides in the county where the case is pending, and ask that the case be transferred to the county where you reside.  You would file the written motion with the clerk, mail a copy to the Defendant, and keep a copy for your records.  Then you would also need to file a certificate of service, indicating that you mailed a copy to the Defendant (and it would need to state the address where you mailed it).  Then you would need to notice it for hearing and calendar it.  If you do not know how to do that, you should consult with an attorney. Yes, you can use a PO Box as your mailing address.  43952.5902777778 My ex has moved out of state to ###, I am not sure how that affects things moving forward. 43879.6569444444 I would like to make sure my son gets my house and property as soon as possible at my death. He is not married and lives with me. I am married but my husband is not my son's father.  I have ###. The house is only in my name at this time because I bought it before I was married. The house belonged to my Mother before me and I want it to stay in the family. What is the best way to do this?  Thank you so much43879.6472222222 Thank you so much for taking the time and answering my question, ### Woods43880.6611111111 Typically the best way to transfer any type of property, land or otherwise, after your death is through a will. If you do not have a will, the laws of intestacy will apply.No Will/IntestacyIf you die without a will and your husband and three children all survive you, your husband would inherit ###/### ###/###, so a ###/###. If you have more children or any predecease you then that fraction will change. If you die without a will, your husband dies before you, and all three children survive you, they will each inherit ###/###. Get a WillYou can execute a will that conveys the house to your son alone and also disposes of the rest of your estate as you may desire. An attorney would be in the best position to draft a will for you and advise you regarding this transaction considering some of the implications I will point out below. The State Employees' Credit Union offers a very affordable estate planning service, $###, $###. If you are a member of SECU, you might check in with your local branch about this service. Even if you decide not to engage an attorney to draft the will, an SECU Specialist or Estate Planning representative would talk to you for free. The SECU employee can't provide legal advice but would be able to provide helpful information and talk to you about your testamentary plans. If you or your spouse are fire ###, police, or other first responders, you might also be eligible for free will drafting if there is a Wills for Heroes event that is convenient for you.Problems with Giving House to SonThere are some issues with this plan that you should consider. First, you might not want to create a situation where your son can evict your husband as soon as you pass. Second, as your spouse, your husband also has a marital interest in your house and the rest of your estate. In NC, your surviving spouse is entitled to a certain amount of your estate so it is impossible to completely disinherit them if they choose to exercise their right to a share of your estate. Depending on what other assets you have, your husband may be able to claim an interest in your house in order to satisfy that claim.Regardless of whether you die with a will or without a will, the ownership of that land will transfer to the heir/beneficiary immediately upon death, although practically it often takes some time to update the tax administration, land record if necessary, and probate a will if you have one. Good luck with this. I strongly encourage you to consult an attorney who can review your overall situation in order to make sure your wishes are carried out upon your death.43880.6395833333 ###,You will need to file a motion contesting the foreign custody order.  A model form is attached.Also, you are going to need to mail the form or work with a local attorney as North Carolina state courts only accept paper filings, not electronic filings.Best of luck.43920.9381944444 Mother and I have a current child custody/visitation/ child support order in Orange, California.  ###,###'s request to move to North Carolina. Judge did order the jurisdiction of the case to stay in California. Since then, mother has refused visits, phone calls, and has made every situation very problematic.  I have lost money on plane tickets; every time a visit is scheduled there is constant arguments on the talking parents app that we are ordered to communicate through; the phone calls mother is influencing our daughter to not talk to me.

I am on very low income, what process would I need to do and is this something I would/could file myself?  If this is not something I can do, is there low income lawyers that possibly would take payment arrangements?  Are you able to advise me with the forms numbers I would need?  Is there any penalty or negative impact for not filing and wait for the court date we have set in California? I received the paperwork for the request for registration of foreign custody order on ###,###.The paperwork mother filed was in Wake county courthouse.Thank you for your time43879.8 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question; I was browsing on NC Free Legal Answers and I noticed that this question from last month had not yet been answered.  Since no other lawyer has responded, I will therefore do so now.The written terms of the separation agreement remain enforceable and valid, and this can be sued upon if either party breaches; however, the verbal promise with respect to early sales of real property and corresponding payoff amounts, is not enforceable.  In fact, you were fortunate that he tried to make good on the verbal promise at all, since he was not legally required to do so based on the verbal assurance (even if he may have had a moral duty to do so).  So insofar as you would consider suing him for breach, it would have to be based on what actually made it into the written iteration of your agreement.This is obviously unfortunate given that you had no choice to sell off the home due to circumstances largely beyond your direct control, but legally, the verbal promises are not enforceable.  I wish I had better news to report on that.I hope you and your family will make it safely through the Covid-###, and that whatever burdens you might have borne due to the early sale of the home can be shouldered without undue effect upon your quality of life.  God bless you and all those you love during this challenging time.  Be well.43918.9534722222 My separation agreement was written by my ex husband and signed and notarized by us ( without legal representation,) and incorporated into the divorce decree. He agreed to pay the house payment on my house until it was paid completely and then it would be deeded to me. He had also verbally agreed afterwards that if I ever sold the house before it was paid off he would pay me the loan payoff amount, so I would get the full value of the house. (He wouldnâ€™t put that in writing or notarize it.)After the divorce he made payments for ###â€™t afford to make the payment, so I had to sell the house to keep from being foreclosed. He made payments towards the loan payoff balance ($###) to me for ###, said he would start up again when he could. Itâ€™s been two years without a payment and now he refuses to pay and says I can just sue him. My question is, do I have any legal recourse? Thanks 43879.8208333333 Thank you so much for responding to my question, your answer is what I expected. At least now I can try to put this behind me. Take care and may God bless you as well.43919.0631944444 Thank you so much, and be of good cheer and courage.  You will rebound from this and any other complicating difficulties.  All the best.43919.1569444444 Hello ###,I am very sorry to hear that you are going through this. Hopefully, I can help you understand your situation a bit more so that you can make an informed decision about whether these are issues that you are comfortable and capable of tackling on your own or whether you would feel more comfortable seeking additional legal help.I understand that you are going through a separation. If you and your spouse are living apart from each other and have no intentions to resume the marriage (which it does not sound like you do based on his drug problem etc.) then you are considered separated. I am assuming that your main objective is to divorce your husband.In North Carolina, you can have a no fault divorce. What this means is that you do not have to prove that your spouse caused your marriage to fail. The most common ground for absolute divorce in North Carolina is separation for a period of one year per N.C. ###. Stat. ###. To obtain a divorce on these grounds you must prove:(###) that either you or your spouse has lived in NC for at least ###;(###) that you and your husband were validly married to begin with;(###) that you have been separated for at least one year before you file for divorce (you must be living in separate residences . . . living in separate rooms or separate parts of the house does NOT count);(###) that at least one of the spouses has no intent to resume the marriage;(5) you must include an affidavit of military status under the Service Member Civil Relief Act; and(6) if you want to change your name in the divorce, you'll have to request to do so in your Complaint that you will file one year after you have been separated. I don't know how long that you have been separated, but after you have been separated for a year you can proceed with the divorce. Here is a packet about how to proceed with that https://www.nccourts.gov/assets/inline-files/NC-Divorce-Packet-V###-###-Sept-###0###9_0.pdf?qb0PNAk8pbOaZm8###0.lTZ0fx8pdpKXSe.I understand that you are concerned about your financial situation, especially considering that he was the main income producer and you were the one who stayed at home with the kids. In North Carolina, when you are a dependent spouse you may qualify for alimony. Alimony is a payment for the support and maintenance of the dependent spouse either by a lump sum or on a continuing basis (think monthly payments). For more information about the ###, you can refer to N.C. ###. Stat. 50-###6.###A.Alimony can be settled out of court in the form of a separation agreement where your spouse would agree to pay you a certain amount of money to support you. If you don't think he'd agree to that, then you would have to proceed with an action to collect alimony. It is important to note that one major effect of divorce is that it ends your right to claim alimony and equitable distribution unless that is pending prior to the entry of the judgment of divorce (See N.C. ###. Stat. 50-######). I also understand that you have already signed some sort of mutual separation agreement. Separation agreements are contracts between you and your spouse about certain important decisions. While not necessary in order to be separated, ###erally these types of agreements can work to minimize conflict between separating spouses so that both parties can move on. ###erally, it is preferred that each side has independent counsel review the agreement prior to signing to see if additional negotiations may prove necessary prior to signing the document. Hopefully, your agreement outlined subjects such as who would pay each debt, especially as he was the primary income producer. Separation agreements can also make requests for distribution of property, spousal support and custody. It may be worth trying to negotiate a new separation agreement to address your concerns about spousal support and custody, depending on how difficult your current husband is being.Based on what you posted, it sounds like your primary concern is about the custody of your children because you believe he will do what he can do avoid child support. In North Carolina, parents are primarily and jointly liable to provide support for their children. Their legal obligation is based on the party's relative ability to provided support (See N.C. ###. Stat. 50-######.###(a)). It is not necessary to have a custody order to get a child support order. Rather, they are treated as two separate issues. You do not have to establish custody prior to seeking a child support order from a judge (see N.C. ###. Stat. 50-######.###(b)).In fact, the Child Support Enforcement program administered by NC Health and Human Services helps people get child support even when there is no divorce or custody order (see N.C. ###. Stat. 50-######.###(h)). You can get help from the local Child Support Enforcement office if you do not get public assistance. You will have to complete an application and pay the required fee to do this. The application is found here: https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/social-services/child-support-enforcement.If there is no court order determining who has custody of the children, each parent has an equal right to live with the child. If you all cannot work out amongst yourselves how the children will split their time between you and your current husband, then it will become necessary to bring a formal custody action in court. In North Carolina, to settle custody for your children (so long as the child has lived in NC for ###, the child must have lived in NC for at least six months prior to you bringing the custody action. Custody will be awarded based on something called the best interest" standard. In other words what arrangements will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. Your husbands drug problem will be considered when making that determination.Let me know if this addresses all the concerns you have raised.Thanks###"43921.8270833333 Hello,        Iâ€™m currently going through Separation with a mutual separation agreement. No court orders ect. I was a dependent homemaker for ###. My spouse was recently kicked out of the Army for drug use. His mental state changed to not wanting or trying to be in our marriage. Especially, when he got a gf. Who is in psychology and greatly impacts him. In return impacting my children. I feel a little helpless because he has the material aspects to take take care of my children but I strongly feel his mental state and decisions are making him currently unfit. Heâ€™s ### things and manipulates. Iâ€™m now catching on but I hope Iâ€™m not too late. My children have incorrect views about me. Itâ€™s overall a very intentional and malicious relationship with my spouse. How can I prove these things in court? Will it even matter? Iâ€™m terrified because at the present moment heâ€™s much better off financially. I just feel defeated sometimes when I know that I think about our children and he often does not. What if anything can I do???? Iâ€™m worried that heâ€™s trying to get full custody of my children! Probably to avoid child support. 43879.9486111111 Hello,My name is ### and I am writing on behalf of my boyfriend, ###.### is struggling with a custody issue. His son's mother is making it incredibly hard to see his son. They were never married and no court has ordered any PR&R, thus it is currently shared. He sends her child support every month, ### weekly, and sends birthday and holiday gifts, etc but she still calls him a deadbeat. She lives in Ashville, NC and we are in Maine and she says if he wants to see his son that he should come there. (Which he has, but would really like for his son to visit his home and he would like to see him more) He would love summers and every other holiday/birthday with him, but she will not even let him come here for a week without sending her pictures of our home. We realize at this point we will need legal help, but don't know where to start and we have very limited income. I am recently disabled and he is self-employed. His money goes towards bills and child support and we pretty much have nothing left over after that. This whole situation is incredibly frustrating because he is a good father, loves his son, and just wants to see him. His ex treats him as though because he left her, that he relinquished his rights as a father, but that is simply not true. Right?I did some research and realize that any court proceedings will have to take place there in NC as that is the child's primary residence, and guessing we need a lawyer from there as well. Do we definitely need a lawyer?  I saw that mediation is usually the first process, so I'm wondering the best way to go about that, as we are here in Maine. Is it possible to do initial mediation meetings via phone or Skype? What should be our next steps?Thank you in advance for your help, ###43880.55 If you allow your parents to have custody of your child there are a number of ramifications for doing that.  I believe they will have to have custody in order to get insurance on the child.  If you give them custody then you will have to prove a substantial change in circumstances in order to get the child back in your custody.  If you give them temporary custody and the Order stays in place for a year or more it becomes a permanent custody order and you have the same issue of having to prove a substantial change in circumstances to get your child back in your custody.  There are many dangers.  If you trust your parents and insurance is important you could consider it but I would normally not recommend giving custody to anyone other than a parent.  43952.70625 My son currently lives with my parents because I have moved around a lot for my job and thought that was more stable. My parents offered to help. My sons mom and I have custody over him with my sons mom as primary. My sons mom live in a different state than my son as do I. My parents are requesting permanent custody over my son stating that they want to add him to their insurance policy and I am wondering if that is necessary or is there any way I could give them temporary custody over him so that they could do so. Giving them permanent custody seems so extreme and I worry about giving up all my right then losing my say in what happens to my son.43880.5638888889 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and I hope your family is managing well under the current coronavirus pandemic.  I noticed that your question has not yet been answered from last month, so I wanted to offer some preliminary feedback.Based on the relative situation between you and your husband, and the biological parents, I seriously doubt that a court would grant custody to the latter two, although there may need to be an adjustment should you and your husband separate or get divorced.  In general, there must be a material change in circumstances" in order for a custody order to be modified; this means that there has not only been a change but a change so ### that it clearly impacts the child's welfare and well being.  If the child's situation day-to-day will not materially change there is a strong possibility that the prior custody order will remain in effect.  I suggest then that you and your husband discuss this together in terms of what would best help the child then proceed from there.  It may be that you hire a lawyer just to represent you two at the custody hearing if a family law attorney concludes that a Motion to Modify Custody Order is appropriate based on the changes in your marital situation.  A family law attorney who regularly practices law in the county where the prior order was entered would likely have the best insight into how this would actually work since an experienced attorney in the local area will have a strong sense of how the local District Court judges are likely to rule on such a request should such a request have to be made upon the court.But in terms of the parents getting custody back--that is a great unlikelihood if they are similar to how they have been up until February when you first posted this question.  This will be more a question of how your divorce affects where the child stays day to day than whether the parents are now worthy of having their custody rights restored.Blessings to you and your family as you work through this issue and the current pandemic.  Be healthy well productive and of good cheer."43915.0131944444 In ### ### (child not biologically related to my husband) there was opioid abuse on the part of both mom and dad.February of ### (my daughter) passed away from Leukemia.After going to court against the baby's father we were awarded sole physical and legal custody in ###### (father has many legal and opioid addiction issues) father only has  supervised visits at a center twice a month. Would her custody be in jeopardy if my husband and I separated/divorced?43880.6743055556 First, you need to file a complaint for custody. You can get a packet for a pro se" custody packet from either your local courthouse or from Legal Aid of North Carolina. Here is a link to the Legal Aid custody information: https://www.lawhelpnc.org/resource/file-it-yourself-custody-packetAfter you follow all of the instructions on filing for custody follow your local court rules for setting up a mediation session. The mediation is free. If it is unsafe for you to mediate with the father you can also ask for a waiver of mediation. Your local courthouse clerk or mediation office should have a form for you to complete to request that mediation be waived. Otherwise you can get the form at the Administrative Office of Courts website- ### form: AOC-CV-632If you don't come to an agreement in mediation or mediation is waived then you will get a court date set by the mediation office.

His father is on drugs and communicating threats. He has been in my custody for over a year now since his father and i split up. I want to be able to have it where he cannot just go and get him whereever he may be. I just dont want my son in a predictment of being stopped with his dad nd there be stuff in his car or anything like that. What do i need to do next?Thank you### ###43880.8527777778 Good afternoon, Ms. Rachalla:Thank you for your question.  While there will be considerable advantages for your children's father due to his being represented when you are not, it is also true that this fact will not mean that the process will completely steamroll you.  District Court judges tend to be highly sensitive to the ### of the families appearing in front of them, and a judge will be thinking in his/her mind, first and foremost, What is in the best interest of these children?"  The judge will almost certainly not take the children completely from you because every judge knows that separating children entirely or even mostly from their mother during such a tender age as your boys will cause permanent damage to them even when they are adults.  The only reason a judge would consider giving sole custody to the father is if you consented to doing so or there was some compelling proof that you are an unfit parent due to evidence of your neglect abuse or physical emotional or sexual ###.  Judges are very conservative when it comes to depriving biological mothers of their children and will do so only when the evidence truly necessitates it.  I seriously doubt that any District Court judge in family law court will deem you an "unfit" parent.The most likely outcome is that you will get 50-### or that you will get most of the custody so that the children can attend school on a consistent basis.  Weekends holidays summers and the like is where you will likely have your most detailed negotiations.  The lawyer will of course try to press his client's every advantage but the judge will let hardball tactics go only so far if you appear to be just as credible morally fit and worthy a parent as he does.  I think that for most District Court judges--especially the female ones many of whom are mothers themselves--your being the mother will be an advantage no matter how much the father's lawyer tries to argue otherwise.  This is especially true given how young your sons are.Be prepared to discuss how your fiance being in this picture will not hurt the boys in any way.  There will be some curiosity on the judge's part about your fiance's occupation background personality characteristics etc. and do not be surprised if the opposing lawyer has done a background check into your fiance in order to see if blemishes exist in his past.  I think you will make it okay given the circumstances but just be prepared to argue why your new home environment with your fiance is conducive to a healthy childhood for your boys.  Also be prepared to be generous with your children's father when it comes to times away from school; that might be an enticement to the other side to work with you a little more.I hope and pray the very best for your sons who of course are the most important people in this dispute.  Let's hope you get a fair compassionate and caring judge who will keep that fact uppermost in mind.Be safe and warm amid the ### snows today and tomorrow.  God bless you and your family and my best wishes to you in your imminent ###."43881.9208333333 I have ###. ###â€™m having to fight for custody for against their father. I filed for custody last ###. He counterclaimed  for full custody and retained an attorney. I havenâ€™t been able to afford the retainer fee most attorneys are asking. Our boys are ### ###. Iâ€™m a stay at home mom and my now ### works. Now prior to all of this and our oldest starting school we did week on week off but weâ€™re never actually able to discuss school and how we would do it before he tried keeping them from me. My ### and I are more than capable of taking care for all of our children and they donâ€™t need or want for anything (theyâ€™re spoiled). However their dad does own a small welding business that does fairly well. My biggest things are Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to lose my ###â€™t afcord the retainer.. and also that if he is rewarded custody or 50/###â€™ve had, ### have to switch schools and constantly be ### around between school baby ### the girlfriend the ### and whoever else at all different times because heâ€™s on call most days and works late crazy hours. I have no intentions of keeping them from him I just want whatâ€™s best for them mentally as well physically. Iâ€™d like joint custody with me being the primary caregiver. Iâ€™d like for them to continue living with me and he have them when itâ€™s more convenient to his work schedule and on a set basis of every other weekend.. I guess what Iâ€™m asking is if this is even possible with me not being able to afford an attorney? 43881.7333333333 In short, any testimony under oath or other evidence (photos, texts, emails, other communications, etc.) that is relevant is fair game.  Remember that the ### for this type of proceeding is, What is in the best interests of the children?"  Anything that the judge deems relevant will be heard and examined--with some evidence bearing more weight than others.  That is about the only way I can answer that question.  "43882.1159722222 No problem.  Hoping for a fair and just outcome for the boys.43882.1215277778 Thank you so much for answering my question! Youâ€™ve definitely put me more at ease from the panic feeling Iâ€™ve been having the last few weeks. I have a few more questions if you donâ€™t mind answering those as well I would greatly appreciate it. I have no no intentions to go in to court and make their father out to be a horrible person because he is a great father to them regardless of the problems weâ€™ve ###r had with each other. How###r in his counter claim heâ€™s tried his best to make me seem like a terrible mother.. if push came to shove and his lawyer was definitely trying to make me seem unfit would it benefit to being up the physical abuse towards me or any of the dangerous situations heâ€™s caused with our ###? For instance.. last Christmas I agreed to let him have them Christmas morning (2018). Christmas ### I picked them up for dinner with my family, taking them back I had my fiancÃ© with me and their dad went crazy. Yelling and screaming in my face and poking me in the forehead. When my fiancÃ© told him to calm down and that it wasnâ€™t okay to scream at me like that my kids dad ran and got his gun and came back pointing it at my fiance.. with my daughter in the car and our two boys standing right there. My fiancÃ© stayed in the car and n###r once got out. After i and my exes mother and her bf dragged him away from our car he slammed me into the tree and proceeded to go back to our car waving his pistol around threatening to shoot him in the head.. by then the boys grandma had already taken them in the house and asked ###ryone to leave. I did t want to cause more of a scene and scare my kids ###n more so we left. There was a lot of physical and mental abuse in our relationship throughout the whole time (which is why I ###ntually left).. I donâ€™t want to have to bring those things up but if it became necessary would I ###n have the chance to do so with not having an attorney? 43882.10625 Thank you so much! Have a great night and thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. I really appreciate it. 43882.1201388889 My fiancÃ© has been trying to see his daughter and make agreements with the mother of his child but she will not allow it at all. His daughter is ###. I personally myself have try to reach out and she turned me down completely at this point there nothing we can do but itâ€™s unfair that my fiancÃ© canâ€™t have any kind of relationship or get to know his daughter just cause the mother wonâ€™t allow it. 43881.8305555556 Your fiancÃ© can file for custody, and request visitation as well as legal custody for his daughter.  A court would then decide how much time he and his daughter get to spend together, and it would not be dependent on what mom says but what the court orders.  Before he files, it would be beneficial if he is not behind on child support payments.  Finally, visitation is based on what is in the child's best interest, so if he has done something in the past that harmed the child, that would be considered by the court.  He can get more detailed advice by calling the Lawyer Referral Service at ###.  He can speak to an attorney for ### $###.  Good luck to you both!43952.7048611111 Hello ###,First, I am incredibly sorry to hear that you are experiencing these issues. A major life change like this - especially after ### - is very tough. It sounds like you have three main concerns (###) how to legally divorce your husband; (###) how to obtain spousal support and/or alimony given that your spouse was the primary income producer throughout your marriage; and (###) how to receive your share of the marital assets.To address your first concern, in North Carolina, you can have a no fault divorce. What this means is that you do not have to prove that your spouse caused your marriage to fail. The most common ground for absolute divorce in North Carolina is separation for a period of one year per N.C. ###. Stat. ###. To obtain a divorce on these grounds you must prove:(###) that either you or your spouse has lived in NC for at least ###;(###) that you and your husband were validly married to begin with;(###) that you have been separated for at least one year before you file for divorce (you must be living in separate residences . . . living in separate rooms or separate parts of the house does NOT count);(###) that at least one of the spouses has no intent to resume the marriage;(5) you must include an affidavit of military status under the Service Member Civil Relief Act; and(6) if you want to change your name in the divorce, you'll have to request to do so in your Complaint that you will file one year after you have been separated.I don't know how long that you have been separated, but after you have been separated for a year you can proceed with the divorce. Here is a packet about how to proceed with that https://www.nccourts.gov/assets/inline-files/NC-Divorce-Packet-V###-###-Sept-###0###9_0.pdf?qb0PNAk8pbOaZm8###0.lTZ0fx8pdpKXSe.To address your second concern, I understand that you are worried about your financial situation, especially considering that he was the main income producer. In North Carolina, when you are a dependent spouse you may qualify for alimony. Alimony is a payment for the support and maintenance of the dependent spouse either by a lump sum or on a continuing basis (think monthly payments). For more information about the ###, you can refer to N.C. ###. Stat. 50-###6.###A. I have copied and pasted the ###:(###) The marital misconduct of either of the spouses. Nothing herein shall prevent a court from considering incidents of post ### marital misconduct as corroborating evidence supporting other evidence that marital misconduct occurred during the marriage and prior to date of separation;(###) The relative earnings and earning capacities of the spouses;(###) The ages and the physical, mental, and emotional conditions of the spouses;(###) The amount and sources of earned and unearned income of both spouses, including, but not limited to, earnings, dividends, and benefits such as medical, retirement, insurance, social security, or others;(5) The duration of the marriage;(6) The contribution by one spouse to the education, training, or increased earning power of the other spouse;(7) The extent to which the earning power, expenses, or financial obligations of a spouse will be affected by reason of serving as the custodian of a minor child;(8) The standard of living of the spouses established during the marriage;(9) The relative education of the spouses and the time necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the spouse seeking alimony to find employment to meet his or her reasonable economic needs;(###0) The relative assets and liabilities of the spouses and the relative debt service requirements of the spouses, including legal obligations of support;(######) The property brought to the marriage by either spouse;(######) The contribution of a spouse as homemaker;(######) The relative needs of the spouses;(######) The federal, State, and local tax ramifications of the alimony award;(###5) Any other factor relating to the economic circumstances of the parties that the court finds to be just and proper.(###6) The fact that income received by either party was previously considered by the court in determining the value of a marital or divisible asset in an equitable distribution of the parties' marital or divisible property.Alimony can be settled out of court in the form of a separation agreement where your spouse would agree to pay you a certain amount of money to support you. If you don't think he'd agree to that (especially considering that he has changed the locks, won't let you in the home, and maintains his position that somehow all the property is his), then you would have to proceed with an action to collect alimony. It is important to note that one major effect of divorce is that it ends your right to claim alimony and equitable distribution unless that is pending prior to the entry of the judgment of divorce (See N.C. ###. Stat. 50-######). Now I am going to address your third concern about how to get your share of the marital property. North Carolina is not a community property state. Therefore, judges will divide property in accordance with the equitable division method. Equitable division does not mean that the assets will be divided equally. Rather, it means that the assets will be fairly divided. Before the court can divide your property, it must characterize the asset in question as either marital property, divisible property, or separate property. Any property determined to be separate property" will not be divided.Marital property is all property acquired or earned during the marriage up until the date of separation. Pensions retirement benefits and other deferred compensation rights earned during the marriage are also marital property. The court will presume that all property acquired during the marriage and before separation is marital property. See N.C. ###. Stat. 50-###0(b)(###).Then the court uses the divisible property category to catch any change in value of the marital property that happens between the day you got separated and the distribution day. This includes any money or property that both spouses earned during the marriage but did not realize until after separation (think a bonus or a commission check). It could also be an interest payment or dividend issued from a marital bank or stock account.Property that will not be divided is separate property. Separate property is property that you actively gain or lose after separation or any property that you owned prior to marriage. It can also include property that you received during marriage but only if that property was intended for you alone - such as a gift an inheritance or a professional license - or acquired by exchange of your separate property. When the judge is determining how to divide your property the court will consider factors such as: (###) each spouse's age and health; (###) each spouse's income assets and liabilities; (###) the length of the marriage; (###) the ### of the marital property; and (5) how each spouse contributed to the marital property or dissipated marital assets.I believe this sufficiently addresses your concerns ###.Let me know if you have any follow-up questions###"43930.8402777778 My husband of ###.

This is despite Coronavirus affecting courts.  You have a right to counsel if you are considered indigent.  You will fill out an affidavit about your income and expenses to determine whether or not you are indigent (poor) and cannot afford counsel so that one will be appointed for you.

I take it, you were not married?  This was a non-marital relationship that broke up?###.  Was any of the property purchased jointly?  Or did your ex pay for all of it?  Did you help to pay for any of those things?  I'm asking to determine if any of the things might be considered joint property, in which case, you'd have equal rights in how to dispose of it.###.  How much stuff is there?  Are there any high-value items, like a TV or anything else?  What would you say is the estimated total value of the items?  I'm just looking for a general estimate -- nothing exact.  For items in almost new condition, use 50% of what you think the original purchase price might have been.  For items in clearly used condition, use ###5% or less (down to zero value).  One way to think about this is, what could you get if you sold it at a yard sale?  If the items are generally low value, I would not be concerned about disposing them.  If you have something of really high value, like a television set or other electronics, then it gives you an idea of how likely your ex is going to seek some type of legal action if you dispose of them without his consent.  It doesn't mean he would prevail -- this is just to get an idea of how likely he is to seek some time of legal relief.My initial thoughts:I would consider these items legally abandoned in which case, you should be able to dispose of them any way that you like.  It has been three or four years, which is far longer than any landlord would have to keep the items.You have given him multiple opportunities to collect his things.  He knows where they are but has shown no interest in taking them.  You're not a free storage unit for your ex.  (He's not paying you to store them, right?)Normally, it would have been best to have given a written notice with your own deadline (###, ###), but I understand how you didn't think it was necessary at the time.  Now that you have no way to contact him, and it's been more than three years, I would say it is not your responsibility to try to track him down. If you choose to send a letter:BY LETTER, POSTAL SERVICE:If you think there is a way to identify an address for him, then you can send a letter, if you wish.  If you do: (###) keep a copy of the letter; (###) send it by certified mail or some way that guarantees it was delivered (and keep a copy of the post office/UPS receipt that shows the date the letter was sent).BY E-MAIL:If you have only an e-mail address, you can send the notice by e-mail.  If you have a way to request a read receipt, that would be ideal.  If not, then just keep a copy of the e-mail you sent.  Make a note somewhere about why you thought this was a correct e-mail address for him.  If he responds to your e-mail, that serves as your read receipt and you should definitely keep all copies of e-mails sent and received.BY TEXT MESSAGE:I don't recommend text messages because it's difficult to write a lot of detail and to avoid typos, and they're not easy to save in a user-friendly format.  But, if there are any communications between you two by text message on this subject, take a screen shot and save all of them.CONTENTS OF THE LETTER/NOTICE:###.  The ### he left the items at your property;###.  A list of items left behind (it can be a general list; not every detail);###.  Despite your multiple requests that he remove the property during [state the years when you recall doing this--###0###6, ###0###7, . . . whatever], he has declined to do so;###.  You consider the property LEGALLY ABANDONED, and that you now have the right to dispose of it;5.  But as a COURTESY, you are giving him ###, and if after that date the items have not been removed, you will dispose of them. 6.  Be sure to put a date on the letter and a specific date by which the items need to be removed -- to eliminate any uncertainty.7.  Provide your address where the items are stored so that he cannot claim he forgot where you lived and didn't know how to comply.8.  State the amount of notice he must give you before he comes to get his things (for example ###, ###-days, something reasonable that works for you)--to avoid surprise visits.9.  State that the notice must be in writing and state the method for giving you notice -- for example, e-mail, text, whatever you feel comfortable with--and give that contact information to him.  You can even set up a new Gmail account just for this purpose if you don't want to give out your personal contact information. ###" or anything you like.As I said given the amount of time that has passed I do not think it is your responsibility to track him down and send this letter.  This is just something to give yourself some peace of mind--if you choose--that you have done everything you can to be responsible with his things.Before you dispose of anything:###.  Make a detailed record. Write down the following information in the event he comes back one day and attempts some type of legal claim:The ### he left the items at your propertyA detailed list of what he left behindAs best you can remember -- the dates (or years) and the number of times you asked him to remove his thingsAs best you can remember -- the dates (or years) and number of times he has been to your house (to visit) after leaving his things--but not taking them.As best you can remember -- the date (### or year) when you had your last contact with himAs of this date (of your record) you do not know where he lives or how to contact him. He has not provided you a forwarding address or contact information.###.   TAKE PHOTOS of everything before you dispose of it.I would not expect a judge to rule in his favor under these facts so it is important that you have a record to show a judge.  Hopefully it will never come to this.If I can identify a specific time period for when property is considered "abandoned" in a case like yours I will let you know.  There may not be a specific law for private individuals.  Normally there are just laws for landlords (and you're not a landlord unless you had a written lease with him).Thjs is a long response with a lot of detail but I hope it is helpful.Let me know if you have any questions. RegardsLinda"43884.6680555556 Jamelle,I wanted to add two more things:Given the history of your relationship, and the fact that you had to block him on social media to avoid continuing harassment, you may want to consider the options that best protect you from resurrecting another pattern of harassment.###.  Contact through e-mail:  If you decide you want to send your ex a written notice -- and you do it by e-mail because that's the only way you know how to contact him -- I would recommend setting up a new and separate e-mail address (for example, through Gmail) for the specific purpose of contacting him about his property.  You may want to keep this matter separate and out of your personal everyday e-mails.  Once the matter is resolved, you can just abandon that e-mail address you created for this.###.  Personal contact at your house:  If you do not feel comfortable having him come to your home to collect his things, two options you have are (###) just consider the property abandoned and dispose of it without giving him any notice (and follow my instructions for making a detailed record beforehand); or (###) take the property to a different address (friend or family member) where he can collect it while you are not there.  But if you think he's going to harass that friend or family member, then go back to option (###) and just dispose of the property.You may want to add to your written record any details you can about how you felt harassed and had to cut off communications with him.Again, let me know if you have any questions.Linda43884.6854166667 Jamelle,Regarding the unwanted mail -- I do not think you have many options, unfortunately, because mail sent through the US postal service is so highly protected by federal law.You can ask at the Post Office what your options are, but my guess is, the most you can do is write REFUSED" on the unopened envelope and put it back in the mailbox.  It's important you DO NOT OPEN the mail.  One -- if it's not addressed to you it could be a federal offense to open it without your ex's consent and Two -- you can't give it back to the postal service (even if you reseal it) without putting it into a new envelope addressed to the sender and with the proper postage.But ask at the Post Office if they have other solutions for you.Linda"43884.7131944444 Me and my ex have been broken up for years since 2016. I tried to get him to get his stuff from my house and he made so many excuses as to why he can't. He is even still getting mail sent to my house till this day. I tried for a whole year to get him to get his stuff and he made excuses. I have moved on and I know this is just another controlling tactic of his to try to stay in my life. He would even casually contact me as if we are friends and wanting to be ### about who I am seeing or had in my home but never inquired about his stuff in my home. I ended up blocking him on my phone and social media because he was becoming a nuisance and I want nothing to do with him when our relationship is over with. I gave up when I gave him enough time to collect his belongings and tried to be civil. One day he even showed up at my house years later but I didn't let him in because I know this man and I know all he wants is to try to get back into a relationship with me and use me for a place to stay. I once years ago threatened to throw away everything if he didn't come and get it and he said he would sue me if I did even through he purposely didn't collect his belongings. His stuff as of ###'m tired of seeing it. I was once advised to send a letter to him giving him notice but I don't know where he has been living since I have blocked him out my life. If I decide to throw away his belongings that he refused to get even years later can I get into any kind of legal trouble?43884.5513888889 Me and my ex was never married but only just had a relationship for three years before we parted ways. As far as the items he left behind, they are for the most part only clothes and a little bit of shoes and a little bit of hygiene products. The only thing I ever paid for was just a little bit of clothes like a few shirts that I had once given him as a gift but that's it. Other than that there was nothing like any electronics he left behind. As of now I do not have any kind of contact for him as far as a address because I do not know where he is staying and I have not talked to him in years now. I do have a phone number that he contacted me from that I tired to block from my phone although the phone does not ring if he ever called and goes straight to voicemail. I have ignored his few contacts since ###. He has tried at least a few times each year to contact me but never once inquired about collecting his stuff. 43884.7451388889 Thanks, Jamelle, for those details.  That puts it into better perspective.Just dispose of those items as you see fit.  They have very little value, if any.I suggest you just take a photo of everything before you dispose of the items and keep it for any future reference.It still wouldn't hurt to write down the simple facts about when he moved out, etc.  And put a date on it (the date you write down the record). I don't think you will ever need the photo or the list of facts, but it will give you peace of mind knowing that you have a record in the unlikely event you will need it.The only legal action he could take would be to file some type of lawsuit for the value of the items (which would fail), and clearly it wouldn't even be worth the filing fees at the court, so I don't see him doing that.He might try calling the police, but they would not be able to do anything except file a report, which would be pretty useless.  The property was left in your house.  You didn't physically take it from anyone or break into someone else's property to get it.  The police can only handle criminal matters, and this wouldn't be a criminal matter, it would be a civil matter. But if it comes to that, that's when it would be useful for you to show the police the photo of the things he left behind and the written facts of when he left, etc.  You also would want to explain how and why you had to break off communications with him.  Your ex probably doesn't have any tangible evidence of his own to show (like a photo or an inventory or receipts), so you'd be the only one with any useful evidence that anyone could base a decision on.I hope that helps.Let me know if you have any questions.Linda43884.7854166667 You are very welcome, Jamelle.Best of luck,Linda43884.8652777778 ###, I just want to show you this link on the Civil Justice website where they discuss helping people with modifying child support orders.http://www.civiljusticenetwork.org/Programs/LimitedScopeProject/PetitiontoModifyChildSupport.aspxThis is just to let you know that this is an issue they can help with.  But as I said, you need to first get your child support order registered with the appropriate court and then seek modification.  Hopefully, they can help.Linda43904.78125 ###,I am sorry that you are still not getting the answers you need.If you want to send me a copy of the support order, I will try to contact the court in New York (or the appropriate child support enforcement agency) to ask the question one more time about whether you can file a petition there to have the support order modified. Sometimes you have to ask a question three different ways before you get the right answer.  If New York continues to say it does not have jurisdiction, hopefully there is a way to get Maryland to help.If you want my help:###.  Attach a scanned or ### copy of your child support order here -- make sure it's legible.###.  Can you give me the phone number you called in NY to find about any search warrants?  What was the name of the agency you called?###.  Can you copy and paste the Maryland website link that has the FAQs about non-custodial parents applying for voluntary support payments?If you want to move forward on your own or find someone else to help, that's fine, too.  Just let me know, and I will close out this matter.Thanks,Linda43889.61875 ###,I don't know if you've had a chance to call the Maryland child support Customer Care Call Center yet, or if you got the answers you need, but I went ahead and called them this morning.The woman on the phone told me the same thing that you were told--that there was nothing they could do in Maryland until the custodial parent registers the support order and seeks enforcement.What she advised was that you go back to the court in New York that established the order to seek modification through them.  I explained to her that you already reached out to New York, and that they told you they no longer had jurisdiction over the order.  She responded by saying that they probably still have jurisdiction to handle it because the mother has not registered the support order in Maryland, which would have transferred jurisdiction to Maryland.  So, jurisdiction still lies with the original New York court.Afterwards, I called the NC Child Support Enforcement Agency (Customer Service Center at 1-800-###), and they told me the same thing, that you need to reach out to the court in New York.  It's possible NY turned you away because they incorrectly assumed that jurisdiction was transferred to Maryland.  If you make it clear that the order has not been registered in Maryland, and that NY still has jurisdiction, you may get a different answer from them.The man I spoke to at the NC Customer Service Center recommended that you go into a local NC Child Support Enforcement Agency office and ask them for advice on how you can reach out to the New York court in a way that gets you the result you want.  They cannot do much more than that for you because the child support order has never been registered in NC, and NC does not have any sort of jurisdiction over the matter.   But they certainly can help you to reach out to NY yourself.If that does not get you anywhere, you can send me a copy of the child support order, and I will try to call the court in New York to get some answers.Let me know if you have any questions.Linda43888.6298611111 ###,I'm just sending a message to keep this matter from closing.  I received an e-mail from the ABA last night saying the matter would close in the next ###.Things are shutting down everywhere, and the courts are limiting their activity, too.  So, I don't know how much can be accomplished in the near ###.  But hopefully you're getting some type of response from the Civil Justice people.

Can you explain that a little more?  Has she filed some type of action in the Maryland court with respect to the NY child support order?  Or was she trying to initiate an entirely new child support action?  What was that about and what was the outcome?  If she had court appearances related to the NY child support order I would expect that the order had to be registered.What can you tell me about that?Linda"43884.8930555556 ###,Thanks for the additional information.  That was helpful.  Which court in Maryland?  What's the specific name of the court and in which county?I would try calling the Maryland Customer Care Call Center at ###-800-### to see if you can get some specific answers.  There has to be a way for you to modify this support order without having to wait for the mother to initiate some type of action.  Otherwise, you're just in limbo and stuck with an out-dated order that doesn't apply to the current circumstances.It seems to me, the process is first to register the support order and then file a motion seeking to modify it.###.  Registration of an out-of-state support order for the purpose of modification--by A" PartyIf you read ###0-348 which I attached previously it says "A PARTY or support enforcement agency SEEKING TO MODIFY or to modify and enforce a child support order issued in another state SHALL REGISTER that order in this State in the same manner provided in Â§Â§ ###0-### ###0-###."

Can you provide more detail about this?ThanksLinda"43894.6409722222 Hello, ###,I am sure this must be very frustrating to you, particularly when you are trying to do the right thing and comply with the law.I agree with what others have told you that the State of Maryland now has jurisdiction over the child custody and support order.  There is not much we can do from the State of North Carolina.Since I am not licensed to practice law in Maryland, I am limited in the type of advice I can give you.  However, having done a little research, I am not certain why you were not able to register the New York child support order in Maryland.  It does not make sense to me that only the custodial parent in Maryland could do that, since either party is entitled to seek a modification under the proper circumstances.  It doesn't make sense that your ability to do that would be blocked by the other parent not registering the order. This is what I can advise:###.  Call the Maryland Department of Human Services. They have a division that handles child support issues, and hopefully they can advise you on the procedure for modifying your child support order.

Statutes and Forms for Registering and Modifying Out-of-State Child Support OrdersAttached are the Maryland statutory provisions and form for registering and modifying an out-of-state child support order.  The Form DR ### custody" order as opposed to a child "support" order but sometimes they are one and the same and I did not find a separate form for registering a child support order.  In any event the information required on DR ###.  So it could be that DR ###.I don't know if you found these already or if this is what you tried to submit to the Maryland court. But as I read the statutes and the Form they seem broad enough to allow either parent to register an out-of-state order.When you speak to someone at the Maryland DHR ask them specifically about these statutory provisions and the Form DR 79--and whether and how they apply to your case.###.  Speak to a lawyer licensed in Maryland.If possible you might want to re-post your question on ABA Free Legal Answers for Maryland.  Or -- seek out other legal services in Maryland.

These are difficult times for everyone.I received a message today that the ABA Forum will close out this matter if it remains inactive.  I don't know if you have any news, but I still come to the conclusion that your best (if not only) option is to get your NY child support order registered in ### County so you can request the court in ### to modify the support order.The only suggestions I have are:###.  Try to appeal to the mother to register the support order herself, since it seems everyone is saying she needs to be the one to do that. If possible, send her the Form DR ###.  I am attaching them again here.###.  Contact the Civil Justice, Inc. organization in ### to ask if they can find a way for you to register the support order yourself -- or to compel the mother to register it.###.

She agreed with my original assessment, which was that Maryland is the only state that can have jurisdiction over the matter and who can make a decision to modify the support order.  She did not know why Maryland was refusing.  It did not make sense to her, either.What has the person at the federal OCSE in ### told you?  What has he tried?It's still not clear to me what the NC Child Support Enforcement Agency tried to do on your behalf, since you don't have a copy of the papers they tried to file in Maryland.  That would be helpful to know, but you have said that you think the paperwork or file has been lost.In any event, I think this matter has to go directly to the MD family court having jurisdiction and not through the MD child support enforcement agency, since they seem to be giving the wrong advice.I have read the Maryland and NY statutes, and I'm convinced that (###) NY does not have jurisdiction, and (###) the Maryland law allows for you to register your support order with the appropriate Maryland court (probably the Circuit Court for ### County) and to ask that court to modify your support order at the same time you register it.  What I am confused about is why there is no form for registering an out-of-state support order -- only a form for registering an out-of-state custody order, which is not the same thing. So, I'm back to my original advice, which is to reach out to a lawyer in Maryland who would have experience in this area.  I found this organization in the ### area called Civil Justice, Inc., and it looks like they might be able to help you either for free or at a very low cost.  They help people with family law issues, including modification of child support.  Hopefully, they can help with registering an out-of-state child support order, too, which is what you need to do before you can seek a modification.You can call or complete an online intake form, and someone will help you figure out how you can get this done.  If they can't help, I would ask them to refer you a lawyer in the ### area who can.Civil Justice, Inc.###. ### Street, Ste. ######0###, Maryland #########0###E-mail: ###Tel:  ###Intake: ###Online Intake Form: http://www.civiljusticenetwork.org/ForConsumers/Intakeform.aspxThe main facts you need to tell them are:###.

Custodial parent and children moved over ###. I rwcently moved out of NY to NC about ###. Since I moved I've been trying to get ordered registered in MD and NC. MD refuses to register order saying  custodial parent has to put in a request. At first, MD kept say8ng custodial parent didn't live in MD which was not true as the custodial parent has had support appearances in MD court. Also, NC keeps telling me there's nothing they can do. I've even called NY and they said there is nothing they can do, no longer in their jurisdiction. I need to have my order modified. One child turned ###. My finances drastically changed. The custodial parent, for almost ###, refuses to communicate with me or reach out to child support to get this resolved.. I don't know what else to do to get this resolved. Now in arrears $###. Also, can't  get permit because of arrears and afraid there may now be an arrest warrant. Trying to do the right thing, but no one cares or wants to help straighten things out.43884.7027777778 Thank you for all your help. I spoke with someone from child support, I believe it was the program director, and she told me the same. Only the custodial parent can request child support, but on their own website it says I can apply. They denied me and now I need to find out why. It clearly says on their site under FAQs the non-custodial parent can apply for child support to have voluntary wages withheld. I tried to contact NY to find out if I have a warrant, but I wasn't able to get anyone. They are misinterpreting their own rule and it's not right. I'm waiting to speak with someone in the federal office regarding my order since Maryland is blocking me from doing what is right. NY already confirmed they no longer have jurisdiction.43889.0291666667 Thank you for your answer.  What I meant about the custodial parent having appearances is when I was living in NY and I had to go to court for a modification she would have to show up to court in MD for conference call since she was not able to come to NY. This went on for years. I acutally had NC child support enforcement agency attempt to register the order with MD thinking this would be the easiest, but NC kept getting the runaround from the MD. MD even said the custodial parent lives in NC which is not true. Then I received notice months later stating MD refuses to register the order because the custodial parent hasn't requested services.43885.9791666667 Thank you, ###.  Those answers and documents are helpful to understand the entire picture.I am sorry you are going through this.  That is really unfortunate that they block your ability to get a driver's permit/license, since that could affect your ability to be employed and to pay the child support.  It's counter-productive, in my opinion.A couple questions:###.  ### Fortune -- can you tell me the name of the agency he works with?  Hopefully, he will be the one to crack this case.###.
