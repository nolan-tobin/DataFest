### my car stalled out on the highway and I got it towed to an auto repair shop.The auto repair shop â€œfixedâ€ something but it didnâ€™t fix the problem.

I had to pay for another tow back to the auto repair shop. They are blaming everything but themselves! When I was told they did a complete inspection and my car is still having problems.

He came over and I paid him to fix it.  He fixed it and then i had another issue with my car.  I left him the money and he came by and got the money but never fixed the car.  For weeks, he gave me excuses.  So finally I took it to a shop and they told me the problem was caused from him doing a poor welding job to the catalytic converter.  So now I have to fix that.  He ignores my calls now.  He owes me the money for the repair and parts I bought.  Also he owes me the money he took.  I have on recordings agreeing to do the task and admitting he got paid.  I want him to reimburse what it will cost to fix the car.  Im taking this to smalls claims court and I'm wondering if I have a case.  Is this worth pursuing?43640.8611111111 ### I brought my car to jiffy lube to be fixed under a credit that I was supposed to sign a contract for the contract was sign by the jiffy lube not me and they went to charge ### have a running car they fix cosmetic stuff in the car instead of the insult problem as I had and now they want me to pay ### even have a car and they already send the contract to the finance company as if the car is already fixed. I donâ€™t know what to do to get out of situaciÃ³n and thought I could use a lawyer 43656.5118055556 I am sorry you are going through this.  It sounds like you are saying that you had a credit and you decided to use that at Jiffy Lube and only authorized them to perform certain repairs, in the order you described (making the car run first, and then move on to the brakes and tires) to use up the credit you had.  Is that right?  First, they cannot sign a contract for you, unless you authorized them to do so.  They also cannot perform work on your vehicle unless you (or someone with the authority to give it) gave them authority.  I am a little confused about how they were performing work on your car without your authorization.  Was the authorization in the contract that they gave you and they signed instead of you?  Did you agree to it?  What did the contract say that they should do for the work?  An important question is: who has the car now?  When a place like Jiffy Lube does work on a vehicle, they often have what is called a mechanic's lien" on the vehicle so they can keep it until they are paid.  The reason I ask is to figure out what your next steps may be.  If they are saying you owe something to them but you have your car then it is up to them to try to collect from you.  You could seek something from the court if you want called a "declaratory judgment" stating that you do not owe them anything but that will involve filing a lawsuit.  If they still have your car the question is whether you want them to continue working on your car or give it back so you can take it somewhere else.  The next question would be what happens with the credit.  One option might be you contacting the finance company to tell them that you did not authorize that work on the car so it should not pay Jiffy Lube for it but then Jiffy Lube may come after you for it.  Before doing that you would want to make sure that you have everything right to make sure that you did not actually authorize them to use the credit.  I think you need to sit down with a lawyer and explain the situation in more detail so you can get more specific advice.  You could reach out to the NC Bar Association Lawyer Referral Service or if you qualify you could contact Legal Aid of North Carolina.

There is nothing you can do to make your grandson pay.I recommend that you consult with a good bankruptcy attorney near you.  Many charge either no consultation fee, or a very modest one.

I agree with your analysis that the charges should not be charged to you under the loan agreement.  It is unclear from your email why you lost income as a result of the title being lost.  However, if the bank accepted liability for your lost wages and is simply denying the wages based on proof, I would refocus your effort on the documents you provided.  In a typical lost wage claim, we provide tax returns, W-2s, time sheets, or an affidavit from the claimant's supervisor.  If you are self-employed, profit and loss (income statements) and tax returns from the prior ###.  If you do not have formal profit and loss statements, you could send bank statements.  Although the consumer affairs department of the Attorney General's Office will not likely pursue the lost income claim, they might be interested in contacting the lender regarding the improper fee charges.  You could also contact the Office of Comptroller and ###, which is a federal agency that oversees bank ###, here:Contact the Customer Assistance GroupSpecialists are available in English or Spanish Monday - Friday | ### to ### CSTPhone: ###TDD Number: ###TTY: ### (via a relay service)Since PNC Bank is not a ### bank, the NC Commissioner of Banks may not be much help, but you could contact them at: ###As a last resort, you can file a small claim against the bank in your county.  There may be an issue as to whether the bank can be sued in small claims court in your venue, but I think it is worth a shot.  If the small claims magistrates finds that he/she does not have jurisdiction, you will need to file a district court action. 43704.7166666667 Thank you for taking my question. I recently purchased a vehicle for business purposes in relation to my only source of possible income. The bank in which I have the loan through lost the vehicle title back on ###th, ###. The bank requested a new title from the previous owner and received the duplicate title ###th, ###. In accordance with the ### Note and Security Agreement regarding the loan, the bank takes ownership over the title for the vehicle and power of attorney for processing the title as I" listed as the new registered owner. In conjunction the bank as a part of the loan process charged me with the entire DMV fee associated with the transition. Since the bank lost the original title they are now taking the position of no responsibility. Yet initially agreed to settle for my lost income and requested I submit a proposal with proof of lost income. Submitting everything they requested they concluded I did not prove loss of income and therefore would not reimburse for lost income.The banks executive staff has since mailed me the duplicate title with the claim it is my sole responsibility to process my own paperwork in regards to the finalizing of the loan process. Thus extorting money from me by charging fees they never ultimately pay. The contracts do not state it is my responsibility until the loan is paid in full. And the notion is confirmed by staff members that directly process the loan paperwork. Additionally the staff members notes the executive staff are not knowledgeable on the loan processes but make decisions that override their authority. Furthermore the banks executive staff has made changes to the ###s of the loan without my authorization knowledge or signature in agreement to the changes. Still demanding I pay the loan.Summarizing my legal issue. The banks breach of contract and loss of title has caused me to lose my only source of income and have completely depleted my resources. It has caused countless counts of defamation to my name and my business with my inability to pay other creditors. Resulting in the transition to bankruptcy for both business and personal.Thank you in advance for your time. Any help you can provide will be helpful. If you are unable to help me I kindly ask to then please refer me to someone that could assist my case.

Timeshares are rarely a good investment, and often times the sales process can be somewhat ###.  Unfortunately you will likely not be able to get your $15,###.  What you can do in this situation will be dictated by the timeshare governing documents.  Often times these agreements require the timeshare owners to pay annual maintenance fees in addition to the purchase price, adding to the cost of ownership.  If you are unable to sell the timeshare to someone else or have Wyndham repurchase the interest (unlikely), you could just refrain from paying the maintenance fees which will likely result in Wyndham foreclosing on the timeshare interest.  However, you should NOT do this if the timeshare governing documents make you personally liable for the maintenance fees (i.e. Wyndham could come after you for any amounts owed).You should also be wary of companies promising to get you out of the timeshare.  You should only agree to let these companies do so if you only pay them when they actually find a buyer.  Do NOT pay any money to them upfront.  43690.7486111111 I was unable to keep up on payments for my car and it was repossessed.

Bankruptcy eligibility depends on a lot of things, including factoring in the date and type of any prior bankruptcy you filed, and your household income.

It's a good opportunity for you to explain in detail your financial situation -- your debts, income, property, and overall situation -- find out your options, the pros and cons, and have any questions answered.

However, if you were induced into entering a contract based on upon certain representations, and those representations were false, then you have a legal claim of fraudulent ### and the remedy for your client is rescission of the contract.  Essentially, if someone gets you to sign a contract by providing false information, then you have a right to have the contract set aside and your deposit returned.  You could also seek damages for any amounts you spent in reliance on this contract.  The focus of the court will probably be on how significant the misrepresentations were.   If they were small things, then the Court might not be inclined to let you out.  If the misrepresentations were significant, you have a better shot.

The answer to your question depends on the specific language of your purchase agreement, and what it says about warranties of fitness, and implied and express warranties.  It is impossible to say without knowing the entire contents of your contract.  In contract law, there are specific rules regarding when a warranty is disclaimed, and to what extent it is disclaimed, depending on the language.  Usually, the contract's written format also precludes any uses of verbal statement by the dealer as a warranty on which the buyer can rely.  Many lawyers will be glad to review the paperwork for you for limited consultation purposes for a small fee for their time in reading everything over carefully.  I am not saying that you necessarily need that if you feel confident in your ability to interpret the language of the contract yourself, but if you would like a little more legal expertise than can be provided in a website like this, I recommend a brief consultation and document review with a lawyer who handles contracts and ### law.  Then you can get the most precise answer to your question.  I would move on this sooner rather than later, should you decide to seek detailed legal advice.Best wishes to you in this matter.

Following the purchase of the car at the Auction I presume you received a North Carolina title certificate issued in your own name. If you did receive a title certificate issued in your own name and that was misplaced you will need to go to the North Carolina DMV and apply for a "duplicate title".  The required documents are a (i) lien release (if the title had shown any liens on the car) and (ii) a completed Application for Duplicate Title (###) available at https://www.ncdot.gov/dmv/downloads/Documents/###.pdf. To complete that application you will require the vehicle description (year make style model VIN and the title number and a current odometer reading). This can be done in person (you'll need to show ID) or by mail.  In either case the DMV places a ### - so please be aware this is not a ### process. There is also a $###. You do not need the car present for this process.  If you never had a North Carolina title in your own name and you cannot prove that you own the vehicle the North Carolina DMV would be referring you to  a "bonded title". To get this from the North Carolina DMV you will need to take several actions such as submit a Title Application submit an Affidavit of Facts to Accompany Indemnity Bond and provide an Indemnity Bond.  The full list is at ###. But as you indicated the vehicle needs to be located in North Carolina for that approach.  We may be able to better and more further answer the question if you please let us know exactly what documentation was misplaced. In any event you will then need to register the car in Maryland.

I believe you are correct in your thinking that this is a civil lawsuit pending.  Once you are served, you have ### (likely).  Depending on what you wish to do, you can either file (###) an Answer that addresses each of the paragraph allegations in the plaintiff's Complaint; (###) a Motion to Dismiss under Rule ###; (###) a combination of an Answer and a Motion to Dismiss, consolidated; or (###) a Motion to Extend Time (assuming you do so within your initial ###; this will provide you with an additional ###).  I would strongly recommend that you at least consult with a lawyer once on this matter, even if you do not have the resources to retain one for length and duration of the lawsuit.  Hopefully you can reach some compromise agreement with the lender, in order to cut short the lawsuit upon satisfying certain conditions the plaintiff might seek in exchange for not pursuing the lawsuit to its ultimate conclusion.It is possible, though not guaranteed, that your house could be in jeopardy due to this debt.  Typically, the lender in mortgage or deed of trust situation would have first priority lien against a house, but if you owe no debt on your house itself, it is likely that the plaintiff in this case will become a ### lienholder against your property should you fail to resolve the lawsuit with a settlement beforehand.  Under N.C.G.S.

You will need to speak in greater detail about these undesirable ### with a civil litigation lawyer as the entire process is a bit too complicated to fully address online.I hope you can soon work something out that will help you resolve this lawsuit early and save your most valuable assets from judgment and collection.Blessings to you this fall.### A. ### ### Esq."43721.1034722222 I stopped paying my ### bills since last year September.I found a sheriff note for serving information about civil summon.

Unfortunately, this is nothing that warrants a lawsuit.  Lawsuits require actual damages by the plaintiff in order to go forward (since legal injuries is what lawsuits are intended to provide remedies for), and also, lenders may periodically check a borrower's credit score in order to update its information pertaining to the ### of the borrower.  This is likely contained somewhere in your contract, but even if it is not, it is permissible as long as the credit inquiry is for a ### purpose, and is not for mere intrusion or harassment.  This is fairly standard for ### in car loan, ### loan, business loan and related contexts.I see nothing illegal or improper here based on what you have written.  I recommend carefully re-reading every part of your contract for a better understanding.  You can also sign up for credit alerts through Experian, which will send you biweekly or monthly email updates about anything going on with your credit file.  If the alerts suggest that something improper is going on, you can log into your Experian profile and examine it more closely, then confront the agency making the inquiry if needed.  (TransUnion and Equifax might also have similar services and email alert systems, but Experian is the one with which I am most familiar.)Best wishes to you this fall.  I wish you well in paying down this obligation in a timely and manageable manner.  Have a safe and productive fall season.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43722.1027777778 I have a loan out with security finance and when I don't make the payment on time this office with check my credit report without my consent saying they're trying to see if I have any thing else open recently as to why my payment is late. I've spoken to the district manager the first time and they are trying to tell me that they have the right to do this and it's in my contract. The only thing about payments being late in my contract is about the late fees. I would like to know if I can take them to court about this matter because this can not be legal.Thank you43721.8395833333 Good evening, ###:Thank you for this question.  Either you or a lawyer you hire for this matter should contact ### in writing to dispute the $###.###, and to demand that the co###y specifically identify the legal basis for claiming that debt if it sincerely believes it to be proper and legitimate.  The written communication (letter, email) should put forth your ### reasons as to why you believe you do not owe the sum, and that you would like to know why the co###y is demanding this sum so that you can determine whether it has any basis in law or fact.If the letter comes fro###lawyer, it will probably have stronger teeth to it because a lawyer's letter will also note the consequences of pursuing an illegitimate debt, and how doing so can incur civil liability for fraud and other civil claims should the co###y proceed in bad faith, on a claim it knows is unlawful or unjustified.  Hopefully a strong rebuttal, communicated in good faith and in a professional manner (and by a lawyer, if you can afford one to send such a letter), will put this matter to rest, without any further collection proceedings, small claims litigation, or other unpleasant consequences that you do not deserve.I hope this helps.  Hopefully you will not have to deal with this nonsense for long.Best wishes to you,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43728.0236111111 I worked for an insurance company, ###, for approximately four months. It has been almost one month since I quit, and I have received a letter from them claiming that I owe the company $###. I do not believe this is fair and to me, it seems like a Ponzi scheme. What can I do here? Is there anything I can do?43727.8097222222 Good evening, Mrs. ###:I hope you are well as fall comes upon us.  You ask some very good questions, and I have previously represented clients in situations similar to yours against the same law firm that is pursuing ### debt against you.  I will try to explain each aspect you raised, in a concise but informative way.First, you should look to N.C.G.S. Chapter 1C as to what forms of property are exempt.  You have ###.  A readable list of exemptions to be claimed can be found at this link to N.C.G.S. Â§ ###:https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_1C/GS_###.pdfIf ### debt is only against you and not your husband, it cannot proceed against your husband's house, unless you very recently conveyed your interest to hi### a ###s of avoiding the debt (in which case this can be construed as a fraudulent conveyance and can be overturned through legal action).  Otherwise, the house is safe.You are entitled to the first $3,###, under Â§ ###(a)(3).  The fact that the bank still owns" the vehicles is irrelevant if your name is on the car loan.The question of the contents of your home is tricky because there is an academic answer and a practical answer.  The academic answer is that under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###(a)(4) you can protect your household furnishings up to $5### plus $1### (not to exceed $4###); you can also protect up to $2### implements tools etc. related to your profession or trade or those of a dependent under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###(a)(5).  The practical answer however is that debtors rarely pursue household contents and furniture as aggressively as they do real estate vehicles and cash assets which are much easier to sell or collect respectively from the creditor's point of view.I am less sure about your 401(k).  I know that IRAs and annuities referenced in N.C.G.S. Â§ ###(a)(9) and more particularly described under Internal Revenue Code sections 408(a) and 408(b) are mostly shielded from creditors as well as ### Â§ ###(10).  Lastly if you have retirement plans from other states it is highly possible that they are protected under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###(a)(11).  You may wish to call a local CPA and confirm for certain whether your 401(k) is protected (and be sure to have a beneficiary designated if you have not already because otherwise your estate would eventually receive the proceeds which could make them potentially vulnerable to creditors getting part or all of the same after your death).I hope this helps you a little.  Read the judgments statute very carefully and this will go a long way in helping you correctly and properly claiming exempt property within your allotted ###.  Act timely and properly in order to preserve your exemption rights under North Carolina law.Blessings to you and your family this fallBrandon A. Robinson ### Esq."43728.9888888889 I have a judgment filed against me from Discover credit card. I called the law office who is handling it months ago and offered ###,### ###. They said no. Then I told them I have other credit cards that Iâ€™m paying off right now where I pay out ######0.###. I offered ######0.###â€™m done with the program Iâ€™m in for other debt. They said no. Now I have been served with a form of exemptions designated. Our home is in my husbands name. Can they do anything with my home since itâ€™s not in my name? And once I fill out the form what exactly can they take? We have ###? Can they touch my ###? I donâ€™t own anything of value outright. The banks own the home and the cars. And since my name is not on the mortgage could they take anything inside the home? All we have is what is in our home. We have a timeshare but there are ###. I tried to work with them and want this settled but they were the ones who didnâ€™t want to work with me. I thought about bankruptcy but Iâ€™ve already settled most of it and only have discover and another one and donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth bankruptcy. So I guess my question is what exactly can they take in my home if my name is not on the mortgage? And since the bank owns the vehicles can they take them? I will try and call them but I had no luck with them previously. Thank you so much for youâ€™re time. 43728.7020833333 I think you are likely right about the 401k; I just wanted you to confirm that a little more precisely.  As best I could tell when I conducted some legal research before responding to your question, it appears that the exemptions statute would treat a 401k similarly to an ### or employee benefit plan as previously discussed in my initial answer.  I think any vehicle besides your primary vehicle is fair game, even if they have to liquidate the vehicle and return a portion to your husband after garnishing your share.  I think you are making very reasonable efforts to settle this matter with them, but ultimately they do not have to accept offers short of full satisfaction, lump sum, if they do not want to do so.  What they ultimately want is a judgment for the entire amount in order to preserve their rights to go after any and all amounts not paid, even if they do not do so immediately.  Judgments are good for ten years, subject to another ten years after that if it is properly renewed.  Best wishes, and I hope this goes well in the end.43731.6395833333 One last quick question. If the vehicles are in mine and my husbands name can they go after them? Iâ€™m planning on setting up some kind of payment but when I contact them I want to know what Iâ€™m talking about. I felt my offer to them was fair, and wanted it resolved and they just didnâ€™t care. I mean, I offered a monthly payment starting October and here we are almost October and they have nothing from me. From what I researched they cannot touch my 401k because it is a company and not a personal retirement plan and not an ###. If I understood it correctly. So not sure what they think I have of value if I owe ###. Well, thank you again for youâ€™re time. I will be calling them tomorrow. 43731.2576388889 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:If you cannot afford a lawyer for the long ###, I would still consult with one briefly so that you can have a more full discussion than is possible in online forums like this one.  However, I will note that, unless this ten-year-old debt was under notarized seal, the statute of limitations would have expired for the plaintiff to pursue this claim under N.C.G.S. Â§ 1-52(1).  This assumes that the breaching condition happened more than three years ago.  (Note that contracts under seal have a much ### ### of limitations under N.C.G.S. Â§ 1-47(2) ).A lawyer, in a ### consultation, can quickly review the plaintiff's complaint and summons, and inform you whether you have any valid defenses, procedural objections or counterclaims that might either lead to early dismissal of the lawsuit, or at least ### away at the plaintiff's case.  This will then inform you by the end of the initial discussion of what you need to file within your 30-day window to ### defend yourself.  Note also that if you file a Motion to Extend Time within the first ###, you automatically get a 30-day extension from the Clerk.  You would have to file the Motion and serve a ### copy on the opposing lawyer, along with a Certificate of Service under Rule ###, attesting to the fact that you mailed a copy of the motion to said person, at an address identified in the paper.  You would then list your own contact information (mailing address, email, phone number) under your signature line.  Read Rule ###, and see a link to the same below:###Your chances of making headway in this serious matter are much more probable if you get some guidance in person fro### experienced civil litigation lawyer.  I hope you can find the resources to at least explore your possibilities with local litigation counsel.

What happens if the collection agency applies  to the ### County Court for the relief demanded in the complaint. This debt is ###. Thank you, ### ###43731.8847222222 First I would talk to your existing lawyer and ask them to explain the miscommunication about your court date on the 30th. If he cant provide a satisfactory explanation about the reason why you weren't informed of the continuance then you need to file a compliant against him or her with the North Carolina State Bar.   That may trigger a response form the lawyer that helps clear this up.  Next, I would contact the clerk of court of Guilford county and ask why you weren't served any papers for your court date.  If may be they are sending papers to your attorney or they have the wrong address for you.  You can also try to explain to the clerk that you are an indigent defendant and have no ability to pay the fines and see if there is any other alternative for you. 43735.7215277778 Hi,So I missed court in ### County due to having my ###.

Well it's the end of the day and the ### came to me and asked my name and said that the same lawyer had it continued and that I needed to a with for him to get in touch with me via mail, email or phone with new date. Well only ###'m finding out the day after. The lawyers office is saying they didn't continue it and the court is saying they did. Called DA and was told to turn myself in, do another motion to reschedule and there's nothing she could do about it. I was at court the day I was supposed to be, they messed it up and now I'm having to pay even more money for their mistake. My husband is laid off, I'm unemployed, we have a ###. I have a few cases that I caused when I was still in active addiction ###. So I'm paying for them now. But with no money, no help, no one will give me a court appointed attorney and even was turned down by legal aide. This was my last idea of what to do so I hope you guys can help me or at least give me some really good advice.  Thank you.Also I have ALL documents proving when my court dates where and forms from lawyers office.

No one served papers, nothing in mail, I just happen to look on website one day and saw it 43732.7770833333 From the documentation provided, it appears that the probation officer has worked with you on at least one occasion for a violation.  You have an opportunity during a probation revocation hearing to present your case.  You will,  however, have issues as to what payments were actually made, that you have not yet obtained employment, and the fact that there was a positive drug test. At the hearing, you have to explain why you should not be revoked. You can expect questions as to the number of applications for employment actually submitted, where and when, and efforts made toward payment.  Be prepared to answer those questions, as they will likely be the basis of the determination of any revocation. Unless you can show inability to pay and that nonpayment was not because of a failure to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds for payment, the court can order the suspended sentence activated.  If it appears that the default in the payment of a fine or costs is not because of failure to make a good faith effort to obtain the necessary funds for payment, the court may enter an order: (###) Allowing you additional time for payment; or (###) Reducing the amount of the fine or costs or of each installment; or (###) Revoking the fine or costs or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.The issue of employment discrimination based on your pregnancy status is a separate legal issue.  Under the law, employers cannot discriminate based on your being pregnant, it is a protected class. 43762.6756944444 I'm having to go back to court on the 30th for not paying $### ### ###.

I have scanned all ### .pdf file, which I am attaching to this reply. First, is the Notice of Right (###). Next, is the Motion to Claim Exempt Property (Statutory Exemptions) (###). Last, is the Motion to Claim Exempt Property (Constitutional Exemptions) (###). If you have already filed your Motion to Claim Exempt Property, then you can contact the Clerk of Court in your county to find out the exact date you filed it. If you owe a creditor money and they won a judgment against you in court, then the Motion to Claim Exempt Property is the form you complete in order to stop the sheriff from taking your property. As I stated before, you will either complete the Statutory Exemptions or Constitutional ### on whether you completed it within the ###.You file an Affidavit of Indigency when you are trying to bring a law suit, appeal a small claims action to district court, or file a motion but do not have the money to pay the court costs or fees associated with filing a case.Take care!43746.8729166667 Mr. ###--I want to make sure that I understand your position (and question). Because you listed ### & ### as the opposing counsel, I am assuming a court has entered judgment against you for some type of credit debt or other debt. When that happens, if you do not voluntarily pay, then before a creditor can try to take your property (whether personal property or real ###) then they must give you the chance to protect some or all of it. In order to do so, then must first send you your Notice of Right to Have Exemptions Designated (which can be found here: ###). Along with that, you will receive a Motion to Claim Exempt Property (Statutory Exemptions) (if the judgment was entered on or after ### then the form looks like this: ###). These forms are referred to as your exemption papers" and describes a process under the law where the State has said before a creditor can try to ### your property to satisfy a judgment they have to give you the chance to complete the Motion and file it with the court. There are certain limits that the law allows you to protect for different types of property. BUT in order to protect your allowed property you MUST complete the Motion to Claim Exempt Property send a copy to ### & ### and file it with the Clerk of Court within ###. If you failed to do so then you will lose the right to protect your property at the fullest amount. You may however complete your Constitutional Exemptions by completing the motion found here: ###. The ### exemptions protect less than the statutory exemptions.If you do not know when you received them or filed them with the Clerk of Court then I suggest you call the Clerk and ask. If you do not have the court file number at all then I suggest you visit the clerk of court and try to get help in person. You should always make it a habit of keeping a copy of anything you take or mail to the clerk or to an attorney.If you have already filed an exemption then you do not have to complete a new set of papers UNLESS:You receive another set from the Creditor (a judgment is good for ### ### which means the creditor can send you a Notice of Rights and try to collect several times within ###). ORIf you acquire new property within ### (i.e. if you buy a house car boat etc. within ###). If this is the case then you must inform both the clerk and the creditor that you want to AMEND your Motion.Although you do not have to use a lawyer to complete your exemption papers or amendment to modify you may be eligible for free assistance with completing the forms through Legal Aid of NC. You can call 1-800-### or apply online at www.legalaidnc.org.I hope this information helps!"43741.8333333333 The links you give  ###).,   ###don't appear to be working bring back page about ###43746.8638888889 ###, Sorry to hear about this. Have any actions been commenced against you? Has the card ever gone into default? Are they claiming they are denying your payments and for any reason? If you have made a credit card payment through your user profile with receipts, you should pull your banking records as well. If everything is up to date and they simply have some sort of IT or accounting error you should first and foremost continue to work your way up the customer service ladder. Starting a legal action against the CC company would be costly and take up much of your time. It may be necessary, but consider this your last option. Another option is submitting an official consumer complaint with a government agency overseeing financial institutions. In most cases, they are obligated to investigate and respond. Good luck,###43740.7659722222 Also Re: customer service ladder, Mastercard customer service cannot find the account 43746.8618055556 And you have tried to speak with Bluebird?

Is filing Chapter ###? Thank you, ###43741.7159722222 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for this question.  From my prior litigation experience of debt collection issues (I have been on both sides of the dispute, both debtor and creditor), I think it sounds like you are being asked to sign a Confession of Judgment."  This is basically a shortcut to getting a judgment against you without having to go through a lawsuit first except that whereas a court judgment is immediately entered against your credit record a Confession of Judgment is filed against you only if you fail to honor the payment plan.  If you make all your payments on time the Confession of Judgment will never be filed and it becomes void (be sure to get a notice of Satisfaction and Accord in writing to confirm however if you do make all payments) upon satisfaction of all terms and conditions.Yes an unpaid judgment (either a ### one or a Confession of Judgment) will be very bad for you because it significantly lowers your credit score thereby i###ting your ability in the future to rent apartments or houses in which to live and also will badly affect your eligibility for future bank loans whether for cars houses business or personal needs.  Whether you sign the Confession of Judgment or not you really need to avoid having any type of judgment on your record which at least according to the law as it stands in ### will remain on your record for ten (10) twenty (20) or more years.  If you think you can make monthly payments at a fairly decent installment amount try to negotiate a good deal that you can afford and seriously consider signing the Confession of Judgment.  HOWEVER I warn that if you do so you MUST make the payments and satisfy the conditions or it will be filed with the Clerk of Court and attempts will be made to execute it against your assets after you are given a form to claim statutory exemptions under N.C.G.S. Chapter ### and have been given twenty (20) days to complete it from the day you are personally served with it.Weigh your options carefully and if needed consult with a lawyer at Legal Aid of North Carolina (I believe the closest office to you is in downtown ### but you can check if there is an office in ### County as well).I hope this clarifies some of your questions.

I think you have correctly calculated the amount of legal damages based on the facts you stated in your su###y.  Your best way forward is to sue this business in small claims court, assuming it does not try to make good with you beforehand, per private agreement.  If not, you should sue in the county where the business either maintains its principal ### of business, or where the registered agent has his/her address, depending on whether the business is formally incorporated.  You can do a business name search with the North Carolina Secretary of State at this link: ###.If the business is an unincorporated sole ### or ### partnership, you should sue in the county where the owner(s) live, and serve the### their home address (or in the alternative, at their place of business if you can find them there).  The methods for serving a complaint and summons in a lawsuit are governed by Rule ###, found at this link: https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_1a/gs_1a-1,_rule_###.html.Read Rule ###(j)(1) for how to effectively serve a natural person, and Rule ###(j)(6), (7), and (8), for how to serve legal process on a variety of business types.  Following Rule ###.  Cost for filing a small claims suit is $96.###, plus another $### Office.  Otherwise, you can serve by process server, certified mail or personal delivery as detailed in Rule ###.  If you personally deliver, note that you will need to file an Affidavit of Service with the Clerk before your court date, so make sure you schedule your court date three weeks or more out from the date of filing, to ensure that you have all your ducks in a row before the actual hearing date in front of the small claims magistrate.One of the key issues here is whether the verbal promises after the contract are enforceable since they were not supported by the same original consideration" furnished at the beginning of your contractual relationship; usually the answer would be no due to the fact that these promises would normally be considered "illusory" or "gratuitous" promises but in your case the so-called "benefit test" would apply.  The benefit test which North Carolina courts follow and apply stands for the notion that when a gratuitous or illusory promise that would otherwise be unenforceable due to lack of contemporaneous consideration supports or ### the interests of the party who made the promise the promise will be enforced even without the normally required consideration.  Your persuade the magistrate to award you the additional amounts based on those subsequent verbal promises you described is essential to your getting those amounts above and beyond the contract price so read a little more online about the benefit test theory of consideration and make sure you firmly understand this principle of contract law before you try to argue it in court (you can retain counsel for this if you want although small claims is designed for unrepresented litigants).You can find the "Complaint for Money Owed" and "Alias and ### Summons" at the Clerk of Superior Court's office at the courthouse or at ###.

I have no savings, own no property including no car.Should I declare bankruptcy or just let them charge off the accounts as my SSDI is judgement proof? I also applied for a USDA Rural loan so I can move to a safe place because I am in danger of becoming homeless.43747.8243055556 I'm sorry you find yourself in this situation.  I recommend that you consult with a bankruptcy attorney near you, to discuss your situation in good detail (household assets, debts, and income), hear about your options, the pros and cons of each, and the costs of each, and ask any questions you may have.  Many of us do not charge for a consultation unless you hire us to move forward; others of us charge only a modest consultation fee.  It's the best way to make a good decision.To answer your question as best as I can with little information, even if you are truly judgment proof, bankruptcy still may be your best option.  Judgments are good for ### ###, so this could be hanging over your head for 20+ years.  Bankruptcy will put a stop to all collection activity, including the harassing phone calls and mail.  Further, if you want to protect your SSDI in your bank account after the entry of a judgment, you will have to correctly and timely respond to notices of right to claim exempt property.  This is all likely a headache and hassle you don't need.I hope this helps.  Take care and good luck.43752.7972222222 Absolutely.  I hope all goes well.  Will send you positive energy and thoughts, and prayers as well.  Breathe deeply, practice quiet ###, and carefully ### out your energy to deal with each aspect as needed.  May you get over this speed bump, and come into more ### financial resources in short course.  Be well.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43754.8465277778 Good afternoon, Ms. Sparks:Thank you for this important question.  First, in order to confirm the legitimacy of this debt, you can ask that this ### send you something in writing that identifies the alleged creditor, and reason why the debt is due, and when the debt accrued against you.  Creditors are required under federal debt collection laws to send you a ### demand of payment for legitimate debts.  This will be the first test of whether this is a real, legitimate organization of just another scammer.  Do not provide any social security information or other sensitive information not readily ### over the phone, although you can provide a mailing address for the requested written materials.  If they refuse to do so, I doubt that this is a legitimate debt or creditor.  You can then report this information to the Consumer Protection Division of the NC State Attorney General, as well as to the federal Consumer and Financial Protection Bureau in ###, D.C. If the debt turns out to be legitimate and they are willing to offer you a payment plan, see what you can come up with, as this might prevent you from being sued.  It would be quite adverse for a civil judgment to be entered against you, which can linger on your record for at least ten years if it goes unpaid (subject to renewal for another ten years if the creditor properly renewed).  Note that the creditor MAY ask you to sign a Confession of Judgment" that would be held in trust while you make payments and filed with the ### County Clerk of Superior Court only if you default on the payment plan.  The purpose of a confession of judgment from the creditor's side is to preempt the need for a lawsuit by having the debtor sign a judgment that can be ### and executed should compromise payment plans between creditor and debtor fall apart due to the debtor's inability to pay.  This is not always requested by the creditor (and I would not necessarily bring this up first in conversations with the same) but just be aware that it is often a requirement if the debtor wants to avoid the immediate prospect of being sued.I hope this helps somewhat.  God bless you and help you get through this to a better place.Blessings### A. ### ### Esq."43754.79375 Hi , a debt collector just called me saying I needed to pay $###.### $###.

Sincerely,### ###43755.4486111111 ###, In short, your home will not be at risk. In general, if one spouse files for Chapter 7, ownership interests in real property jointly owned by the couple (including a home) transfers to the other spouse. Here, this means that the bankruptcy law treats it as if you do not own the home for purposes of settling your debts, so you cannot be forced to sell your house. Of course, your husband will still be on the hook for any debts associated with the property and any other debts where both of your names are on it. Hope this helps, and good luck!###Just in case helpful: Here is the language that controls the situation here. It is pretty dense language, but in tandem, they work together to create a real property exemption that applies when a couple owns a home jointly and one of them files for bankruptcy:The commencement of a case under section ###0### ###0### or ###. Such estate is comprised of all the following property wherever located and by whomever held: (###) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c)(###) of this section all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case."  ###.S.C.A.

Sincerely,### ###43755.4534722222 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Everything that you described here sounds like the Sheriff properly did what is allowed in a ### of judgment situation.  I see no errors here based on your brief description, and since you did not file your claim of exemptions, much of what you own is now fair game for execution.  This can include your vehicles (you could have protected your primary vehicle up to $###,###), bank accounts, tangible personal property, and almost anything else that is titled in your name.  I doubt that your Social Security for the children can be touched, although whatever money comes into your bank accounts could be.  North Carolina is very generous to judgment debtors when it comes to exemptions, but if you do not claim them within the twenty (20) days from the date of service of the Notice to Claim Exempt Property there is very little you can do at this point.  I wish I had something more encouraging to offer, but not filing the exemptions is a key missing piece that would have otherwise provided you flexible options to keep at least your most essential assets.I wish you the very best nonetheless, and hope your family can make it through this, and on to better things before long.  Have a blessed fall.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43755.625 I have a judgment against me for a car loan I was the  co borrower.  I didn't file an exemption form.  The sheriff served final notice.

Or can it be construed as a bait and switch?43760.6173611111 Mr. ###:This is an interesting question.  In contract law there is a distinction between unilateral mistake and mutual mistake.  It is entirely fine when both parties realize the written contract was mistake to re-execute a new version, but that does not automatically apply when only one party is raising the issue of mistake.  You have the right to insist that the contract signed is the one honored if that was what you negotiated for in good faith.  If they will not honor what was signed, you have the right to not go through with the contract, and sign up with someone else.  The choice of whether to renegotiate is entirely up to you, based on the facts that you have listed here.  I assume that this situation is as straightforward as related in your fact su###y and post.Hope things work out well for you, either way.Best wishes,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43760.6243055556 Good afternoon, ###:Thank you for your question.  This is potentially problematic for two possible reasons: first, if the written paperwork contains an exclusionary, integration" clause that states that the written memorandum ### and includes all understandings between the dealer and buyer that provision would exclude the verbal statement about ### and you could not legally enforce that statement against the dealer; read the written contract very carefully to see if there is any exclusion of verbal promises not in the actual written instrument.  Second even if the contract's language does not explicitly exclude verbal promises made about warrant and repairs there is still the issue of proving the truth of the verbal promise if you go back to the used car dealer and demand the repair only for the dealer to claim that he did not ### what you thought he ###t (happens all the time in situations involving verbal agreements).  You could hypothetically sue in that situation but in reality that would be a difficult case to make even in small claims court.Contact the dealer and see if he will honor his verbal promise.  If not you may be in something of a bind unless the contract's written form supports your side of the argument.Best wishes to you### A. ### ### Esq."43761.7472222222 I purchased a vehicle from a small used car dealership on a Thursday on the following Friday the vehicle stopped working.

While I am not sure if bankruptcy lawyers can do an entire bankruptcy case on a complete pro bono" basis I do think that much of the lawyer's compensation comes at the end when the final settlement goes into effect; this type of structure might help you get to the finish line in this matter.

What the bank told you is correct, and this is why many banks and credit unions will place temporary four-day holds on deposited checks from unverified accounts or unfamiliar financial institutions; in doing so, they are not trying to make life difficult for you, but are actually trying to protect you from this very situation in which you find yourself.  They know that if they allow you access to the deposited funds, or allow you to cash the check without verification beforehand, you are ultimately on the hook for the amount if the check turns out bad.  This does not mean that you cannot report the issuer or the payor of the check for criminal investigation (or sue the ### if you know where ### is situated), but only that on the front end, your bank will hold you liable for the amount it was required to make available to you, but was not verified or made good.  Most banks and credit unions will tell you the same thing, although each bank ### authority to authorize certain limits for immediate availability depends on the ### experience, and also the policies at that particular institution.  Sometimes the manager can override the ### limit by authorizing a higher one, but that does not always happen.  Generally the ### supervisor will override in favor of the bank customer if the customer is someone whom the staff at the bank know and find credible.I am so sorry you were scammed in this way.  I hope you report this to law enforcement so that the ### can be investigated, and if appropriate, prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  Best wishes to you this fall and winter.43770.7916666667 I was involved in an online scam, they sent me a check for $###, it cleared on Tuesday so I withdrew the funds and sent the funds to the people who was supposed to come put an advertising sticker on my car.

Do I have any ground here or should I just pay the money back?43770.7659722222 Thank you for your time and service. So even though the check was clearly dated ###. They are not liable at all right? I did file a police report yesterday and gave the credit union that report number.43770.8194444444 You are very welcome, and again, I regret that this happened to you.  You did the right thing in filing the police report.  I might be wrong, but I do not think the date itself will implicate your bank in any civil liability, since your bank can always argue that they did not see in their system that the check had been cancelled; if that had been the case, the teller would have likely seen this when you walked into the bank to cash or deposit the check.  I admit that I know far less about this situation than you, but absent a clear reason to deny you access to the funds, I doubt that the bank will be liable in any way.  You can always consult in person with a local commercial law attorney if you wish to have a more detailed discussion, but everything I have read from you in these exchanges indicates no civil or criminal liability on the bank's part, and the staff who work there.  Wish I had better news to report, however.43770.8222222222 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thank you for this very important question.  I recommend that you speak about this in person with a debt collection or consumer attorney, for some specific action items to take in the next 24-###, in order to try to preserve your rights to the loan proceeds going through for your real estate closing.  I strongly recommend contacting attorney ### ### of ### at https://######attorney.com/?utm_source=avvo&utm_medium=referral.  She is quite an expert in situations like this, and would have some helpful points to make that might make the difference for you.Also very good is attorney ### ### (see http://www.###law.com/ ), who is one of the most respected consumer attorneys in the North Carolina ### region.  I do not know ### well, but I do know her golden reputation in this area of law, and I do know ### personally, though the ### website.  If you contact ###, tell her that ### ### strongly recommended you to her (you can say the same thing to ###, but she may or may not remember me). While you are contemplating this, I will simply note that the increased debt amount above the minimum $10,### (and attorney's fees as you noted in your post), and also that the creditor MAY accept compromise amounts from you, but is not REQUIRED to do so, especially without a signed Confession of Judgment from you as part of a structured payment plan.The statute of limitations to sue on a debt in North Carolina is three years, unless the contract was signed under notarized seal, in which case it would be ten years; either period ### to run from the date of the debtor's breach of the loan agreement.  So the statute of limitations defense might work, but keep in mind that if they already got a judgment against you (with or without your knowledge or memory of such), all civil judgments are good in NC for ten years, subject to renewal for a second ten years if properly renewed.This is the extent to which I can guide you not being an expert in debt collection or consumer law, but this gives you a start.  My accomplished colleagues, ### ### and ### ###, can take you on from here.  I am ### for you and am hoping that your loan goes through, so that you can achieve your dream of home ownership!Blessings and best wishes to you this winter.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43776.6826388889 I am in the process of purchasing a home and my mortgage ### found a lien that is not on my credit but she got it off of a website they use called Data Verify Report.

Can I file bankruptcy ###?  I am ### ###.  Nobody wants to hire at my age.43782.7590277778 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Based on these facts, Safe Home Security would likely win in any legal dispute about whether this is a legitimate contractual relationship.  Whether you can terminate early and not be liable for the amounts for which you were issued statements depends on the written terms of whatever contract to which you agreed.  Without consulting those provisions, it is impossible to know for sure whether you are liable for the full outstanding amount of monthly installments for the remainder of the five-year period, or whether your liability should end under the contract when you disconnected the alarm and notified the company.  The contract itself will answer those questions for you.As for the mental capacity to contract issue, North Carolina applies what is known as the cognitive test" when deciding whether a party pleading incapacity should be relieved of contract obligations when that party otherwise agreed to be bound by the contract.  What the cognitive test requires is that the party opposite the party pleading ### this case Safe Home ### have to have had sufficient notice by its interactions with you that you were not "in your right mind"; the law imposes no burden on Safe Home Security to be assured completely that you understood what you are doing.  Rather the law presumes that all parties who agree to a contract did so full aware of what they were doing absent fraud duress or mutual mistake.  This legal presumption can be rebutted by the party seeking for the contract to be set aside (in this case you) but in order to be successful that person must show by clear and convincing evidence that (###) the party seeking ### was indeed mentally incompetent as defined by North Carolina law (meaning you did not understand your actions nor the likely foreseeable consequences of such actions); and (###) the party seeking to have the contract enforced had reason to know based on its interactions with the other party that the latter was not of sufficient mental lucidity to ### sign or enter into a contract.  Absent this the contract will stand if Safe Home Security wishes it to be which is what is likely to happen.In light of that analysis I strongly suggest that you locate a copy of the agreement and read it for extra clarity on the status of your position.  Assuming Safe Home Security is not respecting your rights as defined in the agreement it might take a consumer law or commercial attorney sending a ### letter of warning to the company in order to prevent its sending any unpaid sums to ### of course the contract and the law supports your position on this.I hope this helps in terms of general information although I understand that this is not altogether pleasant news.  If you need help from a consumer law attorney consider reaching out to ### ### who is one of the best consumer law attorneys in North Carolina whom I know.  See the link to her firm information below:http://www.###law.com/Blessings and best wishes to you this winter and Thanksgiving.  I sincerely hope that your finances peace of mind and any other concerns will readily improve.  "43788.1201388889 Two years ago I suffered a nervous breakdown. It was during this time that I received an unsolicited phone call from Safe Home Security. The first two times they called I hung up as I normally do when I receive a call from a telemarketer. However, not being of sound mind at he time, I accepted the third call because I thought somebody had set this up for me and had â€œprearrangedâ€ it.  I agreed to a five year contract.  After a two week leave from work to recover, I called Safe Home Security to explain what had happened. I was told I could get out of the contract for a percentage of the remaining balance.  My plan was to use my income tax return to terminate the contract as I cannot afford the monthly payments.  When I called back a few months later, I was told I was not far enough along in the contract to terminate early.  I placed many calls and asked to speak with a supervisor or manager but was given the run around.  I was forced to change my checking account to prevent the payments from being automatically withdrawn.  I have since disconnected the alarm and my home is no longer being monitored.  I have received three statements in the mail and Iâ€™m afraid this will eventually go to collections.  I have an excellent credit score and donâ€™t want this to damage it.  This past February I had to get a second job due to a new water heater expense and $###,###. During this time, I was laid off and was forced to find another job. Luckily, I found employment, however Iâ€™m still barely able to make ends meet.  I simply cannot pay for a home security system when itâ€™s a huge struggle just to make the mortgage payments. I think this was somewhat of a scam and feel taken advantage of; similar to the many elderly people who are targets of deception. Iâ€™m not sure what to do at this point. I didnâ€™t think that reporting them to the Better Business Bureau would help.  Contacting them directly certainly hasnâ€™t gotten me anywhere.  Is there any way to get out of this contract?Thank you for your time. 43788.0902777778 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you so much for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  This ### derelict response to your purchase and inquiries is unfortunate.  I agree with you that a lawyer would not be necessary or appropriate given the low monetary value of the purchase (not to belittle the art itself, of course, or your meaning attached to it).  If the artist does not respond favorably to the certified letter (good move by you), I do not believe there is much you can do besides reporting the artist and his/her business to entities like the Better Business Bureau, the consumer protection division of the state attorney general's office (in whatever state the addresses are located), and online review sites.  You can also report to local law enforcement where the artist lives or maintains the office for the business (although it may be a home office rather than a separate location; you will need to investigate), if you want a criminal charge of fraud to be investigated.  So sorry this happened to you, and I share your concerns.  I agree with you that the principle is important, even when money is not a ### issue.  I hope that you will enjoy a very rewarding ###.

She might be able to assist you from time to time on a consultation basis, which might be more affordable than a long-term retainer (although you should definitely discuss that too, just to see what your payment options might be).  Thanks your blessings, which I fully ###.43795.0993055556 I have been in school for the past ###, struggling to finish a degree, instead, I accumulated debt in credit cards and student loan and was not able to finish school.My question is can I file for bankruptcy by myself without a lawyer? And if so how do I go about it?Please tell me where to find forms and what to do as far as follow ups and things like that. if you cannot, at least tell me where to find the instructions if available somewhere.Thank you so much!43794.7701388889 Hello, again, Mr. ###:I enjoyed answering your previous question this morning, and can answer this one too.  Your concerns about the truck are totally understandable.  The way to address both your and your wife's concerns, not only about the truck, but really all property that you two own together, is to FIRST sign and have notarized a Separation and Property Settlement Agreement.  One of the terms of such an agreement is that, at a certain point specified in the agreement, your wife promises in writing to transfer title sufficient for the DMV's purposes.  This agreement, if done properly, can ensure that you can enforce this promise should the title not get transferred to you based on the timeline.  You can also require in the agreement that your wife not damage or sell the vehicle to anyone else to impair your future interest in the vehicle.This also gives you and your wife the opportunity to work out other arrangements as to your property, instead of having a court decide.  You can have a North Carolina family law attorney draw up the agreement if you plan to be in the state for the near future, but as I said in my previous answer, you would not be able to get a divorce in North Carolina unless one of the spouses has continuously resided in the state for at least six months as of the date of filing for divorce (after one year separation, of course).Glad to interact with you again on your important legal concerns.  Have a blessed weekend and winter.43798.6479166667 I am married but am looking to separate with my wife. Her and I have come to an agreement to do so calmly if that is possible. The issue is my truck is in her name and so is the loan. I have taken out a personal loan to pay off the truck but want to make sure she signs the title over to me once the lean holder sends the title. what is the best way to do this? There is also an extended warranty that is ### one time that I will need her to sign over to me as well. I have the money but don't want to pay the lean holder until I have some sort of document binding her to sign the title over to me once it arrives.   43798.5701388889 ###,Unfortunately, the bankruptcy courts really frown on pro-se (represent yourself) debtors.  It's also an incredibly difficult process to navigate.  Often bankruptcy courts see a very high percentage of pro-se cases dismissed or fail.  Almost all bankruptcy attorneys offer a free consultation, it would certainly be worth your time to at a minimum sit down with someone before trying to take on a filing by yourself.  The courts and bankruptcy administrator also regulate the cost of bankruptcy in North Carolina, so often the cost is very minimal compared to the benefit.  Good luck!### ### ###43810.8270833333 Can you file on behalf of yourself or must you have a attorney do so and pay a one time fee for either way?43808.8534722222 Thank you43813.2388888889 ###,It sounds like you may want to meet with a bankruptcy attorney.  In a Chapter 1###, you can do what is called a cram down" if you purchased the car more than ###.  What happens in a cram down is the secondary loan is stripped off and will become an unsecured debt that is dischargeable.  The first loan can also be reduced.  The first loan can be reduced to the current value of your car with the interest reduced to the Till rate (wall street journal prime rate + ###).  This can be very beneficial if you owe more on your car than what it is worth.  It allows you to only pay the value of your car at ###% (currently) over the next ###-###.  Good luck!### ### ###"43810.8319444444 If you have a loan with a company and they took a second leaning your current car and the credit union holds the original loan when you file for bankruptcy and only include the loan company not the credit union can the loan company still try and take your van? Or are they not allowed?43808.85625 Glad to help ###!Got it. One thing to keep in mind, is that you may have signed a consent judgment as well? If you did, read over it, or send to me. However, it is likely there may just be a judgment against you. It seems likely that the statute of limitations will run and not be renewed. It will still appear on other types of background reports, however, having the SOL run helps your situation greatly. I recommend calling the clerk of court at ### County to inquire once the SOL has run. Ask about their procedure once the SOL has run and the status. Unfortunately it may be difficult to get information over the phone. I also highly recommend refusing to accept the inheritance until the SOL has run. You may communicate, but do not acknowledge guilt or the fact that you owe the money. What state and county is the inheritance coming from? I find it unlikely they will be notified or find out about it. In this situation, I would cover the bases with letting the SOL run, going to the courthouse, etc. and waiting for BOA to make a ### any. I would be happy to speak further should anything arise next month. Call my firm's number at: ### and let them know that you are a pro bono client of ###'s. Good luck and happy holidays!###43819.5993055556 Hello,I had a credit card judgement brought against in ###### initial amount was a $###.They have never attempted to collect the debt other than sending me letters and calling.Is there any chance that once this judgment gets to that ###, that they may not renew the judgement? I understand they very well could, I am just wondering is it more likely than not that they will renew?Is there a process before renewal as far as ### your financial situation to see if you have anything for them to collect on before deciding to renew?I am currently residing in another state, if they did renew would the judgement be transferred here or would it stay in NC? Is this something they would mail to me?The judgement is currently at about $###.Assuming this is renewed is there any hope in settling at this point and how little might they even consider?Thank you for your help!!!!43818.5895833333 Hey ###,To clarify, this was a judgment that was signed by a judge, correct? Not simply starting the process of obtaining a judgement (ie going to court for hearings, etc.)? If no official judgment was entered (ie just starting a court action against you), then the Statute of Limitations is ###. Has there been any activity on the card since the judgment was entered against you? How did this come up after ###? Have you signed anything since the judgment and or made any payments?Assuming this was an official judgment, then the ###. They may not renew so long as none of the above has occurred. The action would stay in NC since it occurred there and they would be required to attempt to serve you even out of state. There is a way to transfer ###, but that is not necessary at this time. How do you know it is up to ###? The judgment should be collecting interest with clerk of court. Credit card companies will always settle. In this situation, and if I took a guess, I imagine they may settle for ###. Let me know if you have any follow up questions. Good luck!###43818.6229166667 Hi ###,Thank you so much for your quick reply!Yes this is an actual court signed official judgement and I have never once acknowledged it. Never made a payment, spoken with anyone or signed anything. Unfortunately as I have had no means to pay it.Since the statute of limitations is ten years I know that is coming up next month. This has been following me around for years as this stems from my very first credit card BOA sent me when I was just ###. I am hoping so much that it isn't renewed. I still receive a letter every now and then, the most recent being within the past year, that is where I recall the ### figure from. I am also worried as I am supposed to receive an inheritance from my grandmother within the next month, it would be just enough to cover that amount, however I am trying to protect that as much as I can if possible.Any idea how quickly they can find out about an inheritance? If this were to be renewed I would have to contact them to hopefully settle, but part of me wants to see if they will possibly just drop it next month which would be ###.The timing just ended up being a little weird with it being almost ###'t know about coming the same time.Thanks again!43818.6583333333 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  I do not think a lawyer can help you with the credit scores if the scores accurately reflect a history of late payments, defaults, hard inquiries, or other negative items that typically lower a credit score, but what could be helpful is having a lawyer negotiate with your hospital or medical provider to see if a payment plan or reduced amount can be worked out in writing.  You do not necessarily need a lawyer for that, but you might get better repayment terms if you have a lawyer who is then in contact with the hospital's lawyer or claims manager.  You will probably still have to end up paying at least ### 70% of the debt, but maybe not 100%.  It is up to the hospital as to how flexible they wish to be in ### the right to sue for or privately demand what is owed them, and to what extent.I see nothing illegal or improper as to the credit scores.  If you owe that much debt and you are in default, that will lower your credit score dramatically.  There is nothing unusual or improper about that.I am glad that you are almost finished, however, with your nursing studies; I commend you and congratulate you on this very worthwhile accomplishment, especially as the son of a single mother who went back to school later in life to become an RN.  I have much respect for what you have accomplished, and what nurses do every day in hospitals across the country.  May your new credential soon put you on the productive path to gainful employment and financial ### you no doubt deserve.God bless you this holiday, and in ###.43818.8076388889 I am currently in a nursing in ###, NC.

They claim that these medical bills will be eventually paid by medicare but it could take a year or so before the bills are paid. However the problem now is that this firm can't handle cases in NC for some reason now. That's why I am searching for a NC firm that handles the same thing. Thank You43818.9715277778 Thank you so much!43819.5069444444 You are so welcome!  I hope something can be done for your peace of mind.43819.7083333333 Good Saturday evening to you, Mr. Goodman:Thank you for your question.  First, I think you should know that you can file a Motion for Extension of Time with the Clerk of Court for an additional ###, AS LONG AS you do so within the first initial ###.  You would need to file the motion with the Clerk, and serve by mail or hand-delivery a ### copy of your Motion and Order to Extend Time, along with a Certificate of Service identifying the persons to receive the motion and order (the opposing lawyer, or the party itself if it has no lawyer, which it should if it is an incorporated lender), and the method of service being used (i.e., hand delivery, first-class mail or certified mail), pursuant to Rule ###.  In order to save you valuable time and headache, ask your personal injury lawyer for a template of (1) a Motion to Extend Time, (2) a Proposed Order, and (3) a Certificate of Service.  Every legal paper filed with the court needs to be served on the same day upon the opposing party as described above, with the same Certificate of Service identifying the paper being served, the party who is getting it, and the method being used.As to the Complaint itself, you will notice that each allegation has enumerated paragraphs accompanying them; for your Answer, you use the same style and format used in the Complaint (including the heading at the top of the first place), except that in the Answer you write, Admitted" if all information in the allegation paragraph in the complaint is true; "Denied" if all information is not true; or partially admit or deny depending on what information in the complaint is accurate and which is not with your more definite description of each.  You might also ask your personal injury lawyer if he can offer some brief feedback on whether you have any grounds on which to move to dismiss under any of the reasons enumerated under Rule 12(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.  I do not think it would take your lawyer long to take a quick look at the complaint and offer this feedback and he should already have templates of the motion order and certificate of service I previously mentioned.  He can probably give you at least enough feedback to ### respond to the Complaint.After your ### to Dismiss Answer Counterclaim or combination of one or more of ### will likely be a hearing if a motion to dismiss is made and if the complaint and answer are more or less the same in allegations the lender may make a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings under Rule 12(c) which would hand the court judgment for the amount alleged.  If the lawsuit survives the initial pleading stages this case is likely to proceed to mediation if in Superior Court (where the negotiations for a settlement will be undergone) or arbitration in District Court (the arbitrator's decision can be appealed but if not it is final whichever way the arbitrator rules).This will be a very difficult case to effectively litigate without a lawyer and the chances are high that one way or the other the lender will end up with a judgment or confession of judgment before the case is over.  Finding counsel to do a case like this for free is almost impossible but I am hoping that your personal injury lawyer on the other related matter can at least look at what you were served with and offer a few helpful points about how to proceed.  If the lender can prove that it is actually owed the money it complains of in its pleading a victory of some kind on its side is very likely.  If there is a settlement negotiation in mediation hopefully you can achieve some sort of compromise that allows you to make payments in installments while you get your cash situation together and avoid having a confession of judgement docketed against you assuming you are willing to sign one as part of the settlement negotiations.That is about all we can offer you in a limited online forum such as this one but at least it gives you an idea of what lay next.  I hope for a ### that will allow you to manage your liability exposure and shore up your finances for both the short-term and long-term.

How much is the debt for at this point? Is this the first action against you in regards to this debt? Often times, credit card companies (and their attorneys) will accept payment plans to pay over time. Credit card debt is unsecured debt, so they cannot put a lien against your house or other belongings. The process: open action against you, serve you, hold a hearing in superior court to get a judgement against you. Do you have a hearing yet? You still have time to negotiate a payment plan or you can counter with an amount you can pay. They usually will accept ###% of the full debt. Let me now what questions you may have.

Should I let the attorneys for the debtor know my situation that there is nothing I can do?43840.6784722222 Good afternoon, Ms ###:Thank you for your question.  The statute of limitations for ordinary debts and breaches of contract is three years in North Carolina, under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###-5###(###), so if this is a threat to sue based on a default by you that occurred in ###009, it is way too late to pursue this debt, UNLESS you signed the loan agreement under notarized seal.  If you did, there is a ten-year statute of limitations under Â§ ###-47(###), but even that would be a foreclosed opportunity for the lender since we are in ###0###0.Yes, I think you are right that they are likely just trying to stretch and see if they can make the most of an old debt.  If these reported harassing calls continue, I counsel at least two options: (###) file a complaint against the company with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and/or (###) hire a consumer advocacy lawyer to send the company a ### worded cease and desist" letter to comply with federal and state debt collection laws.  If you choose option (###) I think a lawyer can do this for you for only a couple hundred dollars.  You would want to seek out a contracts commercial or consumer lawyer.  While she is not in ### County I can strongly recommend ### ### in Orange County with whom you could work over phone for her to represent you if desired.

I think you are on the right side of the law, and now it is merely a matter of making sure the lender understands this (or, I should say, that it understands that YOU understand this, as I am sure the lender knew this already and was simply trying to bully you in the hopes that you did not know your own rights, or that you would not consult with a lawyer).

How annoying.Have a great day and thanks again for you help.###"43840.7625 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  The first thing you need to understand is that this is far more than a court appearance; the plaintiff has sued you, and if you do not have an Answer, Motion to Dismiss or combination of both (depending on what the complaint says), American Express is going to seek a default judgment against you after filing an entry of default, and then you will have a judgment on your record that might linger for ten years (unless you pay it in that time; otherwise, it can be renewed for a second ten-year interval).  This is not your simply showing up in court and making a plea for fairness.Also, you cannot simply offer a payment plan to make the lawsuit go away--or, at least not initially.  Should this lawsuit be referred to either mediation or arbitration, you will have the chance to offer a compromise to bring about an early end to this lawsuit, but it will cost you.  Normally, plaintiff lenders will not accept a compromise during a negotiation unless you offer them the following three things: (###) some money upfront (to be negotiated); (###) an acceptable payment installment arrangement (as you indicated you would like to do already); and (###) a confession of judgment, which operates the same as an actual court judgment, except that it is held in trust while you are in repayment compliance.  If you make good on your payment plan, the confession of judgment will never be docketed with the Orange County Clerk of Court, nor executed by the Orange County Sheriff against your assets.  If you later default on the repayment plan, however, American Express will be empowered to levy against assets, not by having to file a new lawsuit all over again, but this time, by docketing the judgment.Whether a court judgment is eventually entered against you, or a confession of judgment, the collections process is essentially the same: before the Sheriff can execute, a deputy will serve upon you a copy of the judgment, and a Notice to Claim Exempt Property."  You would have twenty (###0) days to fill out and return the Notice which would allow you to claim as exempt up to $###### as well as your clothing furniture and other personal items (up to $TERM00133###).  You could also claim other property including pensions ###0###K plans and equity in your home (up to an amount) pursuant to N.C.G.S. Chapter ###C.So at this point your two main options in the immediate context are to (###) defend against the suit and try to reach a compromise early on that puts a stop to this or (###) declare bankruptcy which would stop all state court proceedings while the bankruptcy is in progress and might result in the end of the state court collections lawsuit altogether.If you choose option (###) consult with a bankruptcy lawyer in the ### area as soon as possible.  If option (###) is the more desirable or workable solution you need to prepare an Answer that mirrors the enumerated-paragraph format of the Complaint with your own statements as to whether the allegations in the corresponding paragraphs are (###) Admitted (###) Denied or (###) Admitted in part and Denied in part.  If you admit and deny parts of the allegation paragraph at issue you need to specify which of the plaintiff's stated facts you are admitting and which you are denying.  In your ### for relief clause you should indicate what you would like for the court to do (just as the plaintiff did in the corresponding section at the end of the Complaint).If you have a little money for a consultation fee it would not hurt for you to consult with a civil litigation lawyer in order to help you better understand the forecast of the lawsuit including discovery should the plaintiff send interrogatories requests for admissions or request for production of documents to you.  A 90-minute consultation would probably cost around $###50 (maybe more or less depending on the lawyer) and that would give you a chance to talk through the details and ask follow-up questions about what to expect.  It will also take some of the pressure off you in terms of knowing how to draft an appropriate response (which you would need to file and serve in accordance with Rule ###).You have thirty (###0) days in state court to reply by filing and serving a response unless you within the first thirty (###0) days from being served file a Motion to Extend Time which is automatically granted and will extend you another thirty (###0) days to prepare your response.  The Motion would need to be filed with the Clerk and served on the opposing party's lawyer--either by hand delivery or by first-class mail again pursuant to Rule 5 with a one-page Certificate of Service which details the paper being served the method of service employed the person to whom it is sent and who is sending it.  Both the Motion would need to be on file with the Clerk and mailed or delivered so be prepared to always bring at least four (###) originals of these and any filing you make.  Every filing must be accompanied with a Certificate of Service under Rule 5.Hope this gives you a good start.  I wish you the best in this matter and in ###0###0.  Blessings and be well."43843.9826388889 I am being sued for an outstanding debt of $### by American Express. I donâ€™t dispute that I owe this sum, but have asked for and would like to make monthly payments in a way that I can afford to pay the balance. Can you please give me some guidance for my court appearance on how to come to this resolution? What should I expect and what are my options?Thank you,### ###43843.7555555556 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for this important question.  It is possible that you have legal rights to the ring back under the old common law claim known as breach of the promise to marry."  This goes back to the early ### in this state (and other jurisdictions based on English common law principles).  Essentially the outlines of the claim are this: two parties agree to marry and as part of the consideration in supporting that agreement one party buys the other an engagement ring or some other valuable item only for the other party to back out of the agreement to marry.  If this happened you likely have a right to get the ring back (as well as any other valuable gifts given SPECIFICALLY AS CONSIDERATION FOR THE INTENDED ### as opposed to mere gifts before the engagement) and to sue for the value of such things if your former fiance does not accede to your reasonable demands.However there are a couple ### points to keep in mind just in case one of them might be relevant (I know you did not mention these but just want you to be on general notice to be safe):First the agreement to marry must have been made in the state of North Carolina in order to be legally effective.Second if your fiance left the agreement to marry because of ### concerns about sexually transmitted or other serious diseases that could effect your intimacy or health as a married couple she will not be liable to you for breach of the contract to marry.Third if either you or your finance was married to another person at the time of your contract to marry the contract cannot be enforced.With these thoughts in mind you might consider retaining a family law attorney or civil litigation attorney to send the former fiance a legal demand letter warning her to return the ring and/or any other valuable gifts in consideration of marriage or else face the prospect of being sued.  But keep in mind that in order for the demand letter to have any teeth to it you have to be prepared to follow through with your litigation threat just in case the threat is not heeded.This gives you an idea of what the issues are in a general sense.  I am sure you will gain additional clearer insights once you actually have the benefit of a lawyer working directly with you on this matter.Consider ### "Find a Lawyer" search feature or the Buncombe County Bar Association for potential referrals.Have a blessed and rewarding ###."43843.9944444444 I couldnâ€™t explain it all in ###. Just want the ring back. She took everything else.Sheâ€™s vindictive and I donâ€™t know why43843.8479166667 Hey ###,In short yes. Who is the creditor and who is the law firm? How far past due is the debt. They are always willing to settle, so it would be worthwhile to call and have the law firm extend an offer to the creditor. Good luck and let me know if you have further questions. ###43845.8493055556 I ran into hard times a little over a year ago and had to quit paying a couple bills. Iâ€™m trying to save up enough money to take care of them. I got a letter in the mail from what looks like a lawyer saying that if I donâ€™t take care of my debt with the company who hired them within ###, that they will file a law suit.

I recommend that you report this to your local police and your local Better Business Bureau.  You may also want to speak to a bankruptcy attorney about your options with regard to the debt.  Many of us do not charge for an initial consultation, or charge a modest fee.  Good luck to you.43847.6361111111 Thank you.   I obviously do not have any money for a consult my income is below the poverty level.  I do appreciate your help  on top of that my ex husband stopped paying his alimony .   Everything crashed at one time.   I think I need to be an attorney.      Thank you43856.7041666667 Due to a job loss I have accrued a lot of debt. I went to mediation for a credit card ###.

I canâ€™t afford an attorney and still donâ€™t have the means to pay the credit card company. My question is what options if any do I have?43847.6743055556 Good evening, Ms. Matthews:Thank you for your question.  At this point, if the lawsuit has been filed, you have no choice but to defend against the lawsuit.  This would consist of filing an Answer, Motion to Dismiss, or combination of both, before the end of your thirty (30)-day deadline.  You can obtain an extra thirty (30) days to respond if you file a Motion to Extend time within the first thirty (30) days from the date you were served with the Complaint and Summons.  The motion would need to be filed and served upon the plaintiff by either first-class mail or personal delivery, pursuant to Rule ###.In the Answer, you would essentially answer each paragraph allegation in the Complaint, using the same stylistic format as the Complaint for your response.  In each of your corresponding allegation paragraphs, you would Admit Deny or partially admit and deny, and indicate which specific parts of the paragraph you are admitting, and which ones denying.  Your Prayer for Relief clause at the very end, just before your signature space and contact information, should stylistically resemble the format of the plaintiff's Prayer for Relief Clause in the Complaint, but should specifically ask for the court to deny the plaintiff's requested relief, as well as affirmatively state what your requests of the court are in terms of relief.Read the NC Rules of Civil Procedure carefully at this link, https://www.ncleg.gov/Laws/GeneralStatuteSections/Chapter1A , especially Rules ### ### (Rules ### ###, if this suit lasts long enough to include discovery requests, such as interrogatories, requests for admissions, requests for production of documents, depositions, etc.).  See if there are any grounds for making a Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b), and also whether there are any affirmative defenses that apply to your situation under Rule 8(c), which might bar the plaintiff's claims against you (one good example being statute of limitations, although there is a three-year statute of limitations for money/debt owed, and breach of contract in most situations).Once you finish preparing whatever response you draft, you need to print at least four (4) originals of the finished product, then do the following: first, have the Clerk's office at the courthouse time-stamp every original, and leave one with the Clerk's office for the permanent courthouse file; second, mail or hand deliver one stamped original to the opposing side's attorney; and third, retain the remaining two (2) originals for your own files.  You need to do the same thing with the other document--the Certificate of Service--which should be a one-page document that states your name and party status (defendant), the document you are serving on the opposing party, the method of service you are using under Rule 5 (first-class mail or hand delivery), and the name and address of the party to whom you are serving.  The document should be dated, with your signature, name, mailing address, phone number (and fax if you have one), and email address, at flush right at the end of the brief document.If this is a Superior Court case, you will likely be called to mediation through the in-court mediation process, and if you cannot come up with the funds by which to propose a settlement for a smaller amount than what is owed, the mediation will likely end quickly unless you can offer a payment plan with some money upfront, with the rest in installments over a very brief period of time (most likely in six months at max).  If the lender accepts this, it would likely also demand a Confession of Judgment which it would hold in trust while you are in repayment compliance.  Should you default on the payment plan, the lender would then file and docket the Confession of Judgment with the Clerk of Superior Court, then proceed to execute the instrument against your assets after providing you a Notice to Claim Exempt Property" under N.C.G.S. Chapter 1C which you would need to answer and return in twenty (20) days.  Claiming exempt property in a timely manner under the Notice would protect $3###'s Bluebook value and your household furniture/effects as well as your valuable books instruments etc. relating to your occupation/profession and also some threshold of equity in your home if you own one (check N.C.G.S. Chapter 1C for more precise confirmation).The chances of your getting a judgment entered a judgment against you are high if any of the following happens: (1) you default by not answering the Complaint and Summons within thirty (30) days (or longer if you get an extension); (2) you cannot come up with enough money to settle and achieve a compromise during mediation discussions or through settlement negotiations at any time during the lawsuit; (3) the opposing party moves for either Judgment on the Pleadings (Rule 12(c) ) or Summary Judgment (Rule 56); or (4) you offer a Confession of Judgment but then default on the payment plan.  If any of these four (4) procedural events occurs the judgment will be entered and be good for ten (10) years subject to renewal for an additional ten years.  This will ruin your credit within a month of judgment being entered so try to avoid a judgment being entered and docketed against you if at all possible.  If it happens anyway pay it off as soon as possible.This gives you a general overview of what is likely to come.  God bless you with renewed prosperity and financial resources in 2020 so you can rebound take care of yourself and your needs and enjoy life in greater abundance.  May your deliverance come soon.Blessings this new year."43848.1347222222 If I got a civil judgment from nine years ago from a car I couldn't afford and wrecked could what owed on civil judgment be taken from my personal injury settlement check I am getting in a week43847.6923611111 It is possible.  Unlikely but possible.  A judgment creditor is supposed to send you this paperwork -- https://www.nccourts.gov/documents/forms/notice-of-right-to-have-exemptions-designated -- and give you ###, before attempting to collect on a judgment.  It is very important to respond timely and appropriately; most people need the help of an attorney to respond.  If you follow this procedure correctly, you should be able to protect the settlement funds, but if you ###, they are at risk.  I recommend that you talk to a local bankruptcy attorney about your particular situation, because the settlement funds should be protected in bankruptcy and it would help you put this judgment behind you.I hope this helps.  Good luck.43847.7395833333 ###, I am sorry that you are in this situation.Based upon the information you've given me, you and your friend have a binding legal contract. You have legal remedies available to you once your friend breaches the contract. As of right now, your friend has not breached the contract because the money is not yet due. However, if your friend does not repay you by ###, he will have breached the contract. Once your friend actually breaches the contract, you will be able to file a small claims case. You will need to file your lawsuit in the county where your friend resides. I have attached a guide to how Small Claims Court operates in North Carolina. I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to resolve this matter. 43852.7166666667 I recently loaned a friend" $250 due to be paid back in full on (or by without penalty) ###. $###.### (using my Adobe Sign subscription so it's secure/valid).Unfortunately before I had a chance to send him a revised agreement for the full/final amount I discovered that he had blocked me on his cell phone.

Thank you in advance."43852.3972222222 Good evening, Ms. Pascual:Thank you for your question.  I will try to make a few general points and see if this covers everything that concerns you, as there are a few issues going on in this situation at the same time.  Please see the following, and send me a reply if I have missed anything you believe important to discuss.As far as the DMV is concerned, the vehicle is not yours until the private seller (as opposed to a car dealership, which would do this differently), signs over to you an MVR form under notarized seal.  Until or unless that happens, you are not the owner" of the vehicle although you may have certain rights to claim the vehicle or a refund depending on whether your purchase agreement with the seller was in writing.  If there was a written ### of sale consult that document to see what your remedies might be.  If no ### of sale exists in writing you need to decide whether you wish to seek the vehicle title to be transferred over to you or whether to demand a refund of the contract price of the vehicle.The seller can stick by his argument that you can have the car by simply picking it up but if he insists on that he must transfer the title on the proper DMV form.  If he does not deliver the title to you by signing it over and having it notarized you would be entitled to your refund as you indicated to him that you desired.Whether the vehicle has a warranty depends squarely on what the owner said (or wrote if there was a written contract) about the vehicle's quality.  Unless the seller specifically indicated that all parts of the vehicle are in good working order the legal presumption will likely be that he sold it to you "as is."  If he specifically warranted quality as to any part of the vehicle (motor radiator air conditioning/heat etc.) then you could enforce those assurances against the seller even if they were made verbally.  A lawyer would need to know a lot more about the discussions and negotiations leading up to the sale to know what assurances to you have the force of law and which do not.It appears to me that the essence of this situation is whether you are going to get the DMV title form and if you do not timely get it whether you intend to sue for the title to be transferred under the legal theory of "specific performance or whether you intend to sue for the $###.###.  Warranties might be a part of this situation, but I cannot say for sure without knowing the situation in the detail that a lawyer retained by you would be.Two takeaways here: first, be sure your agreements to purchase vehicles are reduced to a ### ### of sale; and second, when paying a relatively small amount of money for a vehicle, be sure that you do not tender payment until/unless you get a ### and notarized DMV MVR form--at least in cases involving private, individual sellers, since dealerships will take care of this step for you without need of an MVR form.If you need more specific guidance, you could consult with a contracts, commercial or consumer law attorney, but a consultation fee for more than an hour would likely exceed the sum you paid for the vehicle.Feel free to reply within the next 24-###.  Best wishes to you in ###.43856.0006944444 I payed for a car to a guy i used to work with.

What can we do to legally to get compensated for money they owe us?43857.6736111111 I am so sorry you are going through this.  Unfortunately, I do not have very good news.  I assume you filed a Notice of Rights with a Motion to Set Aside Exempt Property and allowed the ###.  You have to do this before you file a Writ of Execution.

While this might depend on your contract with the lease company, I would think that true normal wear and tear" would not be something for which you are responsible.

Break down caused me a month revenue. I limped the truck back home now they want me to pay for everything when it is a preexisting problem, two technicitions told me.43858.9868055556 Thanks43859.0215277778 Hello ###,I don't have any tips for locating a bank account unfortunately. If you paid for his future services with a check you could potentially see if he deposited that check into a bank account by looking at the check stub with your bank or asking if your bank had any ability to trace where the check was deposited. More simply to find his bank accounts you could pursue post-judgment asset discovery in the form of written interrogatories to Mr. Diodato asking him to identify any bank accounts that he has. If he refused to answer these questions you could have him required to come before the court and held in contempt for any continued refusal to answer your interrogatories. As far as your concern about him lying under oath, there is really nothing to be done about that except to remind him of the severe penalties for perjury.If he didn't deposit the funds, or you paid with cash, you will have a hard time recovering those funds unless there is cash lying around when the sheriff executes on the judgment for the sheriff to sieze, which is of course unlikely. Moving on to your question about the upfront deposit when forcing the sale of real property or a vehicle, I have to be honest I'm not sure where that particular requirement was drawn from. Having reviewed the judgement execution statutes for NC I did not see any requirement that a judgment-creditor post a non-refundable bond when having the sheriff sell a debtor's vehicle or real property. That may simply be an old requirement or the attorney who wrote that blog-post originally may have simply been mistaken. I've attached a hyperlink to the NC execution statute from where I've drawn that conclusion below for your easy reference and future use.https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_1/Article_28.pdf43871.5444444444 Hello ###,The way I understand your question, you're concerned that even if you are successful in the lawsuit you're thinking about filing against Mr. Diodato, you won't be able to satisfy any judgment you receive against him. First, if you are successful in bringing a lawsuit against Mr. Diodato is his individual capacity you will receive what is called a judgment" in your favor presumably based on what you've explained above in some amount of money. That judgment assuming Mr. Diodato doesn't immediately write you a check which you seem doubtful of will then have to be "executed" on. I've included a well written and comprehensive if high level overview of the process below that I found online while researching this for you that will help you better understand the process. Also there is always a chance that Mr. Diodato might just pay the judgment immediately because as you noted outstanding judgments have negative effects on credit reports getting loans and various other aspects of day-to-day life. If you have obtained a judgment against an individual he/she has the right to have certain property set aside as being â€œexemptâ€ from execution. This means that you cannot take those assets to satisfy your judgment. Once thirty (30) days from the entry of your judgment have passed and prior to execution efforts you must send an individual judgment debtor two forms: (###) a â€œNotice of Rights to Have Exemptions Designatedâ€ and (###) a Motion to Claim Exempt Property. These forms can be obtained on the North Carolina Court Systemâ€™s website. Beware: these forms must be served in accordance with the North Carolina General Statutes and if not done appropriately can set you back in the time it takes to execute on your judgment.Once served the judgment debtor must complete and file the forms with the Court within twenty (###0) days of receiving the documents. Failure to do so will result in any potential exemptions being waived. If the judgment debtor completes and files the forms within the time period allowed the judgment creditor can file objections to the exemptions within ten (###0) days.After the period of claiming exemptions has expired and any objections have been resolved the judgment creditor may request a Writ of Execution to the Clerk of Court for issuance of an Order for Execution. A writ may be issued in any county where the judgment has been recorded and is valid for ninety (###) days. Once the Order is issued the Sheriff must take steps to locate property owned by the judgment debtor. It is always helpful to provide as much information as possible to the Sheriff to help aid in collecting on your judgment (such as bank account numbers banking institutions real property vehicles or other personal property of the judgment debtor) Informal property searches such as county tax records the county register of deeds the DMV and social media may prove helpful in locating asset information of the judgment debtor.Unless it is claimed as exempt many different types of items or property may be sold or levied on to satisfy your judgment. This includes but is not limited to any goods (vehicles tools personal property etc.) real property and bank accounts belonging to the judgment debtor. Be aware that selling real property or vehicles often takes time and requires an up-front deposit by the judgment creditor that may not be recouped from the judgment debtor. If real property has a mortgage on it or is otherwise encumbered by a lien the funds from the sale will be distributed according to priority â€“ whoever had the encumbrance first will get paid first. Secured lienholders (such as the lender) will get paid first when a vehicle is sold and remaining money if any will go to the judgment creditor up to the judgment amount. North Carolina does not permit wage garnishment except in very limited situations such as past due child support. In addition the Sheriff is entitled to receive a percentage of the sale proceeds as a fee.If you and/or the Sheriff are unsuccessful in fully satisfying your judgment during the ### donâ€™t worry! Your judgment is good for ten (###0) years and may be extended for an additional ten (###0) years. After the first unsuccessful Writ of Execution other actions may be taken such as sending written questions or asking the Court to order that the judgment debtor appear and testify under oath regarding their assets.It should be noted that you can file your case in Small Claims Court in which case you can represent yourself pro se and without an attorney if the amount in controversy is less than the limit set in your specific county. The limits vary by county from $5### $###00 so you will have to check. The filing fee is $###. I've attached the complaint form that you would need to file in small claims court for this claim."43869.7819444444 I am aiming to file a civil lawsuit against a contractor who failed to perform services after payment.  I have many emails, text messages..adequate evidence to prove the case in front of a judge.  The thing I'm concerned about is the ability to get the money back after successful judgement.  I do not know if the person owns a home or car, has any money in the bank, etc.  I've read online articles about this, basically mentioning the only thing that could be affected, the only punishment, would be a bad ### on his credit report.  I could use help knowing steps I can take to ensure my success so I do not waste time and money on a situation that I will have little luck with.  43867.6888888889 Thank you so much for being helpful!I am afraid that the fellow is a bit of a low life that doesn't own any significant property, nor intends to.  Of course I'm learning this after hiring him.  It has come up that he is an alcoholic, and is content spending his energy sitting around a mobile home not owned by himself.  Looking at DMV records might be helpful though.  He probably has some kind of vehicle, but that is likely to be exempted.  Would you have any tips for locating a bank account?  It seems like waiting the ###, but he very well could have nothing.  And he may have no problem lying under oath too.  I honestly suspect that he may not pay taxes or have much record about what he does.  I apologize.  can you explain this comment for me?

When you filled out the forms to open your mom's estate, you let the court know about all of your mother's assets. The debt collector knows what your mother's assets are. Did you list the 401k as one of her assets on the form? Were you your mom's beneficiary as far as the 401k is concerned?I can better advise you once I know these questions. Thank you!43873.7284722222 I'm so sorry to hear that. I will say that it is not unusual for debt collectors to come collect from an estate several months after the estate is opened. I cannot answer when they had the information in their system. I believe your best route is to call the NC Bar Association Lawyer Referral Service to consult with an estate attorney and to have someone negotiate the debt on your behalf.I wish you the very best of luck! 43874.8395833333 My mother passed away on ###. I found out she had a checking account and a 401K plan but she never left a beneficiary or had a will. I was told that I would have to file a estate to access these things. I was my mother's only surviving heir. I filed a small estate and I had the checking account closed and I collected the small remaining funds. I am still currently in the process of trying to get the 401K funds. Recently I received papers in the mail from a debt collector who I had no clue how they got my information stating that the estate of my late mother which is me owes them $###,###. I was not aware of this debt at all and this comes months later after my mother's death. These collectors was asking me if my mother had any assets and me being so confused as well as scared said she had a checking account but I had already collected those funds and I was still working on the 401K. They even tried to tell me they are willing to settle if I pay at least $###. I was even asked about if she had any stocks and bonds as well as a car and house which my mother had none of those things. There is no way I can afford to pay any hospital bills even with any remaining funds I have left over as well as from the amount of the ### because it's very very small compared to the amount of .money they are asking for. I feel that it's not fair that they are trying to harass me for a debt I was never aware or responsible for and is trying to get my small funds from me or any kind of money at all even though my mother is no longer here. Is there anything that can be done about this matter?43873.6465277778 Thank you for your quick response! Unfortunately, because your mother did not leave a beneficiary for her 401k, I believe the 401k becomes part of her estate.However, I believe an estate attorney would be better suited to help you navigate this because they can review your mom's estate file to confirm this. From there, you can decide if you have to negotiate with the hospital or not. You may call the NC Bar Association Lawyer Referral Service to schedule a low-cost consultation with a North Carolina attorney. If you do call this number to set up an appointment, I would have the date you opened up your mom's estate, proof that you published that your mom's estate was opened in the newspaper, and the date that you heard from the creditor. This will help that lawyer as he reviews your mom's file.This number would also be good to use if you decide you'd like an attorney to reach a settlement with the creditor if you have to. I hope everything works out!43873.8111111111 When I filed for a small estate, I just filed and that's it. I never had anything published in the newspaper. Another thing I want to add is when I was talking to a customer service person on the phone, they stated that they have had that file as far as my mother's information in their system since ### which was the actual day my mother died. How is it possible for them to already have a file for debt on the actual day she died but yet months later send out papers saying I owe them money for hospital bills? I can understand if when my mother passed away she actually died at the hospital when it occured, thus accumulating hospital bills but see, when my mother died, she was not even at the hospital because me and the rest of my family actually found her dead at her home when we had to call the police and ask for a welfare check on my mother since she was not answering her door or her phone in which the police had to actually break into her house to find out the reason why she was not answering her phone and door. 43874.1076388889 Yes I listed the 401K as one of her assets because I learned from my aunt, my mother's sister, that my mother had a 401K and my mother never even told me about it which is why I filed a small estate to get access. I found out before I filed that my mother never listed anyone as a beneficiary on the 401K including me.43873.7583333333 I purchased weight lifting supplements from FitKing in ###, through eBay. Have been for years. The product, MusclePharm Assault. When my purchase arrived, it was all chunky and nasty. The sticker on the bottom said best by ### but it was clearly expired. I contacted the manufacturer, MusclePharm and they said they do not put Best By stickers but stamp the lot number and the expiration date on the bottom of the container. This FitKing company is washing out the expiration date from MusclePharm and re-selling expired products with their own Best By stickers. This seems dangerous and because I've been buying from them for while, I'm concerned for my health. They move thousands of products every day and I wonder how much of it is expired products with fake expiration dates. I'd like to sue them but live in Wisconsin. Is there any pro bono lawyers who work for a portion of the judgement or settlement?43874.6722222222 You could consider any or all of the following:(###) Filing a consumer complaint with the NC Attorney General's Office:  https://ncdoj.gov/file-a-complaint/(###) Contacting a personal injury attorney in the ### area.  While these attorneys generally do not handle PI cases pro bono, and this is not exactly an injury case, there may be a plaintiff's attorney interested in taking this on on a contingency basis, meaning the attorney isn't paid unless there is a recovery.  (###) Contacting the NC Bar Association's Lawyer Referral Service to be matched with an attorney for a $###:  https://www.ncbar.org/public-resources/lawyer-referral-service/Good luck.43874.6798611111 Good evening, Professor ###:Thanks for your post.  You have asked a lot of questions here, so instead of the formal, paragraph format I typically use in my responses, I will address each question by one or a few sentences, ###.  After reading your fact summary and attachments, I find this to be a very straightforward matter that I have seen repeatedly in six years of litigating cases for both creditors and debtors.  Please see the following brief replies.The Confession of Judgment" (referred to in this situation as a "Statement Authorizing Entry of Judgment") is valid and enforceable if you sign it and yes you have the correct understanding that it is not filed and docketed with the Clerk nor served by the Sheriff unless you default on the underlying agreement giving rise to the Authorization and do not cure it within the ten (10) days the creditor is allowing you through its counsel.While you might want to research the disability question on SSA's website (or another government website related to social safety net programs including disability) to be sure I doubt this will agreement and Authorization will jeopardize eligibility for disability--mainly because this is not providing you income but is actually lessening your income due to the repayment schedule.  However while I am deeply versed in debtor-creditor lawsuits I fully ### here that I am not a disability lawyer and my word on this particular question should not be the final word insofar as you are concerned.  With all other things I might add here I can speak with much more authority.This does not affect your ability to move; the terms are binding on you regardless of whether you move.  If you default and move to another state the creditor can still find you and initiate the collection/execution of judgment process.I see no reason why this would prevent you from filing for bankruptcy should that step be subsequently needed.Both parties are equally bound to whatever agreement both parties sign.The purpose of the verification is for you to provide a sworn statement--i.e. under oath--to "verify" that the statements in the Authorization are in fact correct and not contested by you.  This will be necessary for the creditor to confirm in a sworn writing in case you later default and the Authorization needs to be filed with the court.Once the settlement agreement ending the lawsuit has been signed by both parties neither party may unilaterally change terms of agreement.  The parties may subsequently change terms by a signed written modification that is supported by consideration but that modification MUST be mutual.  No party may unilaterally impose a modification.Interest is usually capped at eight percent (8%) under North Carolina usury statute N.C.G.S. Â§ 24-1; however when the creditor is a "National Association" ("N.A.") federal banking rules supersede state ones and the interest may be substantially higher under the constitutional "preemption" doctrine.  This could be anywhere from eight percent (8%) to 24% or higher but this gives room for both sides to negotiate what is a fair interest rate on outstanding debt.  Also note that under law (without need of negotiation in the form of a contract) the creditor can be reimbursed by the debtor for collection/court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.  Because that is automatically the rule under statute you may or may not see such language in the actual settlement contract.  Just be aware that this is out there and is legal subject to the judge's discretion.The main advantage to entering into this proposed deal is that it stops the state court litigation proceeding against you and gives you a chance not to have a judgement entered against you at least as long as you are in compliance with the agreement's terms.  Otherwise you will likely lose the lawsuit and have a judgment immediately effective against you.  Based on what I have seen in the past in similar lawsuits the terms proposed in the lawyer's letter to you appear to be by all accounts fair and reasonable.  I do not see anything that signals a red flag from a lawyer's point of view.  However when you get the actual settlement contract to sign (and of course I have not seen such a document here but merely the lawyer's letter ### to the key points) you need to read it carefully for final definitive clarity.  Otherwise if the contract resembles the proposed terms from the letter this appears to be a good deal for you.Exempt property under N.C.G.S. Chapter ### will protect up to $###### as well as $###### and other property necessary for basic standards of living (google the statute in order to see the full listing; the items will appear in the "Notice to Claim Exempt Property which is fairly easy and straightforward to fill out).  Anything not exempt, or timely claimed as exempt within the allotted ###, can and likely will be seized by the Sheriff.I hope this is helpful.  Thank you for all your hard work in the ### Department of English.  Under Chancellors Bardo, Belcher and Brown, you have helped make the Catamount family more ### and enlightened.43876.0402777778 Legal Aid said they could not help me with this but they will help me fill out the papers to claim exempt property after there is a judgment. They cannot tell me anything about applying for disability until after I apply on my own and my application is rejected. So they are not a resource for understanding options and making decisions about what direction to go in in the first place.I read that even if the sheriff's office asks for payment, after a judgment, I don't have to pay if I barely have money for food/medical expenses, but I also read that it's possible to lose your driver's license if court judgments aren't paid. I don't know if these things are true. I would be physically trapped and unable to work without a license.43876.0145833333 Someone at the collection law firm representing a credit card suing me has sent me a STATEMENT AUTHORIZING ENTRY OF JUDGEMENT" and  "VERIFICATION" acknowledging the due execution of the statement. The cover letter says that if I pay $### and sign the forms they will drop the current law suit against me. (I received a summons and answered the Complaint with an Answer but no court date has been set.) The letter does state a Feb. ### but the letter was mailed Feb. 10. I think my best plan right now would be to pay $### consistently and then this document would never be submitted to the court and there would not be a judgment. But since I don't have a job currently and I am managing ongoing health problems I want to know the legal implications of signing it.Would this statement interfere with my ability to apply for disability benefits? I have talked with my doctor about this but I have not taken steps so I'm unfamiliar with the process or system. My unemployment has been prolonged by my health issues. Or if something catastrophic were to happen and I were fully disabled would this interfere in any way with claiming support?Would this statement or a judgment impact my ability to move out of ### County or out of state? I'm currently packing and planning to move as soon as I can this is really important for improving the kinds of work I can find and for availability of public transportation.Would this statement interfere with my ability to file bankruptcy if it comes to that?Do the answers to my questions depend on whether the document is submitted? In other words does this statement have any legal power if it stays in their file cabinet?What does the Verification mean?Are they bound by the agreement specified in their letter? Can they say I was late?Could they change the terms later or submit the statement to court even if I make monthly payments as agreed?They have been citing the same dollar amount in all documents since ###19 with no mention of interest. Since the account is closed and in collection I don't know what applies. I think it would be 8% if there were a judgment? And I don't know what it would be in Ch ###. I'd like this to be part of any agreement with them in order to make a sound decision.Is there any reason I'm not thinking of NOT to sign this agreement? I am not trying to avoid making payments but I want to make sure I'm not trapped in a terrible arrangement or get in trouble later because I signed this if I do this without the assistance of a lawyer or the oversight of a judge.AmericanExpress and this firm are suing people in every district court session here so they will be relentless. I have to protect myself.Many thanks for your help!"43875.81875 A software developer created a program to assist with purchase speed in regards to buying items that are highly sought after.

Whats my next step? Who should I contact? What type of attorney is best in these situations?43885.6111111111 Good afternoon, Mr. Ferrer:Thank you for your question.  Your next step is most likely to schedule an initial consultation with a business litigator with an interest in IT-related issues.  This is an expensive expertise for a lawyer to require, however, so without funds for litigation, I doubt any lawyer in private practice would handle it.  A consultation for ### ### $### $###-quality ###.  Hourly rates for litigation will typically be in the same range.  I would look at ### sized business litigation firms in ### and see if any arrangements can be worked out.  You can search on ### using the Find a Lawyer" search function near the top right of your page on that site and can also inquire with the ### County Bar.  See a link to ### below:https://www.meckbar.org/index.cfm?pg=LRS-homeThis sounds like a very interesting lawsuit to pursue.  I think a business litigation lawyer would be highly interested in this case but it would take an hourly retainer in order for taking this on to be a sound business decision from a law firm's point of view; this is not the type of thing that could be handled on a pure contingency basis.Best wishes to you as we await spring of ###."43885.7479166667 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Yes, in North Carolina, a judgment is good for ten (10) years, but in order to be good for an additional ten (10) years, it MUST be renewed BEFORE it naturally expires during the initial ten (10) years.  So assuming the ###'s lawyer, it is now void as a matter of law, and cannot be pursued against your assets.  This might still negatively affect your credit for a while, but it poses no threat to your assets in terms of execution and collection.You can check with the Clerk of Superior Court at the courthouse in whatever county the judgment was originally entered to see if it has been renewed.  They can look up your name in the judgments database and give you a printout of what they find.I hope this is helpful to you going forward.  Blessings and best wishes to you this spring, and in ###.43888.0993055556 I would like to know what is the time frame for a judgment to expire in NC. Is it true that after ###? I have a Judgment from ###. While I was serving my sentence the Judgment ### interest everyday, that it now double what it originally was. I just want to know if this Judgment even matters anymore since technically the ###.43887.8270833333 Mr. ###:I thought we covered this ground yesterday evening.  You need to proceed through the local Sheriff if you have already obtained your judgment, and, assuming the landlord is a natural person rather than a corporate entity, the person has already been served the Notice to Claim Exempt Property which must be completed by the judgment debtor within ###.  If the landlord is an LLC, corporation or other incorporated entity, the right to claim exemptions does not apply, and you can proceed almost immediately through the Sheriff with a charging order against the company's assets.I really think, as I wrote last night, that you should briefly consult with a local civil litigation lawyer, since an in-person discussion over a ### ###-and-bolts of working with the Sheriff's office to execute your judgment, than would these email exchanges here.  On this website, we try to offer you enough information to apprise you of your legal options and your next steps, but very often our answers here will need to be supplemented with comprehensive guidance.  I think that would benefit you here, and many ### County lawyers would probably not charge a lot for a consultation on this matter (try for at least ###).  This should not be overly difficult to pursue, but it is just a matter of talking through, step by step, the judgment execution process.It may be advisable to first contact the Sheriff's office and describe what you are trying to do, and then if the information you get from them is enough, you might be able to do this without a lawyer.  But more likely than not, a one hour meeting with local counsel for follow up on the Sheriff's information would benefit you and save you time by making this more efficient.Hope everything goes well.43889.6923611111 What  is the process to receive  levy against  former landlord  bank account?

In NC, Section ###-52.###  Procedure explains the statue of limitations for dent is ###, promissory notes and credit cards.

I can submit more documents if required.How do I apply this law to have this judgment dismissed or overturned? Is there a form or protocol in place to dispute this?Is the judgment valid since it's against NC law?Please advise and assist.Your assistance is greatly appreciated.43889.6861111111 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  A few clarifying things here: the three-year statute of limitations for ordinary breach of contract and loan obligation claims applies to when the lawsuit is filed, NOT when collection begins, or when a claim is completed" through the conclusion of a lawsuit.  So if the creditor filed the civil complaint within three (###) years of the date of your alleged breach the claim is allowed under N.C.G.S. Chapter ### Section ###.  Even if the creditor was outside the statute of limitations you have to properly plead expiration of statute of limitations under Rule ### of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure--in a timely submitted responsive pleading (usually an Answer with defenses incorporated therein).  So even if the creditor was in the wrong for filing the lawsuit outside of the three-year window you might still be liable under a judgment if you did not successfully plead the statutes of limitation defense during the ###0-day window following service of the Complaint (unless you timely asked for and obtained a ###0-day extension).Based on what you described here your "response" was not sufficient to overcome the claim (probably because you did this on your own and without a lawyer) and that you ### ###-###.  Please go see a local civil litigation lawyer to check over this in greater detail than is possible here but it sounds to me that the creditor will win this case based on its having obtained a valid judgment; however it is entirely possible that a lawyer with whom you meet in person will be able to read the paperwork you have and identify insights and pointers that we on this website would not necessarily be able to do based on the limits of this online forum.  You need to consult with a local civil litigator as soon as possible to ensure that whatever ### rights you might have do not expire on account of acting too late.  I think your options have significantly narrowed at this point.Best wishes to you this spring."43889.7569444444  ### people came to my house and showed me a ### vacum, I got it and put 200$ down, they said that I have ###, so I had to the 7th to change my mind, they left wrong finance papers so I called wrong finance company and they gave me the number to the right finance company  who told me I had to send a certified letter to ### and when ### got that letter they would call them, so I sent the certified letter and it was postmarked on the 7th which was the last day that I had to cancel, so since then have talked with ### and loan company several times and ### seem to get anything donewhat can I do to resolve this matter 43894.6506944444 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thanks for the question.  Aside from following whatever is required of you as the customer/consumer in the contract, this is probably more of a practical and logistics problem than a strictly legal one.  If you have done what you needed to do to properly cancel, at this point, I would simply follow up with the other parties involved in this (which sound like the lender and ### itself) and make sure that they are handling their own responsibilities in this matter.  You might need to speak with a local lawyer who regularly handles contract matters and have him/her review the contract briefly in order to offer you something more specific.  But based on what limited information I have, it sounds like you are doing what you need to do on your end.  Hopefully this situation will be straightened out in a week or so.Best wishes to you this spring in ### County.43894.7055555556 Hello, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Is this a civil lawsuit (in which case there would be a civil summons and a civil complaint), or a criminal summons?  If you are being sued in civil court, yes, the statute of limitations would have expired within three (###) years of the date of the actionable conduct.  If this was a misdemeanor in criminal court, normally prosecutions cannot occur after two years, unless it was a malicious misdemeanor.  There would be no statute of limitations for felony offenses in North Carolina.Understanding (###) whether this is civil or criminal, and (###) assuming it is criminal, whether this is a misdemeanor or felony, is critical to knowing what to do next.  If this is a civil matter, consult in person with a local civil litigation or general practice lawyer in ### County, or consult with a local criminal defense lawyer if you are facing charges.  Normally, a first-time offense for knowingly writing a bad check is a misdemeanor in NC.That's about all I can offer based on my limited knowledge of the situation.  If the court of jurisdiction is ### County, lastly, you may need to consult by phone with a lawyer there instead of ### County, but I will leave that up to you.I hope you can straighten this out soon without undue hassle, burden or expense.  Best wishes to you this spring.43895.2409722222 Last night I received papers from a sheriff that said I had written a bad check ###, NC. However, I was living in MO at the time. Is there a statue of limitations on things like this? Also, the amount was only $28.43895.1909722222 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  As someone who just recently bought a car and looked very carefully at all warranty information in order to avoid problems later, I can truly empathize with your concerns.  I think the key to getting this resolved is make sure the lender and the dealer are in communication, and that they get on the same page as soon as possible so that you can safely rely on the sale contract and warranty provisions based on the correct VIN for the vehicle you actually bought.  Until the lender and dealer cross reference the correct number and confirm that each's records are now up to date and accurate, there is probably little you can do.  The fault is not on your side, but the dealer's.  If push comes to shove after several more follow-up calls or emails, you might consider hiring a lawyer to send a letter to both the dealer and lender (with each copied on the same correspondence, along with you), advising them to correct this mistake so that you as the consumer can continue making timely payments as you have in the reliance that you can enforce warranty and all other sale contract provisions.  I hope this will not come to that, but if it does, it would probably not cost more than a couple hundred dollars for the lawyer to do so and follow up to ensure that the letter's demand are heeded.I hope that your follow ups with both parties will get this matter cleared up for good within a week or two.  Thanks for reaching out to us on NC Free Legal Answers, and a very blessed spring to you and your family.43897.8159722222 Little over ###, NC.

Student loan companies are known to negotiate if you are in default and possibly will file bankruptcy with no way to pay the loans.  If they feel you can pay the loans there is no business sense in negotiating.  Your best bet is to make larger payments tpay it oof faster and save on interest, refinance for a lower interest rate which would lower your payments but keep making the same payment so you pay it off faster.  Take the benefactors money and make a large one time payment now and keep paying your normal amoun until paid off again saving money on interest.###44098.9236111111 How much money did you give him?

See information at https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/IACOVID19FBFactSheetConsumer.pdf and https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/IACOVID19FB_FactSheetServicers.pdf.  You will end up having to pay back the missed payments after the forbearance is over.  But, you have to actually request it.As far as lowering your payments that will depend on your current mortgage.  Longest mortgage you can get is ###.  If you have say ### ###.  My advice is to not get talked into a cash out mortgage where you refinance for more to get cash as closing and increase your payments.  This is where lots of people get in trouble financially because they end up not affording the larger payments and only see those dollar signs they are receiving now.  All this will depend on the banks, your credit score, current debt load, and current income.  If you are high risk, you might end up having to foreclose on the house, sell it, or just walk away if your finances are at the level where that makes sense.Good luck,###44112.7111111111 I bought my house in ### ###% was credit and 20% was home equity.

My wife emailed the salesman a few days after I bought the car. Five days after my wife sent the email, the salesman responded by saying, he would look into it. I feel confident they are going to deny my wife the $100. I'm clearly not taking legal action over $100. However, I would like to know if they legally are obligated to pay my wife the $100.

Please adviseSincerely, ###44130.0104166667 Without seeing the complete, ###, email, this is not able to be answered accurately.

If so, might be easier to let it go until then.  I am guessing if it is effecting your credit, then your friend is not.Whose name is on the car title?  Just your friend or both of you?  If just your friend and all you did was co-sign not really much you can do.When you sign or co-sign a loan, that is a contract for money from a bank.  The bank cares about the money and you are both equally responsible for it.  Something that should have been considered before co-signing (what if my friend doesn't make all the payments?).As far as your friend refinancing, if their credit is bad they might not be able to refinance it.Did you two make any other agreement in writing and both sign it as to your friend will be fully responsible for all payments and would be liable to you for any issues that cost you money due to their failure to pay the loan?###44156.6083333333 Thank you for your responseHe is making the payments on timethe car is on his name only Iâ€™m only the secondary co-signer but Iâ€™m trying to buy a house now and in my credit it shows the debt I have with the loan that was taken out with the car.

He became lewd and creepy through text and so she stopped speaking to him. now he is trying to sue her for ever ### given to her calling it a monetary loan. He also is suing me, aware that he gave me $###. I do not even know this man. What should I do?44197.8125 ###, Thank you for the reply.Please see attached case summary.In the last few days, my real estate lawyer helped me search this old judgment and try to make sense of it. Unfortunately, she is not a litigation lawyer and cannot help me further. This is what my real estate lawyer and myself found so far:### and ### do not have this file for quite some time. After calling different departments in ### Fundings and different collection companies, my lawyer found the company who's handling the collection in this matter. It was originally a Chase revolving account and the judgment is in the amount of $4,201.72. The collection company that is handling this collection is D & A servicing co.  (1-888-###)(###). Everyone else she spoke to yesterday at ### and at ### & ###, would not speak to her and kept referring her to someone else. My lawyer told ### from D & A that I was not properly served and that, as a result, ### had no grounds to pursue a judgment against me.  She said that since I am now disputing this collection they are closing their file and sending it back to ### as a dispute. But she had no idea what happens or who it goes to at ###.  My lawyer's guess is that no one at ### will do anything about this.  There was nothing more my lawyer could do. ### is huge and it would be months before ### even figures out who is to handle this.  At this point, I believe I need to file a motion to dismiss but not sure to who. ### & ### told us that they no longer are involved in this matter but they still may accept service. Otherwise, I would probably have to serve the legal dept at ###.I spoke to the Special civil court in ### county and they told me I should file form ###. I am looking for some help to fill out the forms necessary to dismiss the case. I think I have good proof that I was never properly served. I never got any letters or notices. I don't think they know where I live.  In 2015, when I got back to live in the ### I legally changed my last name from Tsruya to Sruya (I guess this is why you couldn't find me when you searched my nameThank you,###.44218.94375 ###,First, I want to thank you again for the advice and for helping me understand my options.I'm 100% sure that the ### address was never on the credit card account.I didn't know that money was taken from my Citi bank account. I hear about it for the first time from you. How do you know? and I was wondering why did they take only $###? You are saying that it is harder to vacate a judgment after ###. Do you think there is a shot to settle for less? If yes, should I contact them myself?Thank you.44219.5701388889 I never had a real estate appraiser license in Ca, I had a real estate salesperson license and yes, I had some issue with the law and I decided to surrender my license back in 2010. I acquired my real estate appraiser in ### in ###. The fact that you can run a ### Nexis and pick up this information about me doesn't change what the information shared with you so far. This has nothing to do with my judgment. 44219.7722222222 It has plenty to do with your judgment and whether or not you were most likely properly served within the eyes of the court.  Again, you can try to vacate the judgment and then fight the original complaint or try to settle or pay the judgment in full.  Once you contact them and they get your current address and see you own a house, have a state license for your work, and live at the same address as the appraisal company, they might not want to settle and force the entire amount.  Or they might take a lower amount to get that lower amount now.  Whatever you do make sure you and the other side both sign a stipulation of settlement and file it with the courts on the judgment.44219.7791666667 Less ###: ###;">I recently found out that I have a ### outstanding judgment in the special civil part of the superior court against me from a debt creditor. At the time that this judgment was filed and served I lived overseas for a period of ### (through my foreign passport stamps or through my immigration records). I believe that the judgment was served to my father in law residence and was received by him or his wife. All these years I didn't know about the judgment until last week. Few points:I am not sure if I forwarded my mail with the post office to my father in law's address before I left the country.My driver's license address or utility bills were reporting a different address of a different state at that time.I did not have any communications with the creditor or the creditor's attorneys before or after the judgment. Can I file a motion to dismiss the case ? or choose different tactics?If I can dismiss the case is there a chance that this creditor can file for judgment against me again? Which ### statute of limitations should I follow? if it is Enforcing Court Judgments (###) then they can still come back with a new judgment?Thank you for your time."44210.0833333333 Once again I thank you for your service however I don't appreciate you telling me I wasn't truthful with you.I never said that I did not change my Citibank account address to the ### address. I said, I never changed my credit card address to ### before I left the US or while living overseas. The collection is from a chase revolving card, not from my Citibank account. Don't forget that I lived overseas when they took money from the bank account. I'm not saying that it didn't happen, I'm saying that I don't remember it happen and when you mentioned it I was surprised. Your internet search is correct and I don't question your findings. I am not trying to hide from anybody or any company, I am just assessing my legal options before I am deciding on a course of action. I am aware that they can find me anytime but I just found out about it and I am trying to resolve this matter ASAP.Thank you.44219.7430555556 Please provide information on the case and judgment (docket number, judgment number, etc.).  Please attach copies of any letter or notices you received.  I did a search for your name from ###, which could just mean ### never filed the special civil judgment with the state but that doesn't stop them.###44213.8041666667 Thank you.44219.7923611111 The Citibank account was where they levied the $###.  The ###, but they did find an address you use for something and if it is a business that is even easier for them to prove that it was served properly by sending certified mail and regular mail that was not returned as undeliverable.  I also question your name change since you voluntarily gave up your appraisal license in CA in ### rap" accusation.  I sure hope you reported the past license in CA when you applied for the license in ###.Take care###"44219.7548611111 What  when they took the $###?  Why did you legally change your name?  You need to file a motion to vacate the judgment, you can't dismiss" a judgment.  Vacate the judgment first and have to prove why you took so long.  They will use the ###'t know about the case in 2011 you should have known something at that point.  Why did you wait ###?  When you file to vacate you have to give your current address now they will have it and will be able  refile the case against you.  Did you owe the money in 2011?  Why did you leave the country and not make payments?  What was the address on your credit card account at the time you stop paying it?  That is probably the address you used.  If the certified mail was signed for by your in laws then it was properly served.###"44218.9916666667 Yes, your best bet is to settle the amount or just pay it off.  You can do it yourself or pay an attorney to help you.  A quick internet search finds that you are part of Seal Appraisals which used to have an address at ### ###, the property you own with your wife.  The Citibank account had your name on it with the ### ###.  Maybe it was a business account but what I see now is that you are not being fully truthful with me and if I can find these connections easily, a business that has the resources of a large debt collector can see this and much more.Take care,###44219.70625 You have to vacate a judgment.   You don't dismiss a judgment.  You are saying the ### address was never on the credit card account?  The money taken from your account in ### ###.  Harder to vacate judgment when more than a year from judgment.Statute of limitations won't be relevant. If judgment vacated the original case is reopened and then you fight it.  The original filing was within the statute of limitations. The credit card number is in the filings and the record of that account might still be on one of the ###.So, you need to file a motion to vacate the judgment.  When you file you must also file your answer to the original complaint as if you knew about it.  If you win the motion, you can then request discovery and go from there. ###44219.1333333333 You said: What  when they took the $###? -  Not relevant to my case.I changed my legal name because we decided that it will be a little bit easier to ### and read it when we came back to live here. I was thinking about my young children in a new school. I was not aware of this judgment until a week ago. In all my real estate purchases/ refinances title searches this judgment never came up. I recently applied for a home refinance and I guess the title company searched my name by the old name and that's why it came up now. I have no record of this debit/judgment on my credit nor anywhere else. I don't know if my in-law signed a certified mail from the court or not and I don't think he will remember. Before I left the country I lived in California, so all my bills were going to my CA address. I only changed my address to ### when I became an ### resident when moved back to the US in 2015.  (However, I'm not sure if I forwarded my mail to my in-law ### address before I left).  When I left the country I made sure that all my debt is paid off. I don't remember I even had a Chase credit card.I don't think I can prove that this debt is not mine, however, I can prove that I was out of the country for 5  straight years while this judgment was served. Instead of filing a motion to vacate can I go for a dismissal? If I do get it dismissed, what is the statute of limitation for unsettled debt?Thank you,###. 44219.0861111111 Overview, my friend and I started a music company (Aweless Agencies) a few years ago. Very small company just doing local shows. Last year we invested heavily into a major music festival for the summer (###) before the pandemic became relevant. Lost over $### (a lot of it put on credit cards) in unrefundable down payments when all major events were cancelled. Applied for SBA loan. they granted us $5,000. Since then we havent been able to do anything with the company since music events and any kind of gatherings are still prohibited. We've decided to shut down the company completely. Is there anyway to find a loan forgiveness for the $### been working or been able to do anything with the company to pay it off? Called SBA and they said if the company is dissolved the loan responsibility still goes onto the signer/owner which is me. I'm being told by friends and family that there should be a forgiveness option (especially for such a small amount) but I dont know if that actually exists. Is there anything I can do about this? 44214.7048611111 Yes, you still owe the money that you borrowed.  It is $### ###.  The only way I see you possibly getting out of it is if you have enough other debt and claim bankruptcy.  If you want to consider that option you should contact a local bankruptcy attorney to discuss your options and the pros and cons.###44215.1993055556 Whose name is on the car title/registration?

You will still be responsible for the loan but if the car is in his name only then the towing company would go after him.  The loan company might need your OK.

Do I have to pay for this?? It seems unfair to make me pay for a TERM00110### they cant show proof of use and its obviously estimated. The department it came from hung up on me when I became upset telling me its my problem and I have no other contact. I emailed customer service for written documentation showing how they can prove I owe money for their faulty equipment only to be told to call the same department that hung up on me. I refuse to pay something without proof of debt. Please give me advise. Do I contact a lawyer to reach out to them?     44217.8680555556 File a complaint with the Bureau of Public Utilities.  You should have all your monthly statements and you should have been checking on the bills if they kept saying estimated reading, but there might be a way to ague their estimates if the house was empty.

Do you have anything in writing about your promotion possibilities and were they guaranteed if you got the degree?If the debt is really a debt and cannot be forgiven, work it out with the company for a payment plan.  Of they might take you to court to get a judgment against you and then send it to debt collections.  You got an education for the tuition reimbursement.  That additional education might give you the opportunity to move up in the company if there are positions available and you are the best candidate.  You signed up for tuition reimbursement to get the education paid for with most likely some stipulations on how long you have to work after to not owe it back.###44282.8152777778 I live in ###, ###.

ON the ### side, you can ask to prove that they delivered it to the right location.  They are known to not deliver to the right location.  Just because their driver said so doesn't make it accurate.

They are asking me to turn over the title, as I own the car outright.  They owe me money on the ### as part of the deal. They say they cannot get me a check until they get the title. They gave me a â€œwe oweâ€ as a guarantee I get the money.  Is a â€œwe oweâ€ from a car dealership legally binding? 44340.03125 It is usually not a problem.  You might also be able to get them to make the payment to you at the same time you sign over the title.  This is common as part of car deals.  If it is a legitimate dealership there should be no worries.  If it is a shady used car dealership, I would question it more.###44346.9069444444 I live in Newark, ### and purchased a pre owned vehicle from a local dealership in Irvington, ###.

But, the bank account info including account numbers is required.  They are looking to put liens on the accounts, which they are legally permitted to do.  They are looking to see where you get your income so they can file for wage garnishments.  You purchased the items on credit, didn't pay, and they are permitted to use all legal tactics to recover the money.

After the loan company auctioned off the vehicles, there is still a $30,###. There is some money in the estate but no where near $30k. What is the best way to start negotiations? I donâ€™t want to offend them by offering an amount too low but there isnâ€™t much money left behind. Is there a certain percentage of the debt we can start as a minimum offer? How does the loan company know itâ€™s our best offer? Can they ask the courts for proof of how much money the estate has? Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you.  44351.7979166667 It's not really a lien.  If they already filed against the estate it is just sitting there as part of the cord when you go to close out the estate and have to show what is happening and where all the money is ### and getting approval to do it.  They are just ### their claim to their share once it is all figured out.  They would get paid first before any money is distributed to the heirs.  They are basically a collection agency and your sister can try to negotiate, but they don't need to because they know they will get their full amount if it is available in the estate.###44351.8631944444 Sister is the administrator. They filed the debt to the estate through the courts during ###20. As of today, they havenâ€™t filed a lien on the estate. Would negotiating at this point likely prevent the lien? Thanks. 44351.8333333333 Who is the surrogate appointed administrator of the estate?  That person has to deal with it all as part of the estate.  If there is money in the estate, debts are paid in a certain order.  Then if there is anything left after that then the rest can be distributed to the heirs according to the laws.  If there is probate open, they can file a lien on the estate.  You can try to negotiate, but since there is an estate most will file a lien against the estate.###44351.8090277778 It would seem I may be facing a bank levy on a credit card debt in which I am being sued for.

It is not exempt income like Social Security, Disability, etc.  There are minimums you are permitted to own and earn that can be exempt and you can argue that at court when the time comes.  You should talk to a bankruptcy attorney.  If the total debt owed (not including student loans) is high, the about $### cost for a Chapter ###.

I called the debt collector and they will not make a payment arrangement with me if I motion to vacate the default judgement.

You can leave the business account out of it, but they might push it later.###44364.8020833333 Again, at time of purchase, they did nothing wrong.  Because you feel they should have notified everyone of the new plans and you didn't get notified or possibly it went to your spam folder, etc., is not fraud.  They are not required to provide personal notice of new products to you.You stated several weeks after you got the machine the you the screen was completely cracked turned completely black with occasional shades of different colors appearing on the screen. I was quickly able to determine that the screen was badly damaged and was beyond repair."  You also stated that upon closer inspection at you noticed this. It doesn't take close inspection to notice a totally cracked and completely black screen.You can always file a complaint yourself or search for a consumer fraud attorney locally to take the case since if they feel their is a case that they can get their attorney fees from Apple if they win.  Might be a reason ### attorneys won't take the case because there is no case.Take care###"44366.0944444444 Another issue, and if you go to the store and want to purchase the AppleCare+ plan separately, even a couple hours after the sale, you need to have the computer inspected first to qualify.  If there is any fraud, it would be on your end trying to buy the protection after you damaged the product.  Kind of like changing your liability only car insurance to comprehensive after you have an accident.  Insurance companies require a photo inspection of a car when insuring it and not coming from the dealer brand new.  AppleCare+ is an insurance you purchase prior to having any problems.###44365.5208333333 Not official, but shows another statement about buying it after the fact.  The diagnostic would of found a problem with the screen and you would not have been able to purchase the plan after breaking the screen.Still to buy AppleCare+ after the fact you generally have to run a diagnostic test on the device in question so Apple knows itâ€™s in good working order. And no matter when you buy your AppleCare+ plan the coverage starts from the day you bought your device. So you donâ€™t get an â€œextraâ€ two months of coverage if you wait two months to buy the plan."https://www.macworld.com/article/230521/applecare-warranty-faq.html"44365.5236111111 Potential violation of ### Consumer Fraud Act by Apple. violation of the ### Consumer Fraud Act. On ### I purchased a new MacBrook Pro laptop from the Apple Store at The Mall at Short Hills. In addition to the computer I also purchased the Apple Protection Plan, which was the onay insurance that was offered. The cost for this service at the time of purchase was $###. The total amount of the transaction was $1,889.###, protection plan, USBC to USB ### cord along with sales tax. If a customer does not enroll in the protection plan at the time of the sale, Apple allows a user ###. So essentially had I not purchased the protection plan when I bought the computer I would have had until ### to enroll.  Several weeks after the transaction I had my phone plugged into the laptop and accidently closed the screen on the cord. This was not done with much force so I had no reason to believe that any damage had been done to the computer. However, upon closer inspection it became ### that the screen was completely cracked, turned completely black with occasional shades of different colors appearing on the screen. I was quickly able to determine that the screen was badly damaged and was beyond repair. Initially I was not too concerned because since I had spent $### $###. Unbeknownst to me, after I purchased the laptop and within the ###, Apple introduced an ### program called AppleCare Plus which allows users to have their screen replaced for $###. Being a brand new owner of an Apple laptop I believe it was their duty to alert eligible customers of the option to enroll in the upgraded protection plan. However, I was not informed nor was it heavily advertised so I had no idea that it existed. I have not been able to use the computer since because I cannot afford to pay $###. Not only is the laptop unusable I also lost important files and documents. I believe Apple violated the Consumer Fraud Act and should be held accountable. It is my understanding that if a plaintiff prevails the defendant is subject to treble damages. So I believe I should be compensated roughly $5,###. Do you believe I have a valid claim?44365.2861111111 So, you believe it is Apple's responsibility to inform you of new products/warranty options after you purchase a product.  Sorry, that is a nice of the company to do, but not legally required.  If there was a recall, yes, there are requirements to attempt to notify consumers.  I see no violation since there was no fraud in the sale of the product to you.  It's also been ###.  The statute of limitations for fraud is ###, but I don't see fraud here.  At the time of sale, no fraud was committed.###44365.5125 Thank you for your responses. However, I was not insinuating that I had intended to purchase AppleCare + after the computer was already damaged. The screen broke several months after it was purchased and I agree that an inspection would have had to have taken place akin to an insurance adjuster. My point is had I known that there was a more comprehensive protection plan available I would have upgraded immediately considering the cost associated with repairs. A simple email blast to folks who recently bought a device that would qualify for AppleCare + would have been sufficient. Otherwise how else would I have known that a better plan existed?Based upon my research I identified the following language that I believe closely resembles my situation.

Meaning, will I be held accountable in court for the reason I answer and deny owing the money. I believe my best option is to follow what you said and answer it with a denial now, and then try and negotiate the price down because, for $1000, it doesn't seem worth an attorney.Also, can I leave the attorney area blank on the answer form if I haven't gotten one yet, but will potentially speak with one?

That will give you a court date in the future.  They will probably then request discovery to see what you owe where, your employment, bank accounts, etc.  At the trial date you will have an opportunity to try to negotiate a lower payoff amount, but if you are employed and they know it, they really don't need to negotiate, but you can try.After filing the answer, you can contact the attorney and see if they will settle for half the total or somewhere between half and the full amount.  Sometimes they will just to get most of the money and move on.  Any settlement agreement will include a penalty clause that if you don't pay whatever is agreed on time that the full amount is automatically considered owed and judgment is automatically entered for that amount.###44393.0673611111 You eed to give some reason - maybe withdrew from school due to personal matters no longer needed housing and never moved in""44395.8041666667 You just deny each accusation and put your name as Pro Se.

Did you have a written agreement when it was purchased what would happen to it when roommate situation changed?  If you can't work out an arrangement then you risk him taking you to court for taking it.  You might want to offer him hi share plus the roommate that left share.

They also have ###. He fell behind in payments, he did contact loan company multiple times. They were evicted from one rental (house being knocked down due to mold and age, sold for property value). They were living off of one person's unemployment & moved into a winter rental. I too had work hours cut due to Covid. I support myself, am widowed. Next thing happened was that son and wife not working, no money had drug problems. Long story short- I now have custody of their ### 9 & ###. I am now supporting them also without any money yet from state. The loan company is suing myself and my son. (We are in ### County ###) There is no court date yet but there is one pending I'm sure. It says in this summons that we REFUSED TO MAKE PAYMENTS AND REFUSED TO RETURN CAR TO THEM"- NOT TRUE AT ALL.  There is no way I can pay his car loan and this all came about largely once everything with Covid hit. My credit now has taken a big hit when before this I had EXCELLENT credit. I am sick over this and not sure what to do. My son has the "summons" he tried twice now to contact that lawyer and left message w/the secretary but is getting no return calls. He will be going into rehab within the coming week which leaves me hanging. I should also mention besides now taking on two young children (who I love being my grandchildren) being widowed I am also a month shy of turning ###. old. Oh I should also mention that back in December right before Christmas my son's wife was out trying to get Christmas presents for their boys and got pulled over. Turned out the registration and insurance for my son's Jeep (involved in the lawsuit) was impounded. Not having much money and right before Christmas they couldn't get it out of impound. The place it was taken to in Pt. Pleasant Beach jacked the price up daily making it impossible to get out. Between the police dept. & the owner of the auto body shop my son or wife couldn't find out if the Jeep was even still at autobody shop. This car had a lot of their clothes the children's clothes and toys in it and they were not allowed to get any of it. It was not until my son went to the shop w/the summons and told the owner that he needed to know where the Jeep was that he was told it's still there. This IS a nightmare."44403.875 Yes, this sounds like a mess.  But, as far as the loan, since you co-signed it you are equally responsible for the amount left on the loan.  The rest seems to be personal choices that have caused more of a mess.  Getting into drugs, driving a car without registration and insurance but spending money on gifts.  You might have to tell the court where the Jeep is and let the loan company go after it but with the impound fees it might not work out in your favor financially and you might still owe money on the loan.###44429.5694444444 I was supposed to pick up a car in ### last Saturday and made a cash deposit in the account provided to me the Friday prior at ### for them to tell me that they had no way of getting access to their account and verify the transaction over the weekends.

If ### is telling you such a large increase ask for a detailed accounting for that amount since 2015.  It looks like they were wrong a few times with the amount looking at the court record.

I hope you can help me with this issue44457.7284722222 I have an engineering services consulting company that was performing work for a client (Qoscience) in the telecommunications industry.  Through the initial part of the consulting contract, I acquired equity shares in Qoscience.  During a later part of the contract in mid-2018, the company's prime customer withdrew and the company subsequently halted operations with s significant amount of outstanding debt, of whom most of the debtholders were also shareholders.  The company remained open since there was a patent granted to it that could have future value.  The debtors entered into an agreement with the company not to pursue repayment or bankruptcy for a period ending 1/2022.  This allowed Qoscience to shop around and sell the rights to this patent to a 3rd company for an initial payment (that would partially pay down the debts) and future royalties from any product developed with the ### technology.The company that purchased the patent never developed any products around the ### technology and it is uncertain if they completed the transaction merely to mothball a potentially competing technology.  No further payments were made after the initial payment.Now that the end of the agreed time period is close, some activity is happening.  The founder and majority shareholder of Qoscience has declared personal bankruptcy. The estate trustee has sold all his shares in Qoscience for a negligible amount to another shareholder who is the ### debt holder who currently runs a business manufacturing telecommunications equipment.  There was a clause in the company bylaws ('###' rights) requiring any purchase of the stock to include the stock of any other owner that wanted to sell it at the same price.  I had no reason to sell for a negligible sum point but the large debt holder did not seem interested in obtaining all the shares, merely a majority amount.That new majority shareholder has now organized a shareholders meeting on Oct. 20, ###: to dissolve the existing board and install him as the sole new board member, and to revise the company bylaws, and provided a copy of the new bylaws.I am not sure what his plans are for Qoscience but would like my outstanding debt (about $###) repaid.  One possible plan for the new majority shareholder is to threaten legal action to the 3rd party company that purchased the rights to the patent for never developing its technology as it said it would and hope for a settlement.I can hold the shares indefinitely and have no concern if they end up ###, but would like the outstanding debt to be repaid.  I am not sure what legal avenues I have available to pursue this goal. I would like to know any possibilities before the Oct.###.Thanks for any assistance you can provide.Regards,### Cosentino44471.7340277778 I live in New ###. I was looking into filing chapter ###.

Did you get shares in exchange for the work?  You agreed to those shares in exchange for the work?If it is shares of a company, it is like any other risky investment.  If you want to file a complaint against the company with the way they do business, this free service is not capable of those requests or answering questions because it would take investigating and analyzing all the evidence.  If you don't have a majority share and unless you can show criminal actions and not just poor business decisions.  You should consult a local business attorney to discuss the entire case if this is the route you want to go.If it is money owed that was never paid, then you can file a complaint against the company, I am guessing your company filing against their company which will require you to use an attorney if your company is any sort of business entity like an LLC, Inc, Co.  For the amount in question it would be a filing in the Law Division.

Through the initial part of the consulting contract, I acquired equity shares in Qoscience.  During a later part of the contract in mid-2018, the company's prime customer withdrew and the company subsequently halted operations with s significant amount of outstanding debt, of whom most of the debtholders were also shareholders.  The company remained open since there was a patent granted to it that could have future value.  The debtors entered into an agreement with the company not to pursue repayment or bankruptcy for a period ending 1/2022.  This allowed Qoscience to shop around and sell the rights to this patent to a 3rd company for an initial payment (that would partially pay down the debts) and future royalties from any product developed with the ### technology.The company that purchased the patent never developed any products around the ### technology and it is uncertain if they completed the transaction merely to mothball a potentially competing technology.  No further payments were made after the initial payment.Now that the end of the agreed time period is close, some activity is happening.  The founder and majority shareholder of Qoscience has declared personal bankruptcy. The estate trustee has sold all his shares in Qoscience for a negligible amount to another shareholder, who is the ### debt holder, who currently runs a business manufacturing telecommunications equipment.  There was a clause in the company bylaws ('###' rights) requiring any purchaser of the stock to include the stock of any other owner that wanted to sell it at the same price.  I had no reason to sell for a negligible sum point but the large debt holder did not seem interested in obtaining all the shares, merely a majority amount.That new majority shareholder has now organized a shareholders meeting on Oct. 20, ###: to dissolve the existing board and install him as the sole new board member, and to revise the company bylaws, and provided a copy of the new bylaws.I am not sure what his plans are for Qoscience but would like my outstanding debt (about $###) repaid.  One possible plan for the new majority shareholder is to threaten legal action to the 3rd party company that purchased the rights to the patent for never developing its technology as it said it would and hope for a settlement.I can hold the shares indefinitely and have no concern if they end up ###, but would like the outstanding debt to be repaid.  I am not sure what legal avenues I have available to pursue this goal. I would like to know any possibilities before the Oct.###.Thanks for any assistance you can provide.Regards,### Cosentino44474.7180555556 Unless they voluntarily just pay you, no the long process to get a judgment and then collect on that judgment.###44474.7986111111 You will have to supply the entire question.

The bank froze my account. After speaking with them by phone, they told me it looks like attempted fraud" that my account was "too high risk" and they would close the account and return my balance to me. The check was a balance transfer check from my credit card with the same bank. They deposited it and reversed it. I never was able to pay out the two credit cards I was transferring my cc debt from. I never attempted to use the money. They never charged a returned check fee.This was two weeks ago. They have been sitting on it ever since and when I call they refuse to speak to me and put me into a voicemail.

Enough problems for me to put a security freeze on my credit reports.

While filing for bankruptcy does affect your credit for years after the bankruptcy, it gives you a fresh start and does not prevent you from buying a house or car in the future.

The best thing you can do is have a free consultation with a bankruptcy lawyer in your area.Here is a list of attorneys in your area who practice in bankruptcy court.

If yes, please post a copy for my review.  You can redact names.  As for suing the officers of the company you would have to base that on fraudulent conduct - meaning they tricked you into signing up for the trip.  Otherwise the company would be the only entity responsible for a refund if you can establish that it breached the agreement.44142.7458333333 Hello, I am a former student at FIU. While at FIU, I was in a school organization called, letâ€™s just say Missions Are Us. They planned a trip for a group of students to go to ###. As you may know, this trip was cancelled in March due to Covid-###. Some of the students paid the trip in full (about $###) and some paid on the way before it was cancelled. I paid about $### $###. This organization has not handled this situation well, forcing me to report them to the State Attorney General. To this day only a certain amount of students received partial refunds of about $###. A couple of us, about ###, have not received a dime. Missions Are Us wants us to sign a contract (that seems like a child ### up) taking away their responsibility and giving it to the travel agency they booked the trip with, which is Skylux Travel. The ### claim they gave Skylux full refunds for all the tickets. Missions Are Us has bullied and threatened us multiple times, making us drop disputes with our banks in order to get refunds. But have not given these so called refunds. They are the ones who knowingly took our money and managed it. But when it comes to the time to receive our funds, they back away and only give their officers full refunds instead. They even had us purchase a travel ticket protection plan that did absolutely nothing. I have already reported Skylux to the Federal Trade Commission and the Better Business Bureau. I also reported Skylux to the US Department of Transportation and ### Attorney General. Missions Are Us has threatened students with a lawyer. They haven't handled any situation correctly. I even spoke to the leader of this organization, letâ€™s just say â€œ###â€, and he had the audacity to say they have done everything they can. I want advice on how to go about this because a group of us are thinking about suing everyone involved, including the ###. They have caused stress, anxiety, and depression on a group of us because of this. Most of us are struggling due to COVID-###. I changed some of the names to protect myself.44107.0472222222 The only written agreement we have when we signed up for the trips is the application which is on google forms.

For the past year and half I have had no issues with the vehicle. I took a trip to ###, ### to visit family Mid ###. One day, will traveling on the ###, the hood of the vehicle flew up and back, smashing into the windshield, due to no fault of my own. There was no collision, there was no other vehicle involved, the hood latch just simply ### while driving. The damages include a cracked windshield, damage to the passenger side mirror, broken hood/hood latch and a dent in the roof. The vehicle is now in need of repairs which my insurance will partially cover. Per the insurance company/the mechanic, the vehicle had serious damage prior to my purchase and this information was not disclosed to me by the dealer ### Car Credit.  This information was also not listed on the Carfax report provided during the purchase of the vehicle. Now, although I have full coverage insurance, I am required to cover a substantial amount of the damages which has placed me in sever debt due to being laid off because of COVID-19. I am seeking assistance in suing the car dealership due to the fact that I was sold â€œtotaled vehicleâ€ without being informed of such damages prior to purchase. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you.44109.84375 Thank you for your time and response 44147.6597222222 This is a very strange sequence of events.  You were able to drive the vehicle with no issues for a year and a half, presumably driving at highway speeds for much of that time, before the hood latch failed.  Even if the vehicle had serious damage prior to your purchase, that damage would have to affect the ability of the hood to stay secure at highway speeds for you to have a claim for this incident.  In other words, unless you can show that the prior damage is what caused the hood to come loose suddenly, you will have difficulty in establishing liability for the damages from the incident.  Hyundais have pretty good warranties, so this may be a warranty issue as well.  You might want to take the vehicle to a Hyundai dealer to see what the manufacturer can do.  I am not sure why you are required to cover a substantial amount of the damages if you have full insurance coverage.  Your out of pocket costs should be limited to your deductible.If the seller of the vehicle did not disclose to you the fact that the vehicle had serious damage, you may have a different claim against that dealer for fraud, separate from the incident with the hood.  While you would have to show a connection between the prior damage and the hood failure to be compensated for that, the seller would be responsible for disclosing all known defects or material conditions, because it affects the value of the vehicle.  Carfax usually has some sort of coverage or warranty for its reports as well, but I think it depends on if the information was available to Carfax.  So, for example, if the vehicle was seriously damaged and the repairs were done by an unlicensed mechanic or illegitimate repair shop, then it is possible that no one would know about it, including Carfax, and maybe even the dealer.  But if you can find out through police reports or vehicle title documents that the vehicle was in an accident, you probably have a claim for fraud or misrepresentation.  I would recommend that you hire a lawyer to represent you for this kind of claim.44138.6479166667 I had a ### loan when I was in school ### $8,### ###'t worry about it well three years later in ### $6,### $### disabled and the judge wouldn't helpI've been getting my wages garnished from my part-time job for a year and a half I've paid them over $###,### ### ###'re saying I now owe 17,###'re adding four point seven five percent interest every year so at this rate I'm never going to pay it off is there anyway I can go get a lawyer who will help me?

The judge entered a default against you when you did not answer the amended complaint.  You may have moved but it was your responsibility to keep the clerk of the court and the plaintiff's attorney informed of your new address once you were served with the summons and complaint.Prejudgment interest is added to the principal amount owed at the time the judgment is entered.  That interest runs from the time the debt was due and owing to the date of the judgment.  The entire judgment amount accrues post-judgment interest in the amount set by law.  The interest is adjusted on judgments by law at the beginning of each new year.  Under Florida law the interest does not ### post-judgment.

I am sorry I could not be of more help.  44110.8736111111 Dear Ms. Northern,Questions on this site usually drop off after ###, so your post is likely about to be deleted by the ###.  Hopefully this matter is already finalized and over.  However I wanted to post a reply just in case.Based on what you wrote it was the vehicle owner's responsibility to see that it was not towed initially.  After the tow, it remained the owner's duty to determine why it was towed, who towed it, and where it was towed - and to take action to have the vehicle moved elsewhere and stop storage charges from accruing.  Regardless of your daughter's personal circumstances which in part contributed to her inaction, she remained responsible for her vehicle.  Yes, tow and storage fees are usually quite expensive.  There would be towing and storage due whether the city had the vehicle towed or your insurance company had it towed.  This would be a distinction without a difference - just perhaps a debt to a different tow loApparently the damage to the vehicle far exceeded its value, and it was considered a total loss.   The car was upside down" -- the debt on the vehicle was far greater than the value.  The insurance company only owes up to the value of the vehicle unless you purchased additional "gap" ### insure you against the difference between the value and the debt.  Apparently your daughter did not purchase GAP insurance which in hindsight would have been worth the cost.  I'm sure you already know this.The vehicle needed to be removed from the tow lot or the storage charges would still continue to accrue.  The insurance company needed to remove the vehicle to dispose of it as salvage or whatever and pay the tow lot in order to secure its release.  Although I cannot be 100% certain without reviewing all of the documents involved and applicable law my best guess is that the insurance company was within its rights to deduct the expenses from the tow lot out of the insurance proceeds payable to your daughter.  If your daughter had responsibly attended to the vehicle or had someone assist her the storage fees could have been minimized.  This was the owner's responsibility not the insurance company.Again this matter is most likely already resolved.  If it is not and in order to pursue it further you could retain an attorney for advice and possible representation.  As I have often told my clients and my now adult children never co-sign for a debt unless you are prepared to pay it yourself.  As long as you (or your daughter) continue to make the payments as due the loss of the vehicle should not affect your credit negatively.  Hopefully this will be a learning experience for your daughter albeit a costly one.Best wishes."43476.9125 I am the co signer on a car for my ###ghter that was crashed into while parked on a city snow route.

Your attorney can review the relevant documents, the history of the matter and advise you as to your rights.  This is beyond the scope of this forum for specific civil law questions.  The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function on its site, which may be useful for you to find an attorney to hire.  The link is here:  http://missourilawyershelp.org/find-lawyer/There are certain notices a lienholder is required to send before repossession of a vehicle.  If you have moved or if you did not pick up certified mail (for example), the lienholder may have sent the required notices.  Since you are probably dealing with a company that is in the business of making auto loans, it would surprising (but not impossible) that a notice of the right to cure was not sent.  There also might be specific provisions of your particular contract applicable to default and repossession which might apply.  The contractual provisions from the purchase and loan should be reviewed by your lawyer.I'm not sure why there would be any confusion about the ###.  This information should be on the loan paperwork and certainly on your car title.  The business at which you purchased the vehicle probably is not the financing entity.  Just look at your title for the lienholder information.A lienholder is usually named as an insured on the vehicle's insurance.  So a lienholder would have standing to make an insurance claim for damage to the vehicle.  Again, you need to have a conference with an attorney to review the documents and facts involved.I can't speculate if you can regain possession of the vehicle by paying the delinquent payments and fees (and repossession and storage charges).   A repossession would not occur until after the time period provided by a notice to cure.  After that time, the lender would not be required to reinstate the loan.  Payment of the total balance of the loan with repossession and storage charges would enable you to get the vehicle back.I am sorry your son was frightened, but apparently you were delinquent in your car payments and therefore a repossession occurred.  This would not for the basis for your son to have a claim against either you for not making the payments or the repossession company for doing its job.  I would suggest you assemble the purchase, loan, payment, registration, insurance and any other documents and meet with an attorney as soon as possible to determine your options.  Thank you.   43454.9555555556 ### - ### ### I LLC VS ### ###Ms. ###,Unless you are a court-appointed guardian for your husband, you cannot represent him or appear in court for him.  At the first court date the judge would probably continue the case to give you time to hire an attorney to represent your husband under the circumstances.The suit is from a debt buyer, which often lacks sufficient records to prove its case.   Debt buyers purchase large blocks of debt for pennies on the dollar.   Debt buyers also rarely will go to trial, and will not send a witness to testify.  Depending on the original creditor, there may also be a contractual right to move the case to arbitration.  This can frequently be desirable, depending on the amount involved in the case.  If there is an arbitration right in the credit card agreement, the consumer has to post $0.### $250.###, and the creditor will then have to post a deposit of $###-$###.  Rarely (if ever) will a credit card debt buyer put up the month for their share of the arbitration, so this is usually a successful way to defend the case.  It looks like the suit is for about $###.I strongly suggest you meet with an attorney and go over your husband's overall financial situation.  His social security funds are not able to be attached by creditors, even after a judgment.  Depending on what else he owns, it may not matter if there is a judgment entered or not, if it's totally ###.  You should get some guidance.  It's possible that some asset planning" would need to be done to ensure that a judgment cannot be enforced and that may be the most cost effective way to deal with the situation.  While debt buyer lawsuits are relatively easy to defend most of the time it may not be worth the cost for an attorney to defend the suit. You should meet with a local attorney to determine whether or not the lawsuit needs to be ### or not if it would be advisable to move the case to arbitration if available if a small settlement amount should be offered or if there's no reason to even bother to defend the case.  You might need to make sure that your husband's name is removed from attachable assets after consultation with an attorney.Best wishes."43456.75625 My husband has been summoned to appear in court for breech of contract. His only income is social security. I take care of him because he has dementia. Can I go to court instead and explain to them what is going on? He is mentally unable to make these decisions for himself.43454.7972222222 ###,Thanks for posting your question.  I'm glad to point you in the right direction.  You are correct that Social Security Disability is generally exempt from garnishment.  Nevertheless, it  is not exempt if the debt is owed the federal government or if the debt is for current or back child support.In answer to your question, your first statement is correct . . . the creditor can still obtain a judgment against you (if it is a valid debt), but your social security disability cannot be garnished or attached in satisfaction of that debt.  If they obtain a judgment, a creditor can still try to collect other ways, e.g., garnish other income, seize portions of your bank account that are not from social security, seize a car, house or other property, etc.  It would be best to sit down with a local attorney and review the lawsuit and your specific situation before you make any decisions on how you wish to proceed.I hope this helps.  If you have any follow up questions, please don't hesitate to reply.  Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck with this matter.43461.8104166667 I am being sued in ### County, Missouri, for a debt of $###.  My sole income is Social Security disability.  I understand that disability income is exempt from garnishment.  Does that mean that I can still have a judgement against me for the debt but the money can't be collected from my Social Security.  Or does it mean that I can ask the court to dismiss the suit because of my exempt income status?43460.9791666667 First off you have to provide the information for the opposing parties in order for a lawyer to assess whether or not the lawyer has previously represented that party for conflicts purposes.  Your response of N/A" fails to do that and is in fact not accurate as you allege that you are being sued so there must be an opposing party.As for your issue I can appreciate your frustration in being asked to pay for a vehicle that is no longer functional but you are misdirecting that frustration. To illustrate let's assume some different facts. Instead of you being the person leasing the vehicle let's say I leased the vehicle and am making the lease payments to you when the vehicle suddenly catches on fire and is destroyed through no fault of mine.  Being a wise business person the lease that you had me sign makes it clear that I owe the lease payments to you regardless of whether or not the vehicle is still working.  This of course makes perfect sense as you had to pay for the car up front in order to be able to accept lease payments so you would be out several thousand dollars if the lease contract provided otherwise.  Now ask yourself should I have to pay you what I promised to pay you at the outset?  Remember that while it is not my fault that the vehicle burned up it also isn't your fault either.Legally you are going to be bound by the agreement that you entered into but that does not mean that you do not have any legal recourse available to you. If the vehicle caught on fire because of some design or manufacturing defect then ### is on the hook provided that it is still under warranty.  I suspect that the problem that arose is that it was no longer under warranty.  I recognize that you say it only had ### ### ###.  I suspect that ### examined the car and found that it had significantly more miles on it and that it was no longer under warranty which would explain why it didn't get resolved.If it was sold to you with substantially more miles on it than the odometer reflected then it is possible that the seller either knew or should have known that it was tampered with which may provide you with some legal recourse against the dealer.  The state documents the number of miles from the odometer whenever the car is inspected so that should reveal if the car had more miles on it at a prior inspection which I believe the car dealership should have access to. The Missouri Merchandising Practices Act (###) could provide you with a remedy against the dealer.  The ### also has a fee shifting provision to allow you to recover your attorneys fees from the dealer so you can likely find an attorney to handle this for you at little to no out of pocket cost to you.I suggest that you look for a local attorney experienced with ### suits (ideally against car dealers) to assist you with this matter.  Best of luck to you and have a safe and Happy New Year!"43467.7013888889 Should i have to pay for the car that caught on fire in my driveway?

"43467.9027777778 Ms. ###,You certainly can sue your nephew and try to obtain a judgment against him.  I could not speculate as to whether or not any judgment you obtain will be able to be collected.  I assume you can document that you gave your nephew the $11,###.  But that would not by itself prevent (for example) your nephew claiming the funds were a gift to him.Since you apparently did not reduce your agreement to written form, it would be extremely helpful for your case to be able to document the terms of the loan.  This can sometimes be done via text messages, written correspondence, recorded conversations, etc.  I would suggest you confer with an attorney for specific advice and representation.  The attorney can discuss with you how to best attempt to document the loan to your nephew and the repayment terms, including the parameters for recording conversations in Missouri.The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function on its web site, which can assist you in locating an appropriate local attorney.  The link is:  http://missourilawyershelp.org/find-lawyer/I would strongly suggest that before filing suit against your nephew that you try to document the terms of your agreement.  The attorney you hire to represent you in the lawsuit can discuss with you the best ways to do this and the specific admissions you would want to secure.Best wishes.43469.9472222222 My nephew had me take out an $11,###.  I was stupid enough to not get anything in writing.  Of course,  now  he won't pay me.

Such a deposit is usually not refundable, except as provided by your agreement, receipt or store policy.  Where did you get the idea that you would be able to ask for it back if you failed to go through with the purchase?  The default position on most deposits - whether for a car or an apartment or another type of purchase -- unless otherwise stated in the contract or agreement, is that a deposit is not refundable. Actually ###.  Was there a sign at the location or something else on the documents which expressed this policy?  Usually a deposit is refundable or non-refundable depending on what's written in a contract, on a receipt, or posted at the dealership. So, if the buyer decides not to buy, they lose the deposit. If the dealership sells the vehicle, when a deposit is suppose to hold it, the buyer can sue.  But absent any specific language that the deposit is refundable, the default position is generally non-refundable.  From the car ### perspective, they were unable to sell the car to anyone else and it took up a space on their business premises for three weeks.  This would be the basis for forfeiture of your deposit.You didn't indicate exactly how many days had passed when you cancelled the sale, or the amount of your deposit.  Sometimes an auto seller will agree to apply your deposit to the purchase of another vehicle even though not legally required to do so.  The amount involved would probably determine whether it is worth a consultation with an attorney who could review all the documents and facts involved, and see if there was a basis for a lawsuit.A forfeited deposit is in the nature of liquidated damages for your breach of contract in failing to complete the purchase.  If it is excessively high, this could help form the legal basis for a claim of unconscionability.  If your purchase was contingent upon financing through the seller, this could also help your case.  These are issues you could explore in consultation with an attorney.There is probably little risk in filing your own small claims case, and hoping you draw a sympathetic judge.  Without knowing a great deal more, there is chance of a counterclaim for your breach of contract if the seller later sold the vehicle for less than your contractual obligation.  In other words, if you agreed to buy the vehicle for $25,### $###, a counterclaim for the $###.Best wishes.43476.2118055556 My husband and I were looking to buy a vehicle.

Except for an advance directive and my final will and testament designating beneficiary, executor, or emergency contact,  I have no documents as such.  Have a great day!!43481.9277777778 I'm glad that you have a will but an advance directive alone is inadequate if it is in fact truly just an advance directive.  Basically an advance directive (commonly called a living will) merely states your desires regarding your care under given circumstances but does not authorize any individual to act on those desires.  What is considered the standard today is to have a Durable Power of Attorney (DPOA) for Healthcare as that grants a given individual legal authority to make healthcare decisions on your behalf.  These always contain a healthcare directive detailing your desires for given circumstances to provide guidance to whomever you grant the power of attorney.  The reason that a Healthcare DPOA is important is that it eliminates any issues with healthcare providers' concerns about someone making those decisions.  If you do not have a Healthcare DPOA the hospital will balk at taking action if you have two family members with ### views as to what action to take.  I recognize that the medical community has taken to using the ### Advance Directive" to refer to all of these documents so it may well be that what you have is in fact a Healthcare DPOA but I wanted to bring this to your attention in case it is not.The Missouri Bar has prepared a form for this purpose which it makes freely available to the public for its use.  The document and information regarding it can be found at the following link: http://missourilawyershelp.org/legal-topics/durable-power-of-attorney-for-health/  I am also attaching the document along with the accompanying HIPAA release.  If you choose to utilize these forms it looks like they have instructions included within them to assist you in completing them yourself.  Mind you I do not use these forms having drafted my own for use with clients but presumably these should be adequate for your needs.The types of documents that I am talking about are likely to be among admitting paperwork at a hospital.  In amongst all of the papers that are commonly presented when going to the ER etc. is likely to be some sort of payment authorization.  It will contain language about authorizing the charges be submitted to ###. so the person presenting it may say it is just for insurance but it likely also contains language that could make whoever signs that document legally liable for the treatment expense.  That is what I am ### you about having anyone else sign.  If you have gone ahead and completed the Healthcare DPOA then whomever you appointed as your attorney in fact in the Healthcare DPOA can likely get away with signing by adding "as DPOA" after his/her name.  Note technically for that to be proper you would need to have appointed that person for a General DPOA (which authorizes them to handle your finances) as opposed to just a Healthcare DPOA.  However by signing as DPOA that should make it clear that the person is not intending to sign on their own behalf but in fact on your behalf.I have likely given you too much information for it to clearly sink it so feel free to contact me later with any questions.

So ordinarily your mother would not be on the hook for her husbandâ€™s debts. However, you mentioned that much of this debt is for medical treatment. The doctrine of necessities holds a spouse liable for those expenses of the other spouse if the expenses were necessary for that other spouse. Accordingly she is going to be liable for the bills associated with his final illness. As far as the bank is concerned, since a judgment was entered against her husband there may already be a judgment lien on the property if he was on the deed. 43493.2958333333 There is no lien on the property yet. Can she file bankruptcy on his debts?43493.7173611111 I attempted to buy ### of ### tickets from what I thought was the official website for the ### Center for the Performing ###.  I realized, too late, I was not on their website. They had my credit card information.  I tried to cancel the order, but I only received an e-mail  directing where I could print the tickets. I was not given any other option.  I had no working printer, so I could not print them.  Discover Card said I should pay, even tough I did not receive the tickets, nor I could not attend the performance.43492.9645833333 Mr. ###,I'm having trouble finding a legal question in what you wrote.  This forum is for specific civil law questions.If I understand correctly, you purchased performance tickets from a site other than the ### Center, such as ###.  It makes no difference where you purchased them.  There are many, many secondary market ticket sellers.   Some ### even have more than one primary ticket sellers.The vast majority of tickets for events today are issued electronically, and there are no physical tickets issued.  It appears you purchased the tickets and charged the purchase on a Discover card.  Apparently you chose to not make the effort to print the tickets anywhere else and did not use use them.  You could certainly dispute the charge with Discover card, but this is unlikely to succeed unless the seller fails to respond in time to the dispute.   It's possible you will get lucky."  But you absolutely should pay the charge on your credit card on time even if you are filing a dispute so that you do not incur interest and fees.The ticket seller provided the link from which you could access download and print your tickets.   This would have fulfilled its obligations.   You had no working printer at home at the time.  This is your problem. There are ### ways you could have printed your tickets - by accessing the link online somewhere other than your home such as a public library or downloading the tickets in .pdf format onto a flash drive or phone and then printing them elsewhere.  You could have forwarded the email to a friend neighbor or relative who did have a printer at home or work.  You could have gone to anyone's house with an internet connection (or your flash drive) and a printer.  There are countless Kinko's ### printing offices Office ### Max Staples and other retail printing locations.  The tickets could have been printed anywhere.You should thoroughly review the terms on the site from which you bought the tickets but virtually all tickets are non-refundable.  Physical tickets when available usually involve an additional service fee or charge.  It's extremely remote that the seller could possibly have any responsibility for a refund AFTER the event.Unfortunately unless there's something I'm missing here or misinterpreted you seem to have created your own problem.  I doubt you will be able to recover the money you paid for the tickets you (in effect) decided not to use by making no effort to print them.If there's something additional you wish to add I will leave this question open for ###.   You can attach screenshots of the e-mail or scans of other correspondence to your response.   I wish I had better news.   Thank you.P.S.  You could also have just purchased an inexpensive printer often for less than $20.

Since you have not finished paying the filing fee, you may have a relatively easy out" to let your case be dismissed.  You'll be barred from refiling temporarily but that might be the best option for you right now.I'm not sure what the rush was to file your case or even that it was necessary.   Your student loans are not going away.  Many of the debts are small and you will probably never be sued.  Negative items will drop off your credit history after seven years.   Bankruptcy will stay on your credit for ###. I see only one judgment (### Credit Management which purchased the debt from Synchrony Bank).  No wage garnishment has been issued.  Unfortunately had you hired an attorney you could most likely won that case or forced a dismissal.  Debt buyer cases are relatively easy to defend or settle and even when they actually do have documents related to the debt they are not willing to spend the money to send a live witness to testify. Based on your income you might be or easily become judgment proof.  You show gross income of $### less tax withholding of $###.  This leaves net earnings of $### or $###.15/week net.  The federal minimum wage is $### multiplied by 30 = $###.  So the maximum part of your earnings subject to garnishment would be $###.### ### = $###.  If you are not head of a household then 25% ($###) would be the maximum garnishment amount or if you qualify as head of a household only 10% or $###.  By either increasing your tax withholding and/or slightly reducing your hours you could be totally protected from garnishment.See:  http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=525.030&bid=28062&hl=Looking at the petition and schedules you filed I saw many items which need amendment or correction but it is beyond the scope of this forum to be a substitute for actually having an attorney.However you did NOT list the tax refunds on your property schedule (see attachment).  You also did not claim any tax refunds due to you as exempt property.  I don't know the particular trustee or judge you are dealing with but this needs to be cleaned up ASAP.   Trustees vary from ### to to ###.  (FYI:  Even if you had filed your petition on ### when the documents were signed rather than ### when the case was filed roughly ###/### ###-rated basis).As things now stand you failed to disclose and list the ###.

The vast majority of cases (properly filed) involve no funds available for distribution to creditors -- i.e. "no assets" to distribute.  My apologies if you took any offense - having a "no asset" bankruptcy case means one thing and having "no assets" is something entirely different.  The estimated amount of your tax refunds would have been shown on your property schedule (#28?).I'd be happy to reply further if you can attach the pdf of your petition and schedules and let me know the approximate amount of tax refunds you expect.  Your "wildcard" exemption if not already used up could provide partial exemption of the refunds."43497.8138888889 I am a Pro Se debtor. When I say I have no assets I am not saying I didn't disclose the assets that I currently have to the courts. I have a car, clothes and ect. that was all included on my schedules and the proper exemptions where chosen in order to keep the property. Of course that determination has not been made. But when my case was filed through the courts they showed it as having no assets. I would have loved to had an attorney do the work for me but unfortunately I can't afford the assistance of an attorney so I am trying the best I can to get through this on my own. 43497.8048611111 I am looking to find a little help with a question I have. I am ready to file my taxes but holding out because I don't want to to be seized by the bankruptcy trustee. I filed my case On ###. I have my ###. I have no assets in the case and I have claimed the exemptions. But I don't want the trustee to take my tax return as this is how I live through the year. I pay my healthcare premiums and so forth. I know there might be little I can do but I was going to reach out and see if there was any advice. 43497.7708333333 I have attached the main schedules pertaining to what we are talking about.

If it's $###, and you decide that you want to continue with this Chapter ###, you need to amend your schedules to show the refunds as assets.

This is as far as I can go on this forum.  I still strongly suggest you get some legal advice and determine whether or not you should even try to pursue this case or let it be dismissed.  If you do choose to continue with the case you need to do some amending of your schedules and exemption claims BEFORE the ###.  Best wishes"43497.8777777778 Tax refunds you are owed are property of the bankruptcy estate unless within your exemptions and abandoned by the Chapter ### .  You should have already disclosed possible tax refunds as property on your schedules.  Your lawyer should have explained to you that any refunds could be partially or fully taken to pay creditors.  Your indication that you have no assets" is not correct.  Everyone owns something even if it is just the clothing they are wearing. I'm guessing that perhaps you filed the case pro se?   If so is probably long past time for you to hire an attorney to see what can be done to clean up what you have already done.The trustee is very likely to keep your case open past the ###.  Depending on the size of the refunds and if you have adequate remaining exemption amounts the trustee might abandon the ### interest in the refunds - or order you to turn over the refund checks when received and open the time for creditors to file claims.Unless the trustee has already abandoned the bankruptcy ### interest in the tax refunds do not deposit or direct deposit your refunds.  You do not want to take any prohibited action which would result in a denial of a discharge.I  would suggest:(###)  Do your tax returns immediately in order to determine the exact amount of the refunds involved.(###)  Amend your schedules as necessary to show the amounts and claim what is possible as exempt property if any.This would be best accomplished WITH an attorney who can also advise you if it might be possible to dismiss your case and refile it at a later date. "43497.7902777778 ###,Thanks for posting your question.  I'm glad to try to point you in the right direction.  Unfortunately, the fact that you're receiving SSI does not protect you from being sued and getting a judgment against you.  Nevertheless, if a judgment is obtained against you, your SSI benefits cannot be garnished or seized in satisfaction of that debt.  They are protected from such seizure.  If the creditor obtains a judgment, they can potentially seize garnish other income that you have including seizing property (real estate, cars, boats, etc.) in satisfaction of that Judgment.  In answer to your question, the only way to stop a judgment being placed against you is to settle the lawsuit with the creditor (usually paying them less than is due) and have them dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice, or fight the lawsuit if it is not a valid debt or if you have some other defense.  I'd suggest that you sit down with an attorney to review the lawsuit, discuss the facts, and talk about your options in detail.I hope this helps . . . if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reply to this message.  Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck with this matter.###43501.6006944444 I just recently qualified for SSI and I was also sued by a collection agency.

For example, there is a letter you can send to your creditors informing them that your only source of income is SS - if that's true - and many times, they then figure out that it would not be worth their time to sue you.If you have other debt issues, bankruptcy may be beneficial, but I would not recommend filing bankruptcy for these unsecured credit card debts alone  If you would like me to send you some free information, or you have additional questions, please feel free to call me at ###-###.

Do I need to respond to this summons or do I appear in court?  43507.6541666667 If it is a summons that you received then you must appear in court to defend yourself.  If you do not appear for court then a default judgment will be entered against you and they will then pursue whatever assets you have.  It may be possible to work out a payment plan with these folks due to your circumstances or you may want to consider filing bankruptcy.Another option is to get an attorney.  I recognize that you feel you cannot afford to hire an attorney but it may well be that you cannot afford not to hire an attorney.  Many of these companies pursuing these debts are what we call ### debt collectors.  Basically companies that buy old worthless debt, some of which may not even be valid, for ###Â¢ on the dollar.  These companies seldom have what is necessary to be able to legally support their claims and just rely on folks rolling over any paying them something.  Oftentimes the tactics that they employ violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) so you can actually get them to pay you money via a counterclaim.  Because of the possibility of a FDCPA counterclaim it may be possible to get an attorney to represent you on a contingency basis meaning no out of pocket cost to you.I know that ### ### handles those claims in the St. ### area so I would encourage you to call her to see if she can help.

Frequently if the creditor's attorney is unable to serve you after several attempts, the case will just be dismissed due to lack of service.###.  Please consult with an attorney who handles debt litigation and particularly one who also handles claims under the FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act).   organize all of the documents you have including the records of CRA disputes filed.  Many attorneys will offer free initial consultations.###.  Unfortunately if you initiated disputes online, you might have agreed that any disputes will be arbitrated.

After you review the history of this account and previous disputes, the attorney will be able to advise you of your options, including possible claims under the FDCPA.5.  You may very well have viable defenses to the lawsuit (assuming you are eventually served) that would reduce the creditor's claim.  6  Worst case scenario, if it turns out you have no FDCPA claims and no defenses, any competent attorney should be able to settle this debt for half or less of the amount claimed.

Furthermore, that judgment has now been registered in Missouri for collection purposes and you are now being summoned for a debtor's examination.  Assuming the above is true then you may be able to contest the Illinois court's judgment on the basis that the Illinois court lacked personal jurisdiction over you to be able to enter the judgment. Note I'm not saying that you will be successful in such an argument, just that your ability to contest the underlying judgment now is going to be limited to challenging the issuing court's jurisdiction.  If it lacked jurisdiction then the judgment is not valid and the Missouri court will not enforce it.The problem is that if you did business with this company in Illinois then you likely were subject to the court's personal jurisdiction and the default judgment is going to be valid.  The system is designed to minimize parties being able to contest things multiple times and cause unreasonable expense in litigating matters.  The Missouri court is obligated to honor the Illinois judgment under the US Constitution provided the Illinois court had jurisdiction.  In other words, all of your defenses based upon the problems with the equipment are not going to be available to you since you failed to assert them in the Illinois court when given the opportunity.Additionally, you should have set your business up as an LLC or similar entity so that the leasing contract was with that entity rather than you personally which would have avoided you being personally liable on the matter.I can give you one piece of advice that may be helpful to you.  At the debtor's examination immediately assert your 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.  Do not answer any questions other than your name and keep insisting on asserting your 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination for every question asked no matter how trivial or ### it may seem.  In very short order the court will put a stop to the inquiry and release you with the creditor gaining no useful information.  It is important that you not answer any questions or you could be deemed to have waived your 5th Amendment rights and be ordered to provide answers.  Note I am assuming that you are in Missouri for the debtor's exam as I do not know how this is dealt with in Illinois.  Incidentally, the basis for asserting your 5th Amendment rights is that anything financial could impact on your taxes which could in turn result in criminal prosecution.  You do not have to be presently aware of having committed a crime in order to assert your 5th Amendment rights.  What you want to say each time asked is the following: I refuse to answer on the basis that it may ### me pursuant to the 5th Amendment of the US Constitution.""43509.9083333333 Two years ago I agreed to purchase equipment for my business from a private party in Illinois.

Thank you.43516.7868055556 Ms. ###,This is more of a math question than a legal question, and it almost certainly isn't worth paying an attorney to look over the documents.  A person with good math and reading skills should be all you need.Starting with the assumption that it is extremely likely that ### Financial is acting in accordance with the terms of the loan contract, you should continue making payments on time.   Paying late, but within a grace period during which a late charge is not assessed, is possibly going to counted as making late payments and negatively affect your credit history.  Paying after the due date (and before a late charge) is not making payments on time.If you made an extra" payment this would more likely have reduced your principal balance but not affected your monthly payments.  It's also possible that under the terms of your loan agreement the payment cannot be applied until it is due. If you are able to reply and attach legible scans of the loan documents and other related documents (all the billing statements payment history etc.) I would be glad to take a look for anything irregular.   I may be able to help you understand what has happened. If you do not have a scanner or someone to scan the documents for you then I'd suggest finding a friend or relative with good math and reading skills to review the documents.  It would be far less expensive to have someone with an accounting background involved than an attorney.I'll hold this open for ### or let me know that they will be forthcoming.Thank you."43512.9104166667 Unfortunately I have not received a response, so I am closing this out.

Medical payments coverage is not mandatory, so your mother's policy will only have it if your mother opted for the coverage. If there was another driver involved, it's worth while to make a claim with their insurance company.

The roofing company did a terrible job.  The roof has nails sticking up through the shingles and has two leaks. The roof was not put on according to the contract or the manufacturers instructions, which ### the factory warranty on the shingles.  I refused to pay until the roof was fixed. Instead of fixing the roof the company took me to small claims court. The court ruled that I had presented no financial amount that it would cost to repair the defects and ruled for the Plaintiff.  I would like to know what is involved in filing an appeal and if I should file an appeal of the decision and if I need a lawyer going forward.43521.7326388889 You cannot just tell the judge that the company did a poor job without providing some evidence that the court can rely on to offset what is owed the contractor.  You also have to make a counterclaim for the amount of damages you are asserting as a result of the poor workmanship - again with an amount for damages.  That requires you to have a contractor come and assess what it will take to repair the improperly installed roof shingles, repair any damage caused by the leaks you mentioned, etc.  You will also need to have evidence that the roof was not installed properly and/or that there are leaks.  Some of this can be accomplished with photographs but ultimately you are going to need to have a contractor appear and testify that the roof shingles were not installed in compliance with industry standards and manufacturers recommendations.  That contractor will also be able to testify as to what it will cost to repair the defective installation, etc.  It is important to understand that the law requires that all related claims be presented in the same case together so if you fail to make a counterclaim in this case for you damages you will not be permitted to raise them later on in a different lawsuit.  It is referred to as a ### counterclaim.If you were in small claims court then most likely you are entitled to what is called a Trial De ### which is in effect a do over.  You must file for the Trial De ### within the time required (which I think is ###).  The case will then be transfered to a different Associate Circuit Judge and the case will be set on the trial docket.  When the case is tried again it will be under the normal rules of evidence which are far more strict than what was applied at the Small Claims Court so you will need to have a lawyer assist you or you won't be able to get in any of your evidence.  I believe you should also be permitted to add any counterclaims that you may have when the case is assigned to the new trial court.If for some reason this case is not subject to a Trial De ### then your appeal rights are to the Missouri Court of Appeals which will be much more complicated and requires an attorney.  More importantly, unlike the Trial De ###, a formal appeal is not a do over and you do not get to submit new evidence.  The only thing an appeal to the Court of Appeals will do is look for a legal error made by the judge which it isn't likely to find.I strongly urge you to promptly contact a local attorney to assist you with this matter or you are going to find yourself not only paying for the roof but unable to get any relief for the improperly installed work.43521.8083333333 Also on this form u sent me so I put the original date I filed which was on the ### or do I put todayâ€™s date43524.0118055556 Checking  ###, it does not show you have filed an amended exemption claim.

Do you happen to have anyone to recommend?43528.1597222222 I just want to make sure that I am correctly understanding that you already filed suit, obtained a money judgment against the defendant and are now asking about collection procedures to satisfy the judgment.  Assuming that is the situation then there are basically two methods available.  The first is garnishment and the second is execution. If the defendant was employed in a traditional job then garnishment would be the most practical approach.  Essentially a garnishment is an order from the court directing any person or entity with funds belonging to the debtor to pay those funds over to the judgment creditor.  Since this person is not so employed it become much more difficult.  Instead you will need to file a garnishment against the person's bank account but for that you must know which bank the person uses.  For that you can hire a Private Investigator or other entity to perform a financial search.  Another option is to execute on a known asset.  I once had a sheriff execute (seize) a debtor's truck that he used in his business which promptly resulted in him coming up with the money owed.  The problem is that collecting on a judgment is often much more difficult than getting the judgment to begin with.  You may want to consider contacting a collection attorney to handle this for you on a contingency basis.  I think that many do so for ###5% of the amount recovered.  While $### $###,###.  100% of $### very much. 43525.9375 No I donâ€™t.

You probably should not even be discussing it with the hospital or insurance company without an attorney.  Certainly do not sign or agree to anything.

On a follow up call, the rep on the case even admitted that the expectation was for the charge off and ### to be given to me.Do they not have to honor this agreement or is there something I can do now to make them honor it so that I can go back to making payments again?43536.6173611111 So what is your question? You presented a lot of facts but never said what it was that you wanted to know. 43536.2326388889 This all took place ######.43535.8895833333 When you failed to make payments as required under the loan contract the acceleration clause kicks in and allows the lender to insist on full payment of the balance.What you have to understand is that a promise is not a binding agreement that can be enforced.  For it to be enforceable it must have all of the ingredients of a contract which included consideration from both sides.  Consideration is the payment or giving of something to the other side OR the giving up of something against the other side that could be asserted.  Your original loan agreement is an enforceable contract because both sides provided consideration - you promised to make payments including some amount of interest and the lender agreed to lend money to permit you to buy a vehicle. These hardship agreements or deferments only involve you getting a more favorable treatment than you originally agreed to without giving the lender anything in return (other than the payments which you were already obligated to make under the original contract).  So unless there was some additional consideration on your part I'm not sure how the agreements" you mention can be enforced.  Even if they were enforceable your post doesn't quote them as committing to getting reverse the charge off but rather the person would "push [for the charge off] to be reversed."  You do not indicate whether or not you followed up with the Office of the President to confirm that the charge off went through so I do not know if there was any confirmation by the lender that it was reversing the charge off.Essentially you did try to communicate with the lender on multiple occasions about your situation but you also failed to make payments for ###'t make a payment as you indicated you would following the ### phone call.  A loan that is over ###'t going to pay.  In addition you didn't address the issue with the lender for ### 11/### ###.  Under those circumstances a lender is going to be very reluctant to assist a debtor as they do not perceive that the debtor is serious about dealing with their legal obligation.That said having made the ###.  I am not sure what you are referring to when you say that you were offered to make larger monthly payments as an option.  With you having been so late in making payments the interest and late charges incurred may well be all that they are charging you in those higher monthly payments.  In other words it may just reflect the additional amount that you owed as a result of ### making the normal payments as and when due.  I suppose it might also reflect a higher interest rate based upon your failure to make the payments when due reflecting the consideration necessary to make the agreement enforceable.  Obviously I cannot assess what has happened without more specifics regarding the ###ure of the new larger monthly payments.You might try reaching out to the Office of the President again to get clarification and possible assistance."43536.8368055556 I was served a wage garnishment order on ### for a defaulted auto loan for the amount of $### ( I think it was a ###'t believe the loan was that much) over the preceding years I was in  and out of employment and the order was stopped and started a couple of times.I was served with that same  wage garnishment order on ### for amount of $###.I really just want to know if  that order is still bending, if not how do I stop it ....if it is valid what can I do to get it reduced or challenge facts of the original loan amount.Thank you###43536.1930555556 I'm at work now I'll send a better attachment later43536.5833333333 Mr. Brown,I will try to answer your questions, but it would be helpful if you would provide a copy of the garnishment paperwork and the case number.43536.3416666667 Server" should have been "service" in the 3rd paragraph above."43540.6423611111 Thank youhere is a ### photo photos will that work?43536.5819444444 Unfortunately it appears that there are many garnishments over the years.  See attachments.  Judgments are presumed paid after ###, unless the judgment is revived through a court process or revived by a payment of record.  Every time garnishment funds were received through the court the judgment is revived for ###.  Looking at the history of garnishment payments, it appears the judgment never has become presumed paid" under the ### statute.Judgments in Missouri (other than child support) earn 9% annual interest.  If stated in the judgment (which I cannot view online) the contract rate of interest may apply rather than the statutory 9% rate.You would need to hire an attorney to actually review the court file.  I can only view the docket entries and recent documents from the file.  The only possible issue which might be raised is that it looks like the creditor's attorney requested another summons after you were served.  This might legally have abandoned the previous server.  I cannot tell if the docket entries viewable on ### are correct or not.  Although it is an extreme ### it might still be possible to raise this issue now alleging the original default judgment is void.  You would need to hire an attorney to review the court file in its entirety and see if this or any other issue might still be raised.However unless you are successful in challenging the default judgment on a legal basis your other option would be bankruptcy.  You cannot now challenge the amount of the original judgment.  If the interest calculation made by the creditor's attorney is in error in some manner the interest calculation could be challenged.  However it may well be correct.  Your failure to pay the judgment resulted in a huge amount of interest accruing.  The interest which has accrued is far more than the amount of the original judgment.I would suggest that you explore the possible service abandonment issue with an attorney and/or consult with an attorney for a possible bankruptcy filing.  If you are in a position to offer a significant lump sum as settlement of the remaining amount still due under the judgment your lawyer might be able to try to resolve the debt with the creditor's attorney.Best wishes."43539.4972222222 DUPLICATE QUESTION.43536.5215277778 I was served a wage garnishment order for a car loan on ###for the amount of $### ( i think that was more than the loan on a ###)However over the preceding years i was in and out of employment so the order was never  satisfied.I recieved the same order on ### for the amount of $###I want to know if this order is still bending ...if not how do I stop it .... and if it is still valid is it possable to have it reduced.Thank you###I'll send a copy later43536.1791666667 I bought the car from a used car dealer and u had the car less than a week and it went out on me on the highway.

You should never consider buying a used automobile without first having it checked out by an auto mechanic that you trust.  Absent some sort of warranty there is no legal basis to hold the seller liable aside from suing for fraudulent misrepresentation which is going to be a very hard sell as it is his word against yours.  I would just follow up with the seller and see where things are in regard to getting it fixed and returned to you.

I know of no legal basis for forcing the issuance of license plates or tags in the absence of you paying your personal property tax. I think you should also know that any division of debts ordered by the court in your divorce decree has no legal bearing on anyone else so you arenâ€™t likely to get the County to say you only owe half of any of these amounts since legally you owe the entire amount but may have the right to pursue your ex-husband for all or a portion.The IRS and the Missouri DOR regularly have to deal with situations in which individuals and businesses owe significant amounts that cannot reasonably be paid off immediately. Consequently they have standard procedures for making payment arrangements but property tax collections should never get to the point that such steps are required. That is why you are finding the difference between it and the IRS and DOR. 43540.7347222222 I have attached a copy of an email I sent to several departments of yours back in January I have gone back-and-forth back-and-forth and about ### ###'t help me which they won on the phone told me so I wasted time and gas at the courthouse.I would appreciate my message being sent to someone higher up to see if someone can make some kind of arrangement for me to get even temporary tags or something for my Jeep so that I can continue to go back-and-forth to work and not be in fear of getting my Jeep towed and not being able to go to work at all.I had arranged to get a loan for half of the balance due which is my rightful share as my ex should pay the other half and they would not accept it.

A body attachment is not applicable to either case so no you can't do that.  If you are talking about removing the individual from the premises after having obtained a judgment for possession then the answer is that you have to contact the sheriff's department to arrange for them to come out and remove the individual from the premises.  You will need to make sure that the judgment is final before contacting the sheriff's department.If you are asking about collecting a money judgment then the answer is that you must locate some assets that the judgment debtor has and execute on it or locate a source of funds to which the judgment debtor is entitled and file a garnishment.  If you know where the person works you can file a garnishment on their wages.  If you know where the person banks you can file a garnishment on the person's bank accounts.  If you know that the person has a truck registered in his name (assuming it is worth something) you can ask the court to execute on the truck.  The reality is that obtaining a judgment on folks such as this is generally the easy part - getting the judgment satisfied is the hard part.43562.89375 won a judgement on a unlawful detainer. defendant has not paided a dime of the judgement can I have a body attachment issued. since he has done nothing that was ordered by the courts of ### co. mo.43562.0020833333 I was wondering what could be done if your car was ### without notice? or any kind of wait period. i purchased said car on ###/### ###/###. i read that missouri has a law about this. what can i do? i did go in and pay to get the car back but now im out even more money. stressed and lost on how to make up this loss43563.8486111111 I you believe that your car was illegally ### then you can either sue on your own or hire and attorney to do so.

Bankruptcy attorney fees can vary wildly from attorney to attorney, and it's also dependent on the type of bankruptcy you're filing.  I'd suggest that you find several local bankruptcy attorneys and simply call them to find out what their charges are.  There are some people who try to file on their own.  Since it looks like you live in the St. ### area, you'd file bankruptcy in the Eastern District of Missouri federal court.  Please see this site and the links on that page for filing bankruptcy without an attorney: ###It is ALWAYS advantageous to have an attorney represent you as there are numerous pitfalls in representing yourself.

There is very little that you can do at this point other than assert any exemptions that you might be entitled to. I suppose you could file a motion to quash the garnishment and present evidence that all of the funds in the account are yours and none are his. Generally that wonâ€™t cut it from a legal standpoint but the court could grant the relief by exercising its equitable legal powers. You need to open a new bank account without your sonâ€™s name on it and direct all future payments to the new account. To have the money go to your son upon your death you merely add your son as ### (transfer on death).

The default position on a used car sale is that it is an as is" sale.  Did the vehicle come with a written warranty?  If so you would have the rights described in the warranty.  If there was a ### defect present when you purchased the vehicle the mechanic you hired to do a ### inspection might be liable.  (I don't know if you in fact hired a mechanic to check out the vehicle as most prudent people do before buying used cars).  I also don't know if you obtained a CarFax report or if the car lot provided one.Your question ("I'm really just interested in knowing how did my car past safety and if the breaks were malfunctioning.") isn't something an attorney can answer.  You might wish to discuss this with the place where you took the vehicle for the state inspection.  However most likely the response will be that the vehicle passed the specific items in the state inspection and the brake problem was not apparent at the time.  The items covered in a state safety inspection are not comprehensive like a buyer's mechanic's inspection.If the brake problem occurred during the initial warranty period and you have not been able to get the problem diagnosed and fixed by the ### it would be time to take the vehicle to a genuine dealer for a proper diagnosis and repair estimate.The make model year and mileage?

This may require you to enlist financial assistance from family, friends, co-workers, etc. to raise the funds needed to pay for a bankruptcy.  Simply the size of this debt makes it unlikely it will ever be paid off through garnishments.  The judgment carries a 19% annual interest rate.But if there is a service issue with the revival of the judgment, you may have an easier option.  Attached is the return of service, which shows service on a relative.  If this was not your place of residence at the time (and you can prove it), it may be possible to get the revival set aside.  You need to hire a lawyer for advice and representation.As far as the exemption claim goes, the Civil Rule is here;  ###You were supposed to file your verified exemption claim within ###.  i don't know when you were served with notice of the garnishment, but you might still be able to get the court to permit a late filing for good cause.  But you need an attorney to draft and file a motion and proper exemption claim.  However even if you are able to get the percentage reduced to 10% of net earnings after required tax deductions, this is not a solution to your problem. I suggest that you find a way to retain counsel to try to undo the revival (if possible) or to file bankruptcy.

If you closed your account at the first location and the roommate opened his or her account for the utilities, the roommate's unpaid ### would not be transferred to your new residence account.  You would have had a final ### shortly after you terminated the utilities at the first house.  So either you did not successfully close the utility account or ### City Utilities erroneously transferred more than your final ### to your new account.  If the ###s were estimated, a final reading could have also resulted in a large unpaid ###. When you contacted City Utilities customer support to discuss the transferred ###, what was the explanation?  If you are responsible for the transferred amount, and it was not an error, you may need to sue your ex-roommate in small claims court.Please provide additional information so I can respond further.  Thank you.43601.2361111111 I entered into a relationship in the beginning of 2015, which would later end after being used and taken full advantage of financially. I was left in a huge financially bind. I am still currently trying to dig out from it (has been over ###). I was persuaded to trade my Chevy ### (had paid off) in for a used ### ### he wanted. I was made to believe this was both of our truck. He also had many modifications done on the truck, 95% done with my money. I was only allowed" to drive it once in awhile the first month. Was then told it is "his truck" but I made about ###. Now the reason I ended up on the loan and title in the first place is because he could not get approved without me. Yes should have been a red flag. On the title it is listed my name "and" his name. So what has lead me to this moment in time and my ###...Once the money ran out so did he. He left me with so much debt it would make your head spin. I removed him from my insurance which he was using all my discounts to get a much cheaper premium. He made it very clear to me that was "his truck" and he would make the payments and was mad that he would now have to keep up the insurance. I found out that he is consistently late on the payments or really behind to begin collections. For ### (the truck) and raised the truck payment both times. He is again behind and no insurance. I am a single mother of two still digging out from bills he helped create but left me with. The bank said I could refinance it and get his name off and take it from him but not sure I can get a loan at this time (thanks to him). I have also been told I have the right to go get it from him because we own the truck equally. I would love to do this but he can then come and take it back from me. I am worried something is going to happen with no insurance or the truck will go back and I will get stuck with a garnishment. Is there ANYTHING that can be done legally???? Force a sale (did try to get him to that when he first left). Convince the bank to repo it and let me clean it up to sell? HELP?!?!?!? I apologize if I said too much unnecessary things but needed to lay it out there what lead up to this and the position I am in. There is so much more that can be told I just touched on the tip.Photos attached are just a few of many"43593.1270833333 Sorry you are in this situation. Unfortunately it is going to be complicated to undo. Your best bet is to contact the bank and negotiate with them to surrender the vehicle to satisfy the debt, and to negotiate a payment plan for any remainder owed. However, a surrender could be complicated if your ex refuses to surrender possession. Because you are also named on the loan, you will be responsible personally for the entirety of all amounts owed on the loan. If your ex refuses to surrender the vehicle, you will have to retain an attorney to remove him from the title and repossess the vehicle. Depending on your financial situation you may be able to qualify for a free attorney with Legal Services of Missouri. Once you have removed your ex from the title and regained possession, you will be in a position to negotiate with the bank. Best of luck to you.43616.8208333333 I have been sued by a debt collector on a past due credit card balance. I have not yet been served but I am aware of the court date.I have been calling them fairly frequently for a few months trying to set up a settlement and we were not able to come to an agreement.I eventually agreed to begin payments of 98$ a month, officially for the full amount but with the understanding that I could attempt to negotiate a settlement later. I told them I would need a written letter stating terms before I would begin payments.I'm not sure of some the terms in this letter and it looks like they will have it signed by a judge.Question ###: will this preclude me from even attempting to settle a lump sum lower than the amount listed?Question ###: The letter says I am waiving my right to being served and I'm not sure if that is something I should agree to.Question ###: If I sign and agree, what kind of possible ramifications am I looking at if I cannot follow through?43593.7944444444 In that case you need to decide how you are going to deal with the debt. If you have other debts you should strongly consider speaking with a bankruptcy attorney to eliminate all of these debts and get a fresh start. Contrary to the public perception it wonâ€™t impact your credit for as long as you think. 43593.9111111111 Thank You for your reply,I am confident this is not ### debt. The card was active less than a year ago and we only had to stop payments and got behind around August of last year.43593.86875 What you are being asked to sign is a consent judgment which means that you are agreeing to have judgment entered against you for the full amount of the debt.  Signing this will not preclude you from being able to negotiate a settlement for a lesser lump sum amount but it may make it less likely.  Waiving service isn't necessarily a big deal as you are liable for the court costs which will include the expense of getting you served.  If you sign the consent judgment and fail to make any payments they will immediately be able to proceed in satisfying the full amount outstanding.  They will be able to do so by filing garnishments against your employer and against your bank accounts.  They will also be able to execute on any assets that you have such a your truck or car.If you owe the money you are going to have to address it in some fashion one way or another.  If you can handle these payments then it is fine to proceed so long as you understand that you will be making monthly payments for the next ###.  You may want to consider filing bankruptcy, particularly if you have other debts, to get rid of all of them and make a clean start.Incidentally, is this a recent debt that you knew was needing to be paid or is this something that has been around for a long time?  The reason I ask is that there are debt collectors that buy up old debts for literally pennies on the dollar and try to strong arm folks into paying them.  In most cases these folks can't actually make a proper case in court.  Furthermore, they often are violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).  If that is the case you can hire an attorney to represent you without any out of pocket expense as the attorney gets paid a contingency fee out of the amounts that the creditor has to pay for violating the FDCPA.  We commonly refer to these as ### debt cases.43593.8243055556 A creditor has no obligation to accept a payment plan. Since the creditor has an active garnishment there is little incentive to release it in exchange for a promise to pay via payment plan since you failed to honor the loan agreement. You donâ€™t have much chance of stopping the garnishment based on you not being served either. The reason being that in order to get the judgment set aside you must have a meritorious defense to the suit. From your post it sounds like you donâ€™t dispute owing the money so no meritorious defense. One thing you could pursue is the impropriety of garnishing a checking account owned by both you and your wife (assuming that is true).  Married couples are deemed to own things as tenants by the entirety which is a unique ownership that cannot be attached absent a judgment against both husband and wife. If the judgment is only against you and the checking account is in both of your names then the garnishment is improper. 43594.54375 I have a garnishment against my checking account due to an unpaid payday loan. I called the collection agency and they refused to setup a payment plan to avoid said garnishment. The collection agency in question is ### ###, LLP and they will not cooperate in any manner. Each time I call them, they tell me they'll accept payments, but won't stop the garnishment or allow for a payment plan. My case number was ### - ###. I didn't even receive the summons for the case in question. They say that it was given to my wife, but she wasn't even in state when the paperwork was served.Do I have any recourse? 43594.4409722222 Thank you. 43594.6125 I will follow up on this tomorrow. 43601.2104166667 Ms. ###,Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.From what you have written, it will not matter if the creditor obtains a default judgment against you or not.  I am always reluctant to tell anyone they are 'judgment-proof or ### without an actual in-person consultation.  But if you are not employed have only social security income and own no real estate or significant personal property from which a judgment could be collected there is no apparent reason to do anything about the lawsuit.If you do not appear at court on ###th a default judgment will be entered against you.  However based on what you have told me there is no way this judgment can be collected.  There does not seem to be any reason for you to even bother to go to court. After the judgment is entered if the creditor is aware of where you bank account is located a garnishment can be issued to the bank.  Because your social security is direct deposited the bank should automatically know the account is protected (exempt) from garnishment.  But occasionally the status of the account will be overlooked so it is always a good idea to also file a claim of exemption with the court stating that the account contains protected social security funds.  You should receive a form and instructions with your copy of the garnishment paperwork.  IF an execution and garnishment is served upon your bank and you're not sure what to do you can repost a question on this forum or consult a local attorney.Your bank probably will charge your account a fee for responding to the garnishment usually about $75.  You might be able to get them to waive this fee if there is a garnishment in the future.You can monitor your case online via ###.  https://www.courts.mo.gov/casenet/base/welcome.doAlthough it's not very likely it is possible you could be served with papers after the judgment for an "Examination of Judgment Debtor."  This is a process by which a creditor holding a judgment can compel you to come to court to answer questions under oath about your assets and income.  Do not ignore this if it happens.  In your situation there's no reason not to testify in court.  You also have the absolute right to "take the fifth" and refuse to give an information.  You should confer with an attorney if your situation has changed and you plan to invoke your fifth amendment rights.  Again you're not likely to receive an examination of judgment debtor order.  But just in case I thought I should mention it.  Unfortunately some people ignore this procedure and end up being picked up and held due to the failure to appear for the examination of judgment debtor in court.Best wishes."43604.7909722222 My only income is Social Security.

I have nothing for them to take.43594.9833333333 Your social security funds are protected from garnishment, but the fact that you receive social security has nothing to do with whether or not a judgment can be entered against you.  Being a social security recipient is not a defense to the lawsuit, which is being brought by a debt buyer.  ### is a debt purchaser, which buys delinquent accounts for ### on the dollar.Filing something with the court showing you receive social security or coming to court with documents to show you receive social security is not helpful.  Most lawsuits brought by debt buyers can be ### by any competent attorney, as it is usually difficult or impossible to prove up the actual debt at trial.  Debt buyers will not usually not even try to send a witness for a trial.  It isn't worth the cost, particularly for a debt which cannot be collected.  But you need an attorney if you want to defend the lawsuit.If your social security is direct deposited, your bank should automatically have it flagged as exempt (protected) from garnishment.  However this system is imperfect, and if a judgment is entered against you and the creditor later garnishes your bank account you must be alert to file a claim of exemptions.  After a judgment is entered against you, if you are served with an examination of judgment debtor youThis is a lawsuit for roughly $2000.  The real question is whether or not you own other assets from which the debt can be collected after a judgment.  If you own a house or other real estate, the judgment could become a lien on the property.  A consultation with an attorney would be worth it to determine if there is any reason to hire an attorney to defend the lawsuit or if you are judgment proof" -- or ###."43594.9145833333 I have been sued by Citizens Bank over a student loan from 2008.  I have consulted with two attorneys.  One believes the statute of limitations has passed, one does not.  The promissory note states that payments were to begin ###.

I note that you also posted about your insurance company which I responded to.  If your vehicle was damaged in the MVA you should look to Farm Bureau to cover the repair and towing expenses.  They will normally take care of that for you unless you don't have collision coverage.  The longer that you leave your vehicle at the tow lot the more it will cost to get it out as they charge a considerable amount per day on top of the significant towing charge.  I ended up turning over my title to them several years ago under similar circumstances (although my car just broke down and was towed so I couldn't rely on my collision coverage to help).43602.8048611111 Thank you once again for your time and consideration in this matter.

I hope to hear from you soon.43599.8597222222 I'm guessing that you feel your insurer should have performed its own investigation and should have concluded that you were not responsible for the motor vehicle accident (MVA).  I can appreciate your frustration but you have no means of forcing the carrier to do anything in regard to its investigation.  Typically the only investigation done is to obtain the police report and take statements from each driver.  The police report is normally considered a strong piece of evidence as it is from a disinterested person.Technically I suppose you could sue the other driver and get a decision at trial that supports your contention that you were not at fault since Missouri is a pure comparative fault state you will be found at least partly at fault which would support your carrier raising your rates so you won't have accomplished much.43602.7986111111 Can you provide me a list of possible attorney's that do focus on this?

I have not received anything in the mail from them and they have my ### at over $###,###. Iâ€™m at a complete loss and have no idea how Iâ€™m supposed to fix this without an attorneys help. I donâ€™t feel that I should have to pay them this amount as that they gave me false information and led me into this mess.43602.6111111111 I think it all boils down to what your contract says in writing, and it likely says that you owe the $### you agreed to pay. It now sounds like you paid ### payment in December and are due for December through present day, which is probably in excess of $###. You usually pay for your insurance ###, so your default in the monthly payments may not necessarily mean youâ€™re currently uninsured, but once your insurance card expires you will be. I would recommend finding a different carrier if you are unhappy with your current company.43623.6361111111 ###,Thanks for posting your question, but I think you've left a lot out of your description.  What does the credit union have to do with the accident?  Did the credit union give you a loan on the car?  Are you behind in payments?  Were you sued?

It does not sound like you have actually been sued yet.Your driver's license can be suspended for failure to maintain insurance so you were correctly told to see an attorney.

There may be a problem with the address the creditor has for you, or perhaps you did not pick up certified mail?  Regardless, I would be concerned that you may not receive the notice of sale.Have you contacted the car creditor?  What did they say about the notice(s)?   You should have the right to pay off the debt plus ### fees, and should do so promptly so you can retrieve your car.There is generally a ### between repossession and sale, so it is not unusual for you to have not yet received the sale notice.

I am only ###. I am also not educated really on how to handle this situation. My family does not have the money to really help me at all the down payment is the vehicle was The last money I had saved but so I wouldnâ€™t spend it I left it to my grandparents to hold onto.

Thank you.43614.6555555556 I'm not sure about the reference to hostility, but absolutely none was intended.  The bottom line is still your contract.  Unless there is some language which specifically permits you to return the car and undo the deal, there is no such right.  Let me know if you have any other questions or if this isn't clear.  Again, sorry for any perceived hostility.  Thank you.43610.0118055556 Mr. ###,It's very difficult to understand what you wrote, in part because of the lack of ### and ### sentences ### with what appear to be many ###.In any event, your question appears to involve this:...was told that you can return a car  for the ###. I am trying to narrow down where this all came from and would personally like to start over with a different dealership somewhere that is reputable and I donâ€™t know  I donâ€™t know if I can get my down payment back and return their vehicle on harmed nothing wrong with it."I don't know why you would think you have any right to return a used car after purchase.  Unless there is some specific language in the sales contract which gives you that right you cannot return it.  It would be very unusual for such a return clause to be in a sales contract.  You should have carefully read the contract before signing it and if you did not now would be a good time to make sure you understand exactly what you signed.  Used car purchases are "as is" by default.  Apparently there are no issues with the vehicle itself but you should never purchase a used vehicle without having an independent mechanic's inspection and a historical report like CarFax.  You may have a limited warranty of (for example) ###  for covered repairs but this does not permit you to undo the sale and return the vehicle.  Again you need to read your contract.  "Buyers remorse" or changing your mind is not a basis to undo a binding contract.So unless there is something in your contract which gives you the right to undo the sale the car is yours.  You need to pay the sales tax (if not already done) register the title purchase insurance (if not already done) and obtain license plates. If there is something I have misunderstood or confused please let me know.  Thank you."43609.8986111111 Yes there is a big misunderstanding. I am sorry I had to get an apple phone for security.

If the ownership is tenants in common then they wonâ€™t likely foreclose on the property as they are only entitled to whatever ownership you have. They will place a lien on the property and the amount of the debt will continue to grow at the legal rate of 9% or whatever interest rate the agreement provided for. As a consequence, you canâ€™t simply ignore the debt as it will continue to grow until it is more than the value of the home. You should speak with a bankruptcy attorney since that appears to be your only option at this point based upon your assertion that you have no defense to the debt. Alternatively you can work out a payment arrangement but you will have to abide by it. 43613.5833333333 Iâ€™m not sure what you mean by safe.

The Missouri Bar does have an attorney search function here:  ###However I doubt you will have much success finding a bankruptcy attorney at low or minimal cost.  I also doubt the attorney who quoted at $### ###.  Normally you will need to pay the attorney the full attorney's fees, filing fee and credit counseling fees before a case will be filed.  In the St. ### area that would be generally between $### $###. If you have tax issues you should not be considering attempting to represent yourself.  While certain tax obligations are sometimes able to be discharged, a careful analysis of the tax history, filing dates and time frames is necessary.  Many attorneys have a separate tax analysis done by a specialist as part of normal Chapter ###.Student loans are almost never dischargeable, except in rare cases of extreme hardship.  Attempting to seek discharge of student loans involves an additional lawsuit within the bankruptcy case (an adversary proceeding).  It is a complicated process and almost never successful.And while it is sometimes possible to pay the court's initial filing fee in installments, it is asking for trouble.  Most attorneys recommend against it, as any default in the payments can result in a dismissal of your Chapter ###.You really need to have a good bankruptcy attorney analyze your income and debt situation in depth, review the pros and cons of filing under Chapter ### 13, and explain your options in detail.I would caution you against attempting to file your own bankruptcy case, as most people lack the knowledge and training to do so successfully.  I realize you have indicated you are in a financially difficult situation, but you could make it worse by attempting to represent yourself.  Perhaps you could obtain financial help from family or friends or by the sale of some assets?

If you plan to attempt to try to represent yourself and act as your own attorney, you will need to draft your own pleadings.  Hiring an attorney for limited scope representation may be another option for you: http://missourilawyershelp.org/hiring-a-lawyer-for-limited-scope-representation/Filing fees vary from county to county, so you would need to check with the Clerk of the Circuit Court in ### County for the filing fee schedule.If you are able to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the car was stolen and that it was damaged as a result of the negligence of your ex-girlfriend, you would likely have a viable claim.  However apparently this happened almost a year and a half ago, so you should make sure to have a copy of the police report you made at the time.  Your damages will generally be capped at the private party NADA blue book value of the vehicle at the time of the loss.  If this is close to the small claims limitation, you may wish to consider filing a small claims case. However if the value of the vehicle was in fact $###, you would be well-advised to retain an attorney for advice and representation.Best wishes.43619.9944444444 I have loans with Federal Student Loan Servicing. They have taken multiple payments from my bank account that they say they have not received. My bank has confirmed that these payments were taken out but Fed Loan is denying it. I have tried to call the Ombudsman to no avail. I am having money stolen from my bank account with no recourse. I don't know if it would be worth it to hire a lawyer? I am not sure how to protect my finances and self from this loan servicer. 43619.8069444444 Sounds bad.  Yes, hire an attorney if you can afford one and if the amount wrongfully taken is significant. 43620.0965277778 Thank you, how much would I be looking at in legal fees for my defense? Low income currently due to overcoming challenges of the termination.43620.8638888889 That would depend on what all was involved and the attorneyâ€™s rates. Contact a local business lawyer with trial experience and discuss it with them. Depending upon your circumstances you may consider simply contacting a bankruptcy attorney. 43620.9069444444 The documents don't need to be notarized so that has no bearing on anything.What is troubling is the characterization of this as a straight out loan when the other document doesn't appear to support that.  Quite frankly that second document is rather vague and unclear as to what it is and it arguably could be asserted that it is just an agreement outlining how you are going to repay the $10k that you already owe them.  If I were you I would insist on them producing evidence of you having received the $10k which they contend you were loaned.  If it is in fact a situation where they were supposed to provide you with leads and you signed the agreement in mid December and were discharged just over a month later it is hard to see how they could have provided you with $10k worth of leads in that timeframe.  In that event I would press for them to produce evidence of the supposed leads.The problem that you are going to have is that unless you have an attorney represent you it is likely you won't be able to get any of your evidence in at the trial of the case due to you not understanding the evidentiary rules.  I still recall the case that I handled for a client ###.  Missouri does not provide for an appeal from small claims but rather a trial de ### (basically a do over in associate circuit court).  Since the evidentiary rules that are relaxed in small claims are actually enforced in associate circuit the poor girl could not understand why she could not get any of her evidence introduced into the case.  Every time she tried to introduce one of her documents I objected for lack of foundation and it was sustained.  She just stood there looking dumbfounded.  Eventually the judge started to feel bad for her and started to overrule my objections but it was already over and she lost the case.I don't mention this to discourage you but rather to let you know up front that handling this yourself when the other side is represented by an accomplished trial firm is only going to end in disaster for you.43620.8583333333 The petitioner is stating that I owe them $10,###, ### Does it matter that the contract was not notarized in the state of KY or MO? The contract states that the cost was for leads, ### was a free lead platform, therefore there was no cost to the leads, I have no invoices provided by ### for such leads. The contract states the payment would be made by my paid as earned commissions with Pioneer American Insurance Company, however, I was wrongfully terminated on ###, before the paid as earned ommissions were able to begin paying back the loan. There are paid as earned statements by Pioneer American Insurance Company that I'm not vested in because of a 3-year vested contract with ### Insurance Advisors. With the contract stating, invoices must be resolved with ### Insurance Advisors and not Pioneer American Insurance Company does not indemnify Pioneer American Insurance Company to provide the court with my paid as earned statements, does it?43620.6743055556 I recently received notice from my insurance company that I am at fault for an accident. I was driving my Uncle's truck to the store, and I pulled out of the parking lot. I heard a bang behind me, and realized that another driver had driven into a ### thought I had been hit, but I had no damage to my vehicle.She states that I pulled out in front of her, and to avoid the accident she (instead of slowing ### was speeding at the time) ran full speed into a curb. They say because she tried to avoid the accident, I'm at fault because I failed to yield and was not looking out. But there was no ### never hit my vehicle! She stated at the time that she was late to collect her child from school, and definitely seemed ###. I don't think I pulled out in front of ### think she wasn't paying attention, saw a large red truck, and decided to pull into a curb instead of slowing down to avoid an accident she THOUGHT was happening. At what point does she have to take some responsibility for her own actions. I can understand if she hit my vehicle (meaning I pulled out RIGHT in front of her so she couldn't avoid hitting me), but she's basically using me as an excuse for why she drove her vehicle into a curb.I could say a vehicle ###, so I drove into a curb to avoid the accident that I thought was going to ### not paying enough attention, and being scared an accident might happen, doesn't mean that an accident actually WILL happen. The insurance adjuster spoke to me in August, and NONE of what I said was in the report at all except 'pulled out of the parking lot.' They're saying I crossed 'several lanes of traffic,' like I just forced myself across a highway. None of this is what happened! The insurance company said I was not included or excluded on the policy at the time, so they rejected the Claim.Missouri is a no-fault state, though, and ultimately they accepted Liability for the accident. I think that, ultimately, they accepted liability for something that they never should have, and they're now trying to come after me for the amount. Is there anything I can do at this point? 43620.7680555556 Tough situation.  If the insurance company sued you for subrogation, and it likely will, then you need to defend the case, just like any vehicle collision case.  That means either hiring an attorney or trying to navigate the court system on your own. I hope things work out for you. 43626.5416666667 I recently recieved a letter from the ### county circuit court stating that my garnishment has been terminated by the court due to supreme court rule 90.19(b) (c)  My employer has continued to take the garnishment from my check because they have not recieved a release form. How do I go about obtaining a release form?43620.8194444444 Thank you for answering my question! 43621.6097222222 Your employer (garnishee) would have received the same order from the court which was sent to you:Statement of Judgment Balance Remaining Due was not timely filed on garnishment ####.

Any objection to the disbursement must be filed with the Court before the disbursement. The late or untimely filing of a statement of judgment balance remaining due will not revive or reinstate a writ of garnishment. See Local Rule ###""I would suggest you discuss this again with your employer as no release from is appropriate or required.  The court order terminated the garnishment.  Any funds your employer had already withheld and not ### should have been sent in.  If you cannot get your employer to understand the court's order you may need to see an attorney. You and your employer can also see the docket entries for the case on ###:  https://www.courts.mo.gov/casenet/base/welcome.doHowever the plaintiff has filed an updated statement of what you still owe (copy attached) and another continuous garnishment will be coming soon.  The original default judgment carries an interest rate of 16% per annum (copy also attached).  All you are paying so far is interest on the judgment and you are not making any progress in paying down the debt.  At this rate you will never pay it off.  You need to figure out your future plans to deal with this and any possible other indebtedness you have.I would suggest you consider consulting with a bankruptcy attorney or develop a plan to pay this off sooner than just through garnishments.  If you have access to loans at substantially less than 16% this would also help you pay this off much sooner.  The creditor might also consider a lump sum settlement for substantially less than the full balance you owe.  Best wishes."43620.8659722222 Any other money from any source. Refunds from something you bought. A check from a friend for something. Literally any other funds.

If you refinanced the house into your name, assuming a mortgage in your name that has gone unpaid, then youâ€™re correct - nonpayment will hurt your credit and yes, youâ€™ll be liable for the mortgage if the property is foreclosed and thereâ€™s a deficiency balance. But...if the mortgage is still in Moms name, meaning you never refinanced the loan into your own name, then there shouldnâ€™t be any effect on your credit. Your credit is tied to your social security number, not your address.If no probate estate has been opened, the time period has passed for a creditor to force open an estate, plus youâ€™ve seen first hand exactly how interested the mortgage company is in collecting on their loan. Unfortunately a $### mortgage isnâ€™t a spec in the universe of the mortgage lender. Thereâ€™s no law requiring them to foreclose. Typically what happens in these situations is that you have to wait. If the taxes on the property remain unpaid for ###, the county will sell the property in year ###. Your problems will be further complicated if the lender is paying the taxes on the property. A county tax sale is going to be your best bet at washing your hands of the entire thing. Iâ€™d recommend calling the county to find out when the last time anybody paid the taxes on the house and then sit around waiting for it to sell.43637.6298611111 My brother and I are wanting to know if thereâ€™s any way that we can get out of financial liability for a mortgage for a home that was owned by our mother up until she died from terminal cancer on 2012 â€“ my brother was ### ###. I do not remember if she had a living will, but probably a month or so prior to her passing, she had filed a beneficiary deed naming my brother and I as joint tenants with rights of survivorship with the court of records.After her death, we lived in the house for awhile while we processed her death and then prepared to move out with the hope that we could sell the home, though it was a cheap home in need of some major repairs at the time. I had been making payments on the home prior to her death and continued after while we were in the home. During this time, we met a neighbor whose daughter and her family were poor and needed an affordable place to stay but seemed interested in the house despite all its problems, so we ended up letting them move in on the plan that they would pay for the mortgage and eventually take over ownership once the mortgage was paid. They followed this plan and paid for about a half of a year before they eventually stopped paying. During this time my brother had joined the military and I had moved to ### to start school.Several years passed of them remaining in the house, during which no payments have been made on the mortgage, and though itâ€™s been years since a payment has been made, the loan servicer canâ€™t or wonâ€™t foreclose for reasons Iâ€™m unclear about but may be because my mother attained the house through a HUD loan. The house was in need of major repairs when that family had moved in but is now in extreme disrepair and is uninhabitable and is most certainly not worth what is owed on it, nor would it be profitable for anyone to try to flip it because the area is also low income and houses donâ€™t go for much.  The debt owed on the house is about ###. The house has brought us such pain and frustration since our mother died, and I just wish someone had told us to let the place go but we didnâ€™t know what else to do at the time. Is there anything we can do to not have this on our hands? Weâ€™re really young and itâ€™s destroyed our credit.  43625.7708333333 I have more information if needed 43626.8597222222 Precious,Thanks for posting your question.  Sorry for the situation you're in.  Any attorney who handles civil defense work should be able to help you out.  Most general practitioners would be able to handle a case like this.  This is definitely a case where you need an attorney.  You could also wind up getting your driver's license suspended due to lack of insurance, so I'd get an attorney involved ASAP.   If you have any other follow-up questions, don't hesitate to reply.  Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck with this matter.###43627.5513888889 Thank you for the information 43627.6027777778 was in a car accident didnâ€™t have any car insurance the lady I was in car accident is trying to sue me what kind of lawyer do I need43626.8583333333 If you are good at completing the forms, sure, you may file pro se.

I got the wipers fixed and was allowed to leave with my car. This was about a month ago.Today, I received a call notifying me that I owed the dealership $400+ dollars, and that the warranty did not go through. If I had known that Iâ€™d have to pay for a service I was told would be free I would not have been able to get my wipers fixed that day. Am I liable for paying the ### if they told me that the warranty would cover it, even after double checking to make sure they were right?43628.8298611111 Unfortunately the answer isn't quite that simple.  If that is what happened and you didn't ### anything that could be considered misleading then you shouldn't be required to pay for the service.  However, you may have a tough time convincing a judge that is what happened.  You likely signed something when you authorized the work to be done obligating you to pay for whatever work was done.  You will be liable based on that and will essentially have the burden of showing that you reasonably relied on the dealer's representation that the work was a covered repair under an active warranty.Were you ever told why the warranty charge didn't go through?  That is likely the key to this issue and you may want to appeal that decision to resolve the problem.  If there is a good reason why the warranty didn't go through that involves you then you will be required to pay for the repair.43628.8472222222 I agree. 43630.7430555556 I have been contacted in order to settle an outstanding account from 20###4, I am unsure how to proceed.

So if non-signing spouse owns something with signing spouse then the creditor can go after it depending upon how it is titled.  Normally, spouses own things in both of their names but there are different ways that the ownership could be titled.  When two or more people jointly own something the ownership is typically going to be either Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship (meaning when one joint owner dies their interest goes to the remaining owners) or Tenants in Common (which means that if one owner dies their ownership is transferred by their will or the laws of intestate succession.  There is a third form of ownership unique to married couples which works like joint tenants but is called Tenancy by the Entirety or TBE.  If all property is owned as TBE then whichever spouse dies first the ownership vests entirely in the surviving spouse just like joint tenancy.  What is unique about TBE is that in Missouri the TBE is seen as separate from either spouse so that a judgment against either spouse cannot be used to levy against any property owned by the couple as TBE.I recognize that was a lot of information but the ### of it is that so long as bank accounts, cars, homes, etc. are all owned together as TBE they are going to be exempt from any efforts of the creditor of any one spouse but not a creditor that has a judgment against both spouses.  TBE is the standard way for things to be titled by married couples but that doesn't necessarily mean that everything that you have is titled that way.  If there is anything titled as joint tenants (which is possible) or tenants in common (unlikely) then the asset will be subject to signing spouse's creditor's attempt to satisfy a judgment. 43629.8791666667 Is the spouse whose name is not on is liable in any way?43629.0256944444 So can the place the car loan come after anything the spouse has? If I am understanding correctly they canâ€™t. 43629.8541666667 The spouse who didnâ€™t co-sign is not liable for the debt but the other spouseâ€™s hit on the credit rating can impact the coupleâ€™s ability to borrow. It is never a good idea to co-sign a loan for someone and it should be avoided at all costs. 43629.2263888889 How do I get a resolved matter off my record so it doesnâ€™t show up on case net? 43629.0895833333 The short answer is you canâ€™t. 43629.2270833333 I doubt that the the wage garnishment will be reduced in exchange for your agreeing to pay $###.

Additionally, improperly placing a mechanic's lien on real estate can subject you to damages for slander of title. That said, in order to file a mechanic's lien the contract with the homeowner must have contained the required statutory notice language.  In addition, you must place the lien within a specified period of time of the work being completed and you must file suit within six months of filing the mechanic's lien if the lien remains unsatisfied.Because of the risks associated with improperly filing a mechanic's lien you really need to retain an attorney to assist you with this or you will end up not only not getting paid but actually paying the homeowner.43635.9125 need to file mechanics lien tomake ### get money from contractor.

There are different types of auto insurance coverages that exist, so it is possible that the insurance company means that there is not a particular type of insurance on the car, but there was another type that allowed for payment to the lienholder.  It is also possible that the lienholder itself had a separate auto insurance policy on the vehicle (such policies are rare, but they do exist). 43665.5930555556 Hello I received a phone call this morning requarding a broken legal contract with a credit issuer.

Before I had child support no one could take me to court for debt. Are they able to take me to court and garnish my checking account due to the fact I have both social security and child support and do I have anything to worry about?43648.6902777778 You should be worried about getting sued.  A judgment against you might not be collectible but it may harm your credit score. Be concerned that your bank accounts could get garnished.  The SSA cannot be garnished directly but if you deposit the money in a bank account it could get garnished. Depending on the amount sought, consider meeting with a bankruptcy attorney.  43654.5888888889 I didnâ€™t say there was nothing you could do. What I said was that proving misrepresentation would be very difficult. With the proper evidence it can be done it just wonâ€™t be easy. 43651.6590277778 I understand what you are saying, I've read over this contract multiple times atleast what i have and what they copied for me and there is absolutely no trace of anything about late fees and I understand how payments are broke down between principle and intrest.  When I was late they didn't notify my mother or give her any opportunity to do anything or say anything they simply say it was on us to keep our communication open even though completely different addresses. So basically I got screwed out of it all I have a personal witness that was with me when I was told the car had not been in any accidents. It said in the co tract if over ###. Its just hard for me to believe that there is nothing that can be done! I also habe the full inspection from a ### dealer with the damages that were found and the severity. 43649.9645833333 My payments were made each month and if they were going to be late they were always notified. Questions as followedCan they legally ### a line through my name on the contract and change my mother from co-signer to buyer? The vehicle was damaged which caused frame damage upon question they became very defensive and said that dont know anything even when asked the day I bought it if it had been in any accidents and for the car fax review got the answer no it has never been in an accident" is that legal?They're reason to reposses it is that I didnt have insurance which I had proof of the day i bought it and the day I took it back it had not lapsed yet there was still two weeks left on my insurance before having to renew. Is that a reason to reposess even ### there was proof of insurance? If repossesion was set forth do they have to legally notify every person on the ###? Before reselling do they have to notify each individual on the ###?"43649.9159722222 On ### 27th I purchased a ###. Seemed like a great car, a month or two after the car went to ### because it had a knocking sound in the exhaust, the entire exhaust system had to be replaced, window regulator, and a recall on the brake ### stopper. The car went back to ### after to have a full inspection because they wanted to purchase it upon that inspection at ### ### in ### MO they found ### car had been in two accidents ### frame damage and other damages that were never repaired. I was not informed of this when I purchased the vehicle for $11,###, ### said the value of the car was no more than $###. About ###. i did just that I personally took the car to the lot and parked it, went in to talk to the people there and was told there was nothing I could do other than pay the car completely off, they said I didnt have insurance which I had proof of so I then asked for copies of the documents in ### folder, I wanted my payment history and every document in the folder they told me I wasnt allowed to have anything other than what I signed. Upon recieving the copies I found that my name was marked out of the contract and was informed that I owed $###! I need legal advice because I cannot find a lawyer in my area that handles Consumer Fraud and I feel like my mother and I were scammed beyond belief because unlike any other dealership they did not give a chance to fix said issue they claimed as a reason to ### the vehicle as well as crossing my name off the loan and charging fees that were not disclosed upon purchase or in the contract and charging repossesion fees when I personally dropped the vehicle off, theybhave security cameras to prove it. Someone please help guide me in the direction I need to be! I have paid over $### ###! 43649.6861111111 What you must understand is that you cannot make payments late because that breaches the contract and ### you to being told that you must come up with the full amount due immediately.  Its called an acceleration clause and every car loan has one.  Additionally, if you don't pay on time you will be subject to late fees or additional interest fees or both.  I know that you claim there was nothing providing for late fees but I find that very hard to believe as every loan agreement I have ever seen contains such fees.  You mention that you were told that you owed $###, the late fees would have already been paid out of the payments that you made as payments go to satisfy late fees first, then interest and finally to principal.  Because of that if you were making late payments you almost certainly were behind on the loan.I can't say why they would have changed it from your mother being co-signor to buyer but from a legal standpoint it makes little difference as your mother's legal obligations to pay on the note would be the exact same.As for the issues with the vehicle, as I said before it is buyer beware and there is no warranty unless expressly provided.  In other words, the purchase is an as-is" sale with you assuming all of the risk associated with any problems with the vehicle after purchase.  That is why I said you should never buy a used vehicle without having a mechanic that you know and trust evaluate the vehicle before you purchase it.  You mention that you asked about any prior accidents and were told that there were none.  Theoretically that could be a basis for a claim of misrepresentation.  However you have the burden of proving that such a conversation took place and that the salesman lied and told you that the vehicle had no prior accidents.  You said you asked for the carfax but evidently didn't get one which cuts against your credibility on the issue.  What you need to understand is that the judge routinely has buyers that have their cars ### claim that the seller misrepresented the condition of the vehicle.  Without something fairly definitive it will be difficult to prevail on such a claim.Technically there was no repossession here as you simply drove it back and left it with the dealer so any notice issues are moot."43649.9569444444 You clearly have omitted significant information which is necessary to make sense of all of this.  You first talk about buying a vehicle which you believe was in multiple accidents and that was not disclosed to you when you purchased it.  You then jump to being told by someone that you had to return the vehicle which you did.  I'm guessing that the missing piece is that you were not making the payments which is why you were told that you needed to return the vehicle.As for you first issue, the law in regard to a used car is ### emptor which means buyer beware.  In other words, the seller has no obligation to warn you or tell you anything about the condition of the vehicle.  So the dealer would not have to tell you about the prior accidents even if the dealer was aware of them unless you specifically asked.  In that case the dealer could not lie about the accident history of the vehicle without exposing itself to being sued for misrepresentation but he could simply say that he was not aware of any accidents (assuming that he wasn't).  Bottom line, when it comes to buying a used car NEVER EVER EVER buy a used car without first having the vehicle inspected by a mechanic that you know and trust to evaluate the condition of the vehicle.In regard to the second issue, are you saying that you made all of the required payments on time and in the full amounts so there was no basis for the dealer to repossess the vehicle?  If so then you may have something to pursue but if you were behind in making payments then you don't have much to stand on.  As soon as a borrower fails to make a payment in full the borrower has breached the contract and the lender has the right to insist that the full amount of the loan be paid immediately.  If the dealer ### the vehicle the dealer must then sell the vehicle in a commercially reasonable fashion and apply whatever it recovers from the sale to the amount that you owe on the loan.  If the amount recovered exceeds the amount that remains outstanding on the loan then you get the extra but if the amount the vehicle sells for is less than the amount you owe then you will still be obligated to pay the shortfall.That is the best I can do without further information.43649.9 Are you saying that after you agreed to settle for two payments of $###'t actually make those payments or are you saying that you did make the payments and now they seemingly are pursuing more?  It is also important to know whether you are actually being sued by Capital One or by a debt buyer that now owns the debt and is suing you for the difference.  The reason I ask is because there are a lot of companies out there that buy the written off debts of credit card companies and then try to get money out of folks whether or not they are legally entitled to.  Often these folks are violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and as a result they could be ### under the FDCPA.  If that is the case you can often find an attorney that handles these (we call them ### debt cases) on a contingency fee basis since they can hit the debt buyer with paying for the FDCPA violations.Generally, if you have not been served you don't technically need to appear for court.  However, if the process server claims to have served you and you don't appear then you will have a default judgment entered against you.As for a defense, I know of no defense to a debt owed other than FDCPA violations.  If you can prove that you had a settlement agreement with Capital One in exchange for paying $### - just know that you will have the burden of proving it.43651.9145833333 I have found out through case net that I have capital one attempting to serve me with a summons for ###th in circuit court over a cc I had with them a few years back. It is for about $###, and we agreed to settle last year for ### $###. Iâ€™m wondering what I should do if they still havenâ€™t served me? It says the summons was returned since I had moved. I canâ€™t afford an attorney supporting a child, working full time and having bills /student loans to pay. I lost my savings when I missed work during the death of my father and a miscarriage so I am in a tough spot financially. I guess what Iâ€™m asking is should I show up for the court day if I havenâ€™t been served? If so what would be my best plea. Thank you so much for your time 43651.8305555556 Ok thank you. The credit card was for $###â€™t know for sure what theyâ€™re wanting at this point, probably between $###### before those fees. Could I call and attempt to settle on a payment plan with one of their attorneys before I get served or go to court ? 43651.9805555556 Thanks so much for responding, I did not make those payments but agreed to then didnâ€™t hear back from the man I spoke too. When I called him back he said it was no longer valid. After that I didnâ€™t hear anything until I received letters from multiple attorneys informing me of what was happening. I attached my info from case net if that helps show who the law suit is actually coming from. That information is very helpful and I hope that is the case. Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. If I do go should I ask for documentation and offer what my actually debt is without the insane amount of interest they added? Thanks again!43651.9284722222 When you don't pay a credit card it has insane interest which accrues rapidly.  In addition, you said you agreed to pay $### $###'t seem that much different.  You also are going to have to pay the attorney fees for the suit charged by the credit card company's attorneys so if they are citing a large amount that could be part of it.  Since you didn't pay the credit company to begin with I suspect that this is actually Capital One and you have no defense.  I could not make anything from what you attached. You need to understand that merely putting off creditors will only make matters worse and the amount owed will significantly increase.43651.9770833333 Yes you can try to work out a payment plan but I suspect at this point you will have to sign a consent judgment. That is a document allowing the creditor to enter a judgment for the full amount owed plus interest, attorney fees and costs. The typical agreement is for you to make monthly payments of $X for Y months and so long as you make the payments they donâ€™t file the consent judgment. Obviously if you fail to make a payment they can file the consent judgment and pursue execution and garnishment efforts. Have you considered filing for bankruptcy? If this is your only debt then it doesnâ€™t make sense but if you have other debts when added together it may make sense to consider bankruptcy. If you have other debts you may want to speak with ### ###, a friend of mine that used to office with me.

The reason being that both parties are entitled to the property but there is no procedure to address the issue outside of divorce which is only available to married couples.  You can certainly file suit to obtain a declaration from the court that you are the owner under equitable grounds since he has not made any payments on the vehicle but it is not a simple process and the fact that you were living in the house without paying rent may be an offset against your argument that he never made payments on the car.As for the house issue, since you are not on the deed and were never married to him you have no legal basis for any claim to the house.The only other comment I would make is that you should never pay cash for things as it leaves no money trail to establish that you made such payments in the event that you should ever need to prove such payments later on.43658.6319444444 My ex and I purchased a car together last year I asked him to pay some of the payment he refuses to do so, do I have any grounds to make him help me with payment? Can he do anything with the jointly owned vehicle  in court to get out of helping me pay? Am I entitled to an equitable interest in the house it is in his name only but was acquired after our son was born to be our family home but always refused to put my name on it, I did contribute to bills but with cash, and I maintained the property he promised to marry me and put my name on the house for years told me he was leaving it to me in his will. I feel so used 43658.2743055556 What you have said is that you contributed to bills but with cash only and that you cleaned and maintained the house. To the extent that you paid cash you will have a difficult time proving your contributions. Additionally, since you werenâ€™t married and were living there rent free any payments can simply be attributed to your contribution in lieu of rent. Can a court grant you an interest in the house? Yes. Is it likely to do so? Not without some very good evidence of contributions and detrimental reliance by you. What you need to understand is that if I write up a document and have it notarized in which I promise to put your name on the deed I still have no legal obligation to put your name on the deed. The reason being that it isnâ€™t a legal contract because there isnâ€™t consideration given by both sides. Such a document is merely an unenforceable promise. For it to be an enforceable contract you must also have agreed to give consideration to the deal. The only exception is where you can show detrimental reliance on the promise. Bottom line it may be possible to get a Court of equity to grant you an interest in the house but it will be a long shot. What is more likely that you are able to get him to turn over the vehicle to you by taking his name off of the vehicle in exchange for you dropping the suit. 43667.6743055556 Mr. ###,You need to review the paperwork from the transaction to determine what rights you now have.  If the sale was not contingent on the particular financing, the transaction may have already been completed and you may need to find another way to pay for the car you purchased.  An attorney on this forum cannot determine whether or not there was a final contract, and whether or not the sale of your ### was permissible.If you are not able to undo the contract today, you should consult with an attorney who can review the documents and advise you as to your options.Thank you.43663.7229166667 Traded in my car for a new car and signed all paperwork but about week or two later loan fell apart, so I told them I was coming to pick up my car on Monday and keep hearing since Monday my car will be here today. I think they sold my car before the deal was completed, want to know my options if they don't have my car today.43663.6986111111 I looked at your docket sheet.  It appears that you have your trial and the judge is allowing the parties to submit proposed judgments.  The plaintiff submitted a proposed judgment.   Unfortunately, you were up against and attorney and probably failed to litigate the case properly.  You are not entitled to a ###.  You had your trial and the judge will soon rule.  The judge is not at this point going to consider new evidence.I'm sorry to say this but you should begin planning your next steps because a large judgment against you may be forthcoming.

However, there is a reasonable likelihood that you under the doctrine of necessities that you would have been liable for the medical bills anyway.  I'm guessing that you aren't relying on anything other than the divorce decree to assert that this is not your debt.  What you need to understand is that the divorce decree only assessed the debts as between you and your ex-husband as the two of you were the only ones before the court.  The divorce decree has no legal authority to eliminate legal obligations that you had before the divorce was entered.  The reason is that the medical providers were not parties to the divorce so the court's ruling as to which of the two of you is responsible has no legal bearing on your legal obligation to the medical providers.  The divorce decree merely allows you to go after your ex-husband for the amounts that you ultimately end up paying.  The divorce decree is not a defense to the garnishment or the judgment against you for the amount of the medical bills.  I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but you are still legally obligated on the judgment that you entered into regarding the medical bills.43664.8805555556 I am buying a car from a carlot. I got it ### pulled over and told that my tags weren't registered to any vehicle. I called the DMV and they said he wasn't a liscensed car dealer at the time he sold me the jeep.

He found out and now is trying to repo my jeep. I need to know how to keep him from taking my jeep when I have not been default on it once. He is claiming that I am behind in my payments which is not true. 43665.8416666667 Schedule an appointment with a consumer law attorney.  Bring the contract and payment history.  I do not know the facts of your situation. Generally, a lender wonâ€™t repossess and sell a vehicle of the borrower is not in breach.  That doesnâ€™t make sense as a business practice. 43668.0340277778 my car was repossessed just after I made my ### payment , on the ### ###  while my July payment was not due yet, Missouri finance co, stated that I was in default. which I was not.what can I do about this, they want me to pay $###.###.### ###### ######, Mo. 43665.8854166667 I was placed on ssdi several years ago due to rheumatoid arthritis and depression..  I had credit card debt.  I called an attorney at the time, and was told I was too poor for  bankruptcy and that the court would not take my ssdi.  after that, my daughter died, and i quit making the payments to the funeral home.  I think it was around $1000. I just received a judgment for a payment plus cost through the ### County Curcuit court for this debt. I own my home. I bought it about a year before my daughter died for $7,###.  It deeded and still needs a lot of repair, as you can imagine. It was the only thing and is the only thing I can afford. On ###, a ### County Sheriff's  department deputy came and evacuated me from my home, and it flooded.  I don't k now the extent of the damage as water still surrounds the area and I can not get home.I have no desire to ### my obligations, and through the years this has caused a lot of anxiety and sleepless nights. please tell me what can i do?Can they take my home?Can i do a bankruptcy myself.43665.9722222222 Iâ€™m sorry that you are going through such tough times.  If you own your home outright and have a judgment then the judgment may be â€œtranscribedâ€ and become a lien so long as the suit wasnâ€™t filed in small claims court. Most creditors wonâ€™t force the sale of the home but itâ€™s possible.  Try to work out a payment plan with the creditor. I hope things improve for you. 43670.525 I called back awhile after the matter because they told me their manager would get ahold me and never did, and was told that I should've asked my insurance company, I had attempted to look into my insurance information first and saw that they did, but wanted to make sure and called the doctor to double check as I'd run into this problem just weeks before, but I had apparently been looking in the wrong area for my insurance, so I didn't get correct results. The ### is for $200, and my insurance plan doesn't offer out of network benefits.43668.9527777778 I contacted a doctor's office to ask if they accepted my insurance before scheduling an appointment, and they told me that they did, and if they did not they would contact me before my appointment to which I never heard anything back. When checking in to my appointment I asked the receptionist if they took my insurance and she told me that they wouldn't have scheduled me if they didn't. Three weeks after my appointment I get a call that their office doesnt actually accept it, and then billed me for the full amount I wasn't expecting to pay, I never would have gone if I'd known from the start that they didn't take my insurance, do I have a case at all?43667.0631944444 I'm not familiar with any health insurance policy that doesn't offer out of network benefits.  You should also be looking at your EOB to see how your insurance company dealt with the transaction.  Essentially what you will need to do is negotiate with the provider to accept a reasonable amount since it provided you with false information as to it accepting your insurance.  Even if you had insurance you would likely have had to pay something on the ### and the provider would have accepted a negotiated discount from the insurance company had you had the insurance that it accepts.  So basically work something out to pay the provider in a lump sum around $###.You asked if you have a case at all?"  If you are thinking that you can sue the provider and recover damages you are mistaken.  You could file suit to dispute the amount at issue but that is typically done as a defense to the provider suing you.  The only thing that a lawsuit would do is address the amount that is owed.  You could assert misrepresentation on the part of the doctor's office in saying that it was in network but that would only be a defense to you owing the full amount of the ###."43669.1680555556 My insurance is through the affordable health care act so it functions a little differently, I don't have any out of network benefits with this plan. I reached out to the insurance company and they told me they received a claim for the appointment and that it was denied due to it ### out of network. I spoke to a receptionist at a legal aid office, and though they weren't able to help me she recommended small claims court might be the way to go, but I'm also unsure if you can take a large company like a hospital to a small claims court.43678.1354166667 These are tough cases as the doctorâ€™s office is likely to deny having told you that it accepted your insurance or alternatively claim that it is your responsibility to ensure that the provider is in your plan. The first question is what is the provider trying to charge you? Even if it is out of network, your insurer will normally pay out of network benefits. So is the provider dissatisfied with that amount or is it that your plan has a larger separate out of network deductible which you havenâ€™t met so the plan isnâ€™t paying anything on the claim? So what is the full amount of the ### and how much, if anything, did your plan pay? You should be sure to check your explanation of benefits (EOB) to compare with the ### ###ing. 43667.6555555556 You can sue anyone in small claims court but what are you suing for? Small claims is to get money from someone that either owes you money or for damages you sustained. In this case the provider is contending that you owe it money which you are disputing. There is such a thing as s declaratory judgment claim where the court will determine what rights each party has or if you owe anything but I donâ€™t think a DJ is available in small claims court. 43678.2138888889 If a creditor has filed a suit for judgement in my county against me, is there any disadvantage to allowing the judgement awarded prior to filing bankruptcy? I have ### ###. My only asset is my home. Otherwise I am essentially judgement proof as my only income is Social Security disability. Also, how can I get a continuance on the court date to prepare bankruptcy documents if necessary to file ch ###?43667.64375 You arenâ€™t going to be able to stall your case for well more than a year.  You should defend the suit or you might end up surprised by the judgment amount. If a judgment is entered against you it could become a real estate lien that survives bankruptcy. 43668.075 Is there a Mo. law that keeps the ###â€™m behind on, from collecting or turning me into collections while on workmenâ€™s compensation?43669.8541666667 No. When you enter into a loan agreement it is a contract and you are obligated to pay it back under its terms. While getting injured may well make it tough to make your payments that isnâ€™t the lenderâ€™s problem. I know that may sound cold but it is the law. 43670.0013888889 Back in ### ### ### ### ###. I have talked to them even went threw BBB and the attorney general now OTC is stating that i attend classes for ###. I have been fighting this for months now yes I have had credit cards debts before and I have paid them off but I don't believe I should have to pay a debt that I didn't get myself into. Please can you help me clear this awful situation up. Thank you,      ### ### 43670.7854166667 Hello!! Thank you so much for your time! :) How should someone with no credit, go about getting their carâ€™s ### loan  switched into their name after a divorce? Is it possible for this to happen with no credit? And if so, how? Also will that person with no credit have to already have a job with existing steady income? Will the person with no credit be turned down?43678.7541666667 The only way to get that accomplished is to refinance the vehicle solely in the name of the person that is keeping the vehicle and have it retitled in that person's name.  The problem that you are going to have is that the person must have sufficient credit and income to get approved for such a loan.  If you have no credit history and no income then it is unlikely that you will be able to get a loan on the vehicle.43678.7972222222 The updated current balance for the car is $###. 43678.7590277778 I'm guessing this is the case with the ###:  ### - ### ### V ### G ### & ### SIDES.  If so, the original judgment was for only $###.  With roughly nine years of interest and court costs, the balance now would be slightly over $###.00.If no probate estate was opened after Ms. ###'s death, you have a difficult situation.  You're also not far from ten years since the judgment was entered, at which time it will be presumed paid under Missouri law.There are legal proceedings which may be filed, such as a motion under Civil Rule ### (b) seeking relief from the judgment on the basis that it is no longer equitable that it remain in force.  A good local attorney can better evaluate what types of actions have the best chance of success.  It might also be possible to pay the full judgment (approximately $###+) into the registry of the court and obtain a court order that the judgment has been paid in full.It's a bit surprising that a small judgment from nearly ten years ago (with a dead plaintiff) would prevent a landlord from renting to you.   The easier solution might be to look elsewhere for a different apartment or see if the landlord will rent to you with a co-signor?It may not be worth the expense of hiring an attorney, since the judgment will be ten years old in less than a year.  Best wishes.43696.1347222222 I'm unable to rent an apartment due to this judgement but u have the money to pay, I just don't know where to send it or who to send it to.  I have to provide the potential landlord with proof it has been taken care and I'm not able to.  It was expected I would move in on ###st.  How can I get this information?43678.8263888889 Clearly the situation you have described is not usually how it works.  The employer is required to withhold money from all your earnings, and remit the funds withheld regularly to the Family Support Payment Center.  I'm guessing that what is occurring may have to do with with your tips.  I don't know how tips are handled where you work, but if most or all of your income is from tips, and you are not turning over the required portion of the tips each ###, this could be part of the problem.  It's also possible your employer has had issues with being held liable for ### in the past. But the employer is not concerned with what you are able" to pay in as the amount of the proper required withholding from pay or tips is what must be paid.You failed to provide information about the other party or parties involved in your case as requested.  I don't know if this is your case or not:  ### - ### YOUNG V ### ### (E-CASE).  If it is an amended withholding order was just issued (see ###):### Filing:  AMENDED INCOME WITHHOLDING FOR SUPPORT ### PROCESSED AMENDED INCOME WITHHOLDING FOR SUPPORT AND SENT COPY TO NCP EMPLOYER VIA CERTIFIED MAIL AND COPY TO NCP VIA REGULAR MAIL ON ### ###It's also possible that you're not completely understanding what the employer is doing and a communication issue may be involved.  If you continue to have issues (i.e. incorrect withholding) and you cannot reach an amicable resolution with your employer you may need to retain an attorney to work this out for you.  However you also do not want to give your employer reason to terminate you.Hopefully this is helpful but you still may need to hire a lawyer to communicate with your employer.  Best wishes."43707.5506944444 Current situation is as follows; my employer was sent court ordered wage garnishment for my child support. 50% of my taxable income. I work in a restaurant so my income is tips. The wage garnishment has been in effect for just over a year now. These past few months I have had issues with the money being sent to my daughters mother. So, from what I understand, my employer, or more specifically my general manager and the restaurants accountant, is handling the process in a manner in which I find to be borderline illegal. I was told, per my ###, that the restaurant (my employer) fronts the money at the beginning of the month and throughout the month, my income is withheld as stated by the wage garnishment and that money goes back into the pocket of my employer. Basically, the restaurant loans the money and I pay them back. This is something that they (the ### and their accountant) decided to do on their own. That being said, if at the end of the month I am short on my wage garnishment, Iâ€™m shorting my employer. This is the second occasion that I have come up short and my ### has approached me in an unprofessional manner and came at me saying I have to get that money back to them. The ### has even decided to go outside the confines of the court ordered wage garnishment when I am short and has decided to withhold more than the 50% just to see to it that the restaurant gets paid back. All in all, itâ€™s creating a hostile work environment and my ### basically approaches me like a loan shark if I happen to come up short. Is this legal for my employer to do? Shouldnâ€™t my money be collected during the month and the check be cut for what I was able to pay in? If I do end up short and the check is less than what it should be, isnâ€™t the state that is supposed to approach me about covering the amount I am short and not my employer looking for a ### on the money they fronted?43679.3597222222 Contact a bankruptcy attorney near you.  You may search on ###, mobar.org, or Martindale.com. 43683.1479166667 I'm just returning from treatment  and am on a very limited budget. I need to file bankruptcy. How do I go about doing that?43679.66875 I currently have a garnishment coming out of my check biweekly in the amount of 25% of my wages. This is currently putting me in a hardship. I currently pay all my bills alone and I have a stepson that I have been financially responsible for since his birth. What options do I have to lower the percentage been taken out? Would I qualify for head of household?43685.5666666667 If you are head of household tell your employer that it should only withhold ten percent. 43688.6020833333 All Missouri judgments earn interest at 9% so the amount asserted for the garnishment would have continued to earn interest at the rate of 9% until paid in full.  So the amount listed as the amount owed on ### would have only been the full amount due if you had immediately paid it that day.  I cannot say whether or not the calculation is correct but the creditor is certainly entitled to the full amount of interest on the judgment until it is paid in full.

I still have the contact details for the purchaser in ### if that could help me.Thank you for your time### ###43693.7854166667 I'll inquire and let you know what I find.  I should warn you that it may cost close to the $### $800.  Once I get a name or two I will forward them to you.43703.6854166667 Items such as a boat that must be registered have titles identifying the legal owner of the property.  The traditional means of selling such an item is for the owner to sign the title in the appropriate place and give it to the buyer at the time of transfer.  It is then incumbent upon the new owner to submit the title to the state department of revenue with the appropriate title application so that a new title can be issued.  Part of the reason for this requirement is to ensure that the property is not stolen.  In fact, in Missouri it is illegal to sell a registered item without providing the title to the buyer at the time of sale for this very reason.In your case I presume that the problem is that the storage facility didn't have a title to provide the buyer at the auction.  I suspect that there was a procedure for the storage facility to have obtained a title or its equivalent but it simply didn't bother to do so.  Bottom line is that without any type of title to provide to the Missouri Department of Revenue you must establish that you are the legal owner of the boat by filing a declaratory judgment action to establish title in your name.  There is no other way around this.  I know that there are some attorneys that have done a fair amount of these such tha they can do them ### (inexpensively).  Generally you name all of the folks that could arguably have a claim to the boat as defendants and when they don't bother to appear for court here in Missouri after having been served then the judge enters judgment in your favor establishing you as the legal owner.  That judgment is what the DOR needs in order to issue a title in your name.If you would like I can ask the bar what attorneys regularly do these in ### County and provide you with their name or names.  I do not recommend that you do this on your own as you don't want to go through the whole process only to find that you didn't get the magic language included in the judge's judgment so it is rejected by the DOR and you have to start all over and do it again.Just let me know and I'll try to round up some attorneys for you.43693.9291666667 That would be great! I did call one local attorney and was told it would cost much more than my $###. Hopefully they were just higher than most.43703.6756944444 If someone used my car and got hit by another car it wasn't insured and they fled the scene is the person that use my car responsible to pay for my car that only has liability in a civil case.

While she was operating the vehicle, it was struck by an uninsured motorist.  You did not have collision or uninsured motorist coverage on your vehicle.It isn't ### from what you wrote that the person driving your car was negligent in any manner.   You would be well-advised to consult with an attorney, who can review the facts and evidence in depth.  While you can sue the person using your car, an attorney on this site cannot predict the outcome of the case.  Best wishes.43695.1729166667 I have no idea what you are referring to when you say â€œbias circumstances.â€ As for the charges not being authorized, every time you get a hotel room they require that you provide a credit card for â€œincidentals.â€  That is precisely what this comes under. While it may well be poor customer service it is fairly standard practice in the industry. 43696.6743055556 I shouldnâ€™t have said I have no idea what you mean by â€œbias circumstancesâ€ as I suspected you were referring to discrimination. I simply wasnâ€™t sure if and I wanted to know if that was what you meant before addressing it.From your reply Iâ€™m guessing you are a member of a protected class. The protected classes are race, age, sex, religion, national origin and disability. Many folks mistakenly believe that all discrimination is illegal but in fact it is only illegal if it is based upon someone being a member of one of the above protected classes. So if the hotel charged you for the missing items because of your race, religion, etc then that could be illegal. However it isnâ€™t worth the effort from a cost standpoint since the amount at issue is only $###. 43697.6 I truly appreciate your time and advice on this matter. And I tried to make this explanation of what occurred, at  the Hotel as plain and comprehensive as possible. And to whom ever I may be communicating with, I thought that by saying False accusation possibly originated from bias circumstances would have been adequate for making a long story shorter. To give you some idea of what is meant on my terms as" bias circumstances" the word bias is mostly referred  as to "be prejudice or ###. And I would think that any lawyer or educated person would know that. And as mentioned in the note to you I'm not trying to prosecute or file a law suit against any one. I'm just seeking legal advice to the questions pertaining to this type of incident. So that I can know my rights if any, and that I may or may have not been discriminated in some way. Because of my appearance, race, or social back ground or where I came from. If indeed any these factors led to their decision of charging my card. This is definitely a poor customer service tactic in the fairly standard practice of the Hotel industry. In many incidents through out the American history and culture, many have been discriminated without knowing on a daily basis, because of Race, Religion, Creed, Color.

If your wife was not on the account, and if she didn't have your power of attorney, she shouldn't have been able to write checks or withdraw money.  I would push the issue with the bank . . . they need to reimburse you for this.  I'd also suggest going to the police and filing charges against her for fraud, theft, stealing, etc., or whatever the police believe is appropriate.  It sounds like she committed a crime by doing what she did.  If all else fails, you can file a lawsuit against her for recovery of the money she stole" along with possibly additional damages.  If you sue her for under $50 you can do it yourself in small claims court.  If it is for more than $50 you'll have to go in regular court and should have an attorney assist you.I hope this helps.

I have many questions, but in general, if his company was a Missouri LLC and the Secretary of State had not dissolved the LLC prior to your transaction, then the company existed and could contract with you.  There is a difference between not paying annual registrations to the Secretary of State and dissolution.  As long as the LLC was not dissolved, it could contract with you.43704.9236111111 Hi ###:  The rules for business licenses vary depending upon the town or city in which the business is located, but many places do require that a business have a local license.  In ### County, the County Collector issues ### licenses, but different towns in the county may have separate rules.  Since I don't know where you are, I can't be precise in my answer. I am guessing that you are concerned that there will be a penalty for the failure to pay fees for a license in the past and you might now be responsible for the penalty.  Whether you are responsible probably will depend upon whether you bought the stock of an incorporated company that is in business, or just selected business assets.  If you just bought the assets, you shouldn't be responsible for past failure to pay for a license.  If you bought stock, the company has a continuing obligation, but I doubt the penalty will be significant, if any, if you go to get the license now.

Is that legal?43702.7048611111 I may have used the wrong terminology. When I look him up on the secretary of state's office for Missouri it shows that his company hasn't been registered with them since 2015. He had an llc.

That was in 2017.43704.8708333333 There isn't a particular specialty which would apply to your claim against Graveyard Towing.  I would suggest you inquire of local general practice attorneys for advice and possible representation.  Depending on the value of the vehicle, the attorney may suggest you file a small claims case against the towing company.  Best wishes.43711.6201388889 What type of law firm do I need to contact for help with  this issue, please?My car was towed to and stored at Graveyard Towing Company as a police impound. I was able to pay the tow ### in a timely fashion (within a few days) altho the day I called to finalize the details on retrieving my car, I was informed by the owner ###, that it had burned up in an accident at the tow yard.The car next to mine had caught fire in a yet to be determined way and had caught mine on fire, as the flames from the first car caused the propane tank in my ### to ignite. Then ### demanded that I pay my tow ### in full so my car could be included with the claim being turned in to his insurance company.After a couple of days of him not seeming to have any knowledge of the status of my car or claim or even what insurance company was being used, I finally got a name and number out of him and called the adjuster.The adjuster ### (adjuster for ###s' son's tow yard insurance company) told me that ### turned the claim into his son's insurance company (even tho the car was not a his son's tow yard), he had reviewed the security tape and the claim was denied. That ### was in the process of filing a claim with his own insurance company for Graveyard Towing but their adjuster would rely heavily on ###'s investigation, findings and decision when making their decision and would probably deny the claim as well.That if I was thinking about making a claim against the insurance of the vehicle that originally caught fire, that that company would most likely not pay unless there was a mechanical defect or negligence on the part of the car's owner.After a couple of weeks I tried to call ### to check the status of the new claim and he wouldn't talk to me he just kept telling me to call the insurance adjuster.43703.6972222222  I am being sued over a ### credit card of ###â€™m on disability I tried for legal aid but they turned me down because theyâ€™re too busy I was wondering what do I need to do in court if I donâ€™t have an attorney or is there anything the collector can you do to me being on disability making only ###43706.025 Mr. ###,If I'm looking at the right case on ###, there has already been a motion for summary judgment filed and ###th.  ### - CROWN ASSET MANAGEMENT LLC V ### ### (E-CASE).

In other words you should go see a lawyer now pay for a consultation and make sure you are in fact "judgment proof."While there is a good chance that a judgment against you will not be able to be collected I see another case where a judgment was transcribed to circuit court so that there will be a lien on any real estate you own:  ### - ### FUNDING LLC V ### ### (E-CASE).A 30-minute consultation with an attorney should not be expensive and will enable you to make a decision about how to handle the current lawsuit.Best ###"43707.5694444444 Mr. ###,If this debt was in existence at the time of your bankruptcy case filing, it may have been included in your discharge whether it was listed or not on your schedules.  Either you or your attorney usually (although not always) would have run a credit report before filing.  You may have the option of reopening your bankruptcy case to set aside the discharge and amend your schedules, or (as is in the case in the Eastern District of Missouri US Bankruptcy Court), any unsecured debt which could have been listed is considered discharged in a ### Chapter ###.The first thing you need to do is to go back to your bankruptcy attorney (or another bankruptcy attorney) and determine what can be done.

The judgment will include court costs and attorneys fees if it is based upon a contract that provides for attorneys fees. The judgment amount will also include pre-judgment if the contract provides for interest. The judgment will continue to earn interest at that same rate (if in the contract) or at the legal rate of 9% (if there is no contract rate).  The judgment will remain valid for a period of ten years but can be revived for additional ten year periods. In terms of efforts to satisfy the judgment the creditor can go after your bank accounts, your vehicles and any other assets you may acquire.43711.2631944444 if on disability and a collector is suing me. The only thing I have is a car Iâ€™m still paying on and -###. Can they still get into my bank account or my car or just shoot my credit score down?????43710.1840277778 Generally speaking a seller has no obligation to disclosure issues with a vehicle it is selling. The standard is ### emptor which means buyer beware. However, a seller may not misrepresent the condition of the vehicle but that doesnâ€™t apply to general comments about the vehicle as that is typical ###. So it would be misrepresentation to say the vehicle has never been in an accident (as it clearly was) but it is permissible to say that itâ€™s a great car. If this is something that would have shown up in a standard state inspection then you may have a basis for dealing with the dealership as I thought dealers were required to have an inspection done before selling the vehicle.Never ever purchase a used vehicle without first having it looked at by a trusted mechanic. If the seller wonâ€™t agree to you having a mechanic look at the vehicle then you donâ€™t want the car. 43713.1541666667 I would think so. 43713.5798611111 Thank you for your quick response.When we purchased the car I asked the salesman if the title was a salvaged title and he told us no. When we got the title in the mail it states salvaged". Would that be considered misrepresentation.

Was the dealership negligent in not disclosing the damaged frame?43713.1416666667 ### of ###. I went to court and accepted. At the time I did not know of statute of limitations or my rights or anything of the nature. Looking at the documents they had sent me for court (loan agreement I signed when I got the loan in 2012), states that the loan is controlled by ### law. Have I screwed myself and restarted the SOL by not knowing about SOL or my rights to begin with? Or is there something I can do for them filing a lawsuit after the SOL. The original creditor has not sold the loan.43713.6305555556 A statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, and needed to be raised when you were sued.  There is nothing which prevents a creditor from filing suit even though there is a possible SOL defense.Assuming that there would have been a ### SOL concerning this debt, you would need to confer with a ### attorney about it.  You may or may not be correctly assuming there was a SOL defense available to you.  These are ### statutes, often with many exceptions determining when the statute begins to run.Unfortunately the time to hire a lawyer was back when you were served.  However having an attorney review the judgment would be advisable, and the attorney may also be able to negotiate a lump sum settlement for far less than the judgment.  It would still be a good idea to see a local attorney for advice and representation.43713.6423611111 I hope it's ok I'm going to attach the first letter to the title loan company's.

I have reviewed your letter and your account.  I have also spoken with our employees about your account.  It appears that everything is in order with your account.  The interest rate applicable to your account is in compliance with Missouri law.  We believe the interest rate was clearly disclosed to you and that you had the opportunity to review your agreement and learn of the interest rate that would apply to your loan.  The interest rate is disclosed on the first page of the loan agreement.  In addition, the Reminder to Borrower document you signed identifies the interest rate and also includes the statement: Please note this is a higher interest loan."While we understand this is a loan with a higher interest rate than a traditional lender might offer we can assure you that the rate is permitted under Missouri law. We appreciate your business and your recent payment.  We are willing to forgive the remaining balance on your account and close your account.  You may stop by the store at any time and retrieve your title and release of our lien.  If you are unable to make arrangements directly with the store to pick up your title please let me know.Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.Thank you.My reply will have to be attached as well.My question is do I have it right? I don't want to let them get away with taking advantage of me because I was a clueless ### year old.Thank you for any reading my letters and any advice you can give.Also I told the manager not to credit the rest of my loan.

It was a ###.43717.8798611111 Title loans are ### and the interest is unreasonably high.  That being said, I would not advise arguing about this for the principle of it only.  Litigation is expensive and it is hard to prove a violation in truth in lending laws. You likely signed many pieces of paper to get the loan and the APR is likely somewhere. You haven't mentioned whether you got your title back. This is of upmost importance to do ASAP. You could sue later if you could prove your case. Any part of this loan being outstanding could hurt your credit for another loan or lease. Unless you owe a large amount you cannot pay, I suggest you pay it off. You can always write your legislators about the pitfalls of title and pay day loans.43717.7166666667 ###,Thanks for posting your question. I'm glad to try to point you in the right direction.  You have several options:###.  File a lawsuit against the driver of the other car if that person was at fault.  You do not have a claim against his insurance company, but have it against him as he hit you.  If you sue him, his insurance company should then defend the lawsuit.  If the claim is $5,###, you can sue him in Small Claims Court.###.  Turn it in to your insurance company and have them pay you (provided you have insurance that would cover this).  They will then try to recover from the other insurance company if they think it is appropriate.  This, unfortunately, may affect your insurance rates in the future though.I hope this helps.

I'm glad to try to point you in the right direction.  Unfortunately, there's no way to  force a settlement upon the other side.  It takes both parties to agree to settle.  Once side can absolutely refuse to even negotiate a settlement and can exercise their right to go to court to get a judgment against you for the full amount.  So, whether you can settle the case depends on how willing the other side is.To start out any negotiation, simply call the attorney who is listed on the lawsuit and make an offer to them.  E.g., if you want to see if they'll take payment of $###, then offer that.  I'd always suggest offering less than you're willing to pay as the other side will almost always come back with a counteroffer.  Keep in mind that the other side may still want to take a judgment against you for the amount of the settlement or payment terms, so be careful about that.  The only way they'd dismiss the lawsuit would be if you were able to pay off the settlement all at once.  An attorney can also try to negotiate terms of a settlement, but you are welcome to contact the Plaintiff's attorney to try it on your own.  If you'd like to retain an attorney, you can look earlier on this site where there is a list of pro bono agencies that may be able to assist you.If you have any follow up questions, please don't hesitate to reply to this message.

While you may have a judgment, it may or may not be valid or enforceable.  There is no way to determine if the Missouri court had jurisdiction over the subject matter or the defendant.  You may or may not have sued the correct defendant.  There may be terms in your auction contract requiring that the matter be litigated in another state, or by binding arbitration.  The return of service (### card) was not sent restricted delivery, and there is no registered agent for a Heritage Auctions" on the Missouri Secretary of State's web site.  Filing suit in Missouri and (if correct) obtaining service upon the company's registered agent in another state is very possibly bad service.  In addition if you were dealing with the "big" Heritage Auctions ### its headquarters are in ### Texas.I don't know what property of the defendant you intend to attempt to attach through garnishment but there is a very good chance your judgment is void or unenforceable.

The loan was taken out because they would get a really good interest rate and the person needing the money would not due to poor credit. Several payments were made by check from the person by the loan due date each month and receipts were written out and given to the person. They missed a month and then another and so forth. The loan still had to be paid. Does a verbal agreement hold up in court and worth taking the person to get some or all of the unpaid debt back?43723.9243055556 An oral contract is binding and can be enforced in court. The problem is typically proving the existence of the terms. If you can prove that there was a contract you should be able to obtain a judgment. The problem is often turning that judgment into cash. You said that you took out the loan because you had better credit but you failed to recognize what that meant. Banks are professionals at assessing who is and who is not a good credit risk but you chose to disregard the experts opinion and take on the credit risk yourself. I hope that you have learned your lesson and will never ever ever ever put yourself in this position again. If this person has a steady job you may be able to get at least some of your money by garnishing his wages once youâ€™ve gotten a judgment. Good luck. 43724.0277777778 Thank you for your response.

There's no point in calling the creditor's attorney.  What you should do is to find a local lawyer that deals with debt matters to thoroughly review your assets and finances and determine if there is any way a creditor could collect on a judgment.  It probably does not matter if you permit a default judgment to be entered (and not show up) but I cannot recommend you do this without at least a conference with a debt attorney to make sure.  You'll also need guidance about handle post-judgment matters - such as any possible motion for a judgment debtor examination bank account garnishment etc.  Your bank should treat the account into which your social security is deposited as exempt from execution but errors occur.  Most likely the advice you will receive is to just skip court and let the creditor have an uncollectable judgment but you really need to schedule a conference with a good local attorney to make sure.Best wishes."43736.5083333333 Even though it is in a judgement and decree of paternity.

You should sit down with a good financial counselor - if you have not already done so - before filing for bankruptcy.  I provide pro bono (free) financial counseling and I would be happy to meet with you or talk by phone if you are not close to my office.In the meantime, I will try to answer your bankruptcy questions:There are ### - your bankruptcy lawyer and the court will determine which type is right for you.  One type (chapter 13) allows you to make payments to the court to pay off your debts and keep your assets.  The other type (chapter 7) is liquidation - which means that the court will sell any valuable assets (if any) and put that money toward your debts, the remaining balances will be discharged (written off).The bankruptcy court will divide your assets into two categories:  exempt and non exempt.  You will be able to keep you exempt assets and this will certainly include your children's toys and beds - unless they have something extremely unusual and valuable.  There are also exemptions for furniture and other household goods.Below I have a link to the Bankruptcy Court's booklet on the basics of bankruptcy.  It will answer more of your questions and has lots of details:###Bankruptcy is a great way to get a fresh start, but don't be afraid to call me or some other financial counselor if you want to try to avoid bankruptcy after reading and thinking about your situation further.

Really need to file chapter 7.43747.7722222222 Whether or not the original creditor wrote off the debt has no bearing on your legal obligation to pay a debt unless the original creditor wrote off the debt as part of a settlement of a disputed amount.  So generally, a ### is not going to be a defense to suit. That said, the creditor that you list as filing suit sounds familiar to me as what we call a ### Debt Collector.  These are companies that buy in bulk old uncollectable debt from companies at literally ###Â¢ or ###Â¢ on the dollar and then go after folks to try and pressure them into paying something on the debt.  Sometimes the debt can't be legally pursued because it is beyond the statute of limitations for the debt or even cases where the debt has been discharged in bankruptcy.  Even if the debt would otherwise be valid, it is very seldom that the debt buyer has obtained all of the documentation necessary for it to actually prevail in court if you are properly represented.  Most of the time these guys have nothing more than a spreadsheet listing all of the debts purchased with account balances and account numbers.  I have yet to see these folks actually have the underlying credit agreement necessary to prove that you owe anything.  These folks are basically using the courts to extort money from those most vulnerable and least able to defend themselves.  Most lawyers consider these folks beyond reprehensible but there are always some lawyers that are willing to file suit for them.The good news is that you don't have to be a victim.  Most of the time these creditors engage in conduct that is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).  If they have then you have a counterclaim that you can file against them and receive statutory damages.  Because of that, there are lawyers that do a lot of these ### Debt cases on a contingency fee basis meaning that it won't cost you anything up front but the lawyer will be entitled to receive a portion of any recovery.  You mention that the court in which this is pending is ### County.  I can't say for certain but I think that ### ### handles in Saint ### handles these cases in ### County.

It appears that you did not file an answer or other responsive pleading to the summons, and are in default.  Whether you appear or not tomorrow, I expect the judge will grant the default judgment.  There's no way an attorney on this forum can determine whether or not the judgment will be able to be collected or the other possible effects of the judgment such as property liens.No offense intended, but you should have consulted with an attorney long ago.  An attorney on this forum cannot possibly evaluate your situation - whether or not bankruptcy is possible and/or advisable.  You need an attorney.Although the judge may not grant such a request, you could appear tomorrow and ask for a continuance in order to hire a lawyer.  However regardless of what occurs tomorrow, you need to set up a consultation with an attorney to determine how you should proceed.  The attorney will need to evaluate your sources of income and assets, and what is best for you to do.  It may be that all you need to do is make sure you are judgment proof."

Thank you.43758.7777777778 You will be asked questions by the attorney representing the other party but those questions will be directed at showing that you took out a loan and didnâ€™t make the payments as required. What you need to understand is that generally there are no excuses or explanations that change the fact that you took out a loan and didnâ€™t make all payments on time. If you have evidence to present that you arenâ€™t the one that took out the loan (identity theft) or that there was fraud by the lender that may have a bearing on your obligation to pay but any issues that you are dealing with financially or health wise arenâ€™t relevant. As for payment arrangements, the court will simply enter judgment against you in the full amount of the debt plus interest, court costs and attorney fees. You can discuss payment arrangements with opposing counsel but the judge wonâ€™t have anything to do with that. 43759.7965277778 will they ask me questions in court room to tell my side and set up payment arrangements43759.7 I paid to have work done on my car in December of 2018, (The car was overheating)the work was not done properly and now the exact problem that I paid to get repair need to be done again. I have called the auto shop however, they are not returning my call. What is the statue of limitation on car repair as I need to file a lawsuit again them? I took the car to another mechanic and they indicated that the job was not done well and they mechanic in December did not fix the problem and that is why the car continue to overheat.43759.8826388889 Ms. ###,Hopefully you've already resolved this problem.  You are nowhere near any statute of limitation for breach of contract or negligence, but filing quickly is usually better.  You should also make sure you have your evidence lined up, and a written statement from the mechanic detailing the exact details of what was done wrong.  You'll also likely need an expert witness (the 2nd mechanic) available to testify in your case.  Also, since the repair work was done almost a year ago, was there a warranty on the work?  If you had (for example) a ### warranty, your claim may be barred. You should review your paperwork from the initial repair carefully.  This may not be a statute of limitations issue, but a warranty issue.Just because a problem ### is not proof of a bad repair.  Although you didn't give details, if for example, your first mechanic did a radiator flush rather than replacing the radiator, and the overheating ### months later, the fault could be because of the less expensive repair you chose.  If you are planning to file a small claims case, it would probably be a good idea to pay for a consultation with an attorney before filing to get your claim and the evidence needed reviewed.Best wishes.43778.9145833333 Iâ€™m currently in chapter ###. This will be discharged ###20. My husband and I are going through a divorce. My current bankruptcy lawyer is essentially letting me go because my husband also filed bankruptcy separately and there is a conflict of interest. I have not been given a lift of stay to proceed with divorce. My husband who is not represented by a divorce attorney doesnâ€™t understand what that means and thinks I am trying to hide behind my bankruptcy to avoid paying him money he thinks I owe him. He reported me to the bankruptcy trustee and now Iâ€™m to report for a hearing. My bankruptcy lawyer wonâ€™t represent me now and I canâ€™t find anyone to take my case since my bankruptcy is almost complete and my husband is harassing everyone that helps me. He has reported my bankruptcy and divorce lawyer to the bar. Iâ€™m not sure what to do. Iâ€™m assuming I have to represent myself and I need guidance on how to do this. Also I need guidance on how to request a lift of stay from the bankruptcy court.43763.7451388889 Ms. ###,As an attorney with decades of practice in family law and bankruptcy, what you wrote does not make sense.

The judge must give the attorney permission to do this, and the normally the fee agreement requires the attorney to remain in the case and handle all regular matters arising during the Chapter ###.Regardless of the actual situation with your case and the trustee's motion (which most likely was already granted), you need to immediately hire a new attorney.

In such a case the insurance company basically says Judge here is a bucket of money that we owe and there are several people claiming it so you figure out how to ### it up."  In an interpleader you and the other parties will either have to come to an agreement between yourselves as to how to split the funds or litigate that issue before the court.You also mention that many of the claimants are minors.

I doubt that any document you draft would be of any value.  Even an attorney's well-drafted agreement containing a limitation on your liability for all future negligence might end up unenforceable.  But if you want to go this route, you should confer with a local attorney to have something drafted that would have a better chance of being enforceable.  You could ask the passenger to bear the cost.  The ### for what you are seeking is an exculpatory agreement" with a partial or complete liability waiver.  Laws vary from state to state but it is generally impossible to execute a waiver of severe or gross negligence.  If the passenger is injured in an accident you caused because of (for example) reckless driving or intoxication public policy would likely prevent enforcement of a waiver.For an extensive discussion of exculpatory contracts and waivers see:  https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/###0006520###0004878/05/EXCULPATORY-AGREEMENTS-AND-LIABILITY-WAIVERS-CHART-00###000652###0004874377x9EBBF.pdf  (copy also attached).  From that article:"Generally even if the waiver is held valid it will apply only to ordinary negligence. A majority of states hold that such agreements generally are void on the grounds that public policy precludes enforcement of a release that would shelter aggravated misconduct or gross negligence."Your other options would include:  (###000487)  don't drive this person to work;  (###000652)  increase your medical payment and liability insurance coverage.  You may find that increasing your insurance coverage to a level which would most likely cover any claims is not very costly and you could ask the passenger to reimburse you for the added cost.  Discuss this with your insurance agent to see if this is a feasible option.Best wishes."43781.6736111111 Thank you for sharing your knowledge. God Bless.

The medical ### have now gone to collection and no discussion of pain and suffering. What should I expect as a settlement?43790.8069444444 It largely depends on the amount of insurance limits available. Normally one can expect anywhere between two to three times the amount of damages. Damages consist of past medical bills, future medical bills, past lost wages, future lost wages, and pain and suffering. In order to maximize the amount of your recovery I would suggest you contact an experienced personal injury attorney to assist you with your case.43791.7180555556 I bought a car less than ### ###, can I get out of the loan? 43791.6451388889 Thank you Iâ€™m not sure the type of lawyer to contact would you happen to know?43791.6798611111 Thank you it did come with a warranty the loan is through my credit union. Think I should talk to the bank?43791.6618055556 The short answer is no. If it was a new car purchase you can pursue the protections provided by Missouriâ€™s Lemon Law to get the vehicle replaced. If it was a used car sale then it was likely sold â€œAs-Isâ€ with no warranty of any kind. The law regarding the purchase and sale of used vehicles is ### emptor which means buyer beware. You should never ever buy a used vehicle without first having it checked out by an auto mechanic that you trust. Even if it is a used vehicle with a warranty of some kind that will only allow you to press the seller to honor its warranty obligations. Loans associated with car sales are typically held by a lender separate from the seller. This is true even though you may have obtained the loan through the sellerâ€™s finance department.  As a result, any issues with the seller canâ€™t be asserted against the lender since it is a third-party. There are situations where the seller is actually the lender but those are normally limited to low end dealers that sell to high risk buyers. If that is your situation the fact that the lender is also the seller allows for the possibility of returning the vehicle and rescinding the sale. Just know that you donâ€™t legally have a right to do that. The only avenue available to you is to sue for fraud and misrepresentation in relation to the sale which is a tough case to prove. However, if the seller feels it has risk or is wanting to avoid negative publicity it might agree to rescind the deal. What is far more likely is that it would be willing to discuss selling you a different vehicle. 43791.6604166667 You can look for a Consumer Protection attorney or you might look under Lemon Law attorney, even though this doesn't technically come under ### Lemon Law if it was a used car.Good luck.43791.78125 You need to understand that the bank paid cash to the seller and under the UCC no claim that you may have against the seller can be asserted against the bank. In other words, this isnâ€™t the bankâ€™s problem. Accordingly, I donâ€™t see why the bank would be inclined to get involved. This isnâ€™t like a credit card dispute where you can contest the charges. Since it came with a warranty you are largely limited to whatever the warranty provides for. 43791.6666666667 ###,Thanks for posting your question.  Im glad to try to point you in the right direction.  Yes you can be sued for damages to the car even if the insurance company paid.  It is most likely pushed by the insurance company who is seeking reimbursement for money they paid out to the other driver.  If there's no personal injuries they'll sue you just for property damage.  As many insurance companies have deductibles the amount you can be sued for may be more than the insurance company paid out to the other party.  But the most they can sue you for (if there were no personal injuries) are the value of the car or the cost to repair the car whichever is less.I hope this helps.  If you have any follow up questions don't hesitate to reply to this message.  Otherwise I wish you the best of luck with this matter.###"43794.7048611111 As the documents show. The affidavit that was submitted was written by his secretary. Allstate insurance says they did not sue me. What do I do now?43794.7131944444 I was in  an accident without insurance. The attorney that  sued me had his secretary wrote and have notarized a statement saying she was an agent for the insurance company. The woman I hit got her car fixed by the insurance company and then sued me for more money. There was no injuries. Can they do this?43794.6972222222 The document isn't a lawsuit, it's a Judgment that's already been taken against you because you didn't show up on the assigned court date.  You're going to have to file a Motion to Set Aside the Default Judgment and then contest the case.  Don't worry too much about who signed what at this point.  You're main concern should be getting this Judgment set aside.  I'd strongly encourage you to get an attorney to do so as this can be a complicated matter.In response to Allstate's comments . . . yes, they have not sued you directly.  It is most likely a subrogation action where their attorneys file a lawsuit in the name of the driver and the driver agrees to pay them back any money that the insurance paid.43794.73125 Dear Ms. ###,The actions of the persons who came to your house may from the basis for a claim under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).  I would suggest you seek out an attorney who handles FDCPA claims.  The law provides an award of attorney's fees in these cases.  You may have to search outside of your immediate area to find an attorney who handles FDCPA cases.  In the St. ### area I can suggest ### ###:  https://www.avvo.com/attorneys/63005-mo-###-###-1864065.htmlYou should keep accurate notes about all past or future contacts from the company, obtain a copy of the police report, and record or film any future visits.  Your FDCPA attorney can advise you in greater detail about documenting contacts.Best wishes.P.S.  The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function, but I doubt you will find the FDCPA specifically listed:  ###43806.2875 My son who is ###, he moved away to ### in September.  Since then they have came to my door being demanding and aggressive verbally telling me they want their merchandise.  My son isn't talking to me and I don't know where in ### he moved to exactly.  I have messaged him about this laptop.  This past Saturday on Nov.  23 ### ###.  He was yelling and screaming and knocking on the door for ###. I gave the police permission to search my home and he came to the conclusion as well there was no laptop or sign that my son lived there.  I have very high ### and ptsd.  Can I get a restraining order or sue the company and the manager for their extreme actions.  This isn't even my debt my son is grown. 43794.7819444444 Hello###, ###. I stopped at ### grocery and got some groceries and wrote a check for around $###. I came home here to ### MO. The check never did clear my bank. I called the store and they said they tried to deposit it but it came back insufficient. I asked how I could pay it and they said they turned it over to a lawyer, ### ###, KS. I contacted Mr ### and asked how I could take care of the check and he said it would be $###. At the time I felt this was steep for the amount of the check. I asked if $###. This was the last I heard of anything. I didnt hear from the court until ###. I did not have a way to get to ### and I wrote the court and ask for a new court date and was turned down. Judgment was granted in the amount of $###. I have never heard from the court or Mr. ### since, until a month ago, ###. I am disabled and have been for ###. The letter last month said from his office that the check is now payable for $###. Speaking frankly, as a ### ### student of the law, this is the biggest example of BS and abuse of power I have ever freaking heard or know of. It's nothing but a ### lawyer with no moral values abusing the system to gain wealth in a crock of s**t method. If it was enforceable then he would have already, so now what? Is he waiting until I buy something of value to put a garnishment on it since he cant my income? I have a $80k student loan, can he put that before my loan? I tried communicating with him and the court and no one wanted to make a little on it, but retire on it. Does the statutes play any role in this since its already been ruled on? Does being in a different state matter? He has a bad reputation for a lawyer, Ive checked, so what can he do? Thank you43796.1451388889 Thank you for taking the time to answer this. I have no reason to fabricate or fudge on anything I tell you. I have been taking care of my elderly parents at their home since before this occurred, meaning my mail comes with their mail. Mom gets the mail every day and it was probably six months period this was all going on at the beginning that I never know what was happening as mom picked and chose what she felt was important to me and what was not. I suppose that certifying mail is not a legal obligation to a ### ###, but I never received a certified letter from the other side or I would have know about this in more of a timely manner as it would have had to be signed for, legally letting me know what was taking place rather than one day from the court date. Also, I am guessing that because I am disabled, this being the reason a garnishment was not ordered. Thank you w/ Respect. ### >>also, mentioning a college education was not intended to mean that carries any ### of this, that would be wrong, I just mentioned it to let you know I am aware this is wrong therefore why I am asking your help. You do not need to spend more time on me. I will try to lump sum it and send him a payoff and he will - with his dog eating ###, come out looking like a hero to the store. Sickening, but there are rotten Dr's, ###, etc as well...43798.4236111111 You asked if the statutes have any bearing on this and the answer is yes.  I donâ€™t know what the statute in ### provides but in Missouri you would have had to pay three (###) times the amount of the check in civil penalties. In this case that would have been about $###. You should also know that bouncing a check is actually a crime since it is illegal to write checks beyond the amount that one has deposited in their account. Additionally, the statutes also provide for post-judgment interest to be added to any judgment entered at the ### statutory rate. Again I donâ€™t know what ### provides but Missouriâ€™s rate is 9% which would come to $### (9) years for a current total amount of $###000652,### $###000487,###00065200. I donâ€™t know how the amount jumped to $###000487,### ($###) bounced check but ### may well allow attorney fees to be added to the judgment. You should also understand that the lawyer isnâ€™t going to be getting everything over the original amount owed but rather the interest is payable to the store since it is the one that is out the money from the bad check. Accordingly this isnâ€™t a lawyer trying to let this go to increase the recovery. In fact, quite the opposite since the likelihood of recovery drops dramatically the longer the debt remains unpaid. You mention that you are a â€œfourth year ... student of the law.â€  As such, you no doubt understand that you needed to address the issue prior to a judgment being entered or at the latest immediately thereafter by filing a motion to set aside the judgment. You likewise understand that the system is designed this way to minimize court procedures and ensure prompt adjudication of legal matters. To allow otherwise would permit things to be drug out indefinitely. As for your comment that if this were enforceable the lawyer would have pursued it already, I suspect that it was largely forgotten about due to the added complications with you not being a ### resident. It likely showed up on a list of judgments that were approaching ten (###0004870) years as the court probably has a rule that after ten (###0004870) years the judgment is presumed paid and no longer collectible. Note that wonâ€™t help you though as the courts also allow the creditor to file paperwork with the court that the debt hasnâ€™t been paid and for it to be revived for another ten (###0004870) year period. It is likely that the lawyerâ€™s system kicked this case out so that he could get it paid or revived. Your comment that this lawyer has a bad reputation has no bearing on the issue unless you can demonstrate that the attorney acted unethically. Note that the ### unethically refers to violating the ### Rules of Professional Conduct only and doesnâ€™t include behavior which you may feel is immoral. Bottom line he will have to register the judgment in Missouri before he can pursue anything against you in Missouri. 43796.7333333333 I currently have a garnishment against me. What recourse do do i have do get the amount lowered.. It has accrued ###.  Would communicating with them to lower the interest be an option?43799.6006944444 Unfortunately you have a judgment from ### ###% annual interest.  If you have a substantial amount to offer as a lump sum settlement, the creditor might accept a lower amount.  I cannot predict the creditor's position.  However there would be no reason for the creditor to reduce the amount due under the judgment unless it is part of a lump sum settlement being paid. You may want to explore the possibility of filing a Chapter ### ###.  This would likely be the least expensive way to ### deal with your financial situation.  Best wishes.43799.63125 Happy Monday! ;-)I am being sued by a company for credit card debt. As the amount is relatively small, I am not interested in declaring bankruptcy. While I initially made all payments in a timely manner, when my employment ended and I wasn't able to secure alternate employment in a timely manner, I fell behind on my payments until it became impossible for me to catch up. Hence, the lawsuit. As I will be presenting myself in court, I would like to know what my options are, what my rights are, and what is the typical format of proceedings like these (i.e. how I can expect the process to go, how much time I'll be given to present my case, likely outcomes, etc.) so that I can prepare.Thanks immensely for any assistance that you provide! I appreciate it! xDAs a token of my appreciation, here's a quick joke:So two lawyers walk into a bar...LOL43801.9298611111 This forum is for asking specific civil law questions.  Unfortunately it is not for asking questions about how to represent yourself, and broad questions about your options" or "rights."  I do not know what possible defenses you believe you have to the petition or what evidence you wish to present at the trial.  It is usually possible to settle these cases for a lump sum amount far less than the full balance.  You can make an offer before or at court.If you chose to represent yourself you need to make sure you are in the courtroom before the docket call.  There will be a large number of cases on a docket.  When your case is called you need to make your announcement.  The case will probably be put on 2nd call for you to talk to the plaintiff's attorney.  Usually the first court date is not a trial date.  If the case is continued or set for trial or settled make sure you understand exactly what you sign and retain a copy.  If you agree to a consent judgment with payments make sure the interest rate the judgment will earn is stated and you fully understand anything you sign"43804.8027777778 I had a civil suit filed against me in St. ### county Missouri. I am trying to file my answer back to the complaint and I am trying to avoid driving to St. ### county everytime I need to file paperwork. Is there any other way for me to file? Or should I attempt to request a change of venue? I am currently not financially able to retain a lawyer but could pay some to file the paperwork. It will be way after my deadline before I can hire a lawyer. Due to situations beyond my control I didnt get much notice before this court date and already had one extension. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 43802.7472222222 It appears this a suit to confirm an unpaid arbitration award, usually for enforcement purposes.  I do not know what, if any, defense you may have to the suit.  Pleadings are electronically filed by attorneys.  In order to file anything for you, an attorney would have to enter his or her appearance as your attorney.  It is therefore unlikely you will find an attorney willing to electronically file for you.  Once the attorney enters an appearance, he or she cannot withdraw without court approval.You should be able to mail in your pleadings with a certificate of service to the opposing attorney, and enclose an additional copy and return envelope asking the court to return a file-stamped copy.  I suggest you contact the court clerk in St. ### to make sure your mail pleadings will be accepted, and if there is anything special you need to do in that court.It appears there is a hearing scheduled for 12/###, so you will need to appear pro se or with counsel at that time.  You would be well-advised to seek legal counsel concerning this matter if you believe that you have a valid defense to confirmation of the arbitration decision.  I doubt there is a basis for a change of venue, and you may already have waived any venue issue by not raising it immediately.Best wishes.43802.8354166667 We have several credit cards and personal loans. We lost some income and had to move in with are daughter when she became ill. We are trying to pay our bills and some of hers. The debts we have have not been payed for several months. Two of them have judgements on me. We are on Social Security and just canâ€™t pay all the bills. We canâ€™t afford to pay a lawyer for filing. We just need guidance in filling out the forms43802.8270833333 Absent a formal contract granting you the right to repossess the computer, including all of the necessary filing requirements, you have no legal right to the computer. You can certainly sue in small claims court for the amount owed but you donâ€™t have any legal right to the computer. As such if you report the computer as stolen you will be guilty of filing a false police report. What you need to understand is that you chose to lend money to someone that the professionals recognized was not a good risk. If ### credit is such that neither the bank nor the store was willing to extend credit then you shouldnâ€™t agree to lend the money yourself unless you are fully prepared to give that amount to the person free and clear. You wouldnâ€™t perform dental work on yourself so why assume that you are more capable of assessing credit risk better than the pros?43806.8513888889 I purchased a computer several months ago. I bought this pc with the intent to sell it to my friend who couldnâ€™t afford all of it up front but could make payments to me for it. I didnâ€™t mind helping him out because he needs a computer for many things he does and I had the available credit. However, after several months he stopped making payments to me. He was going through a rough time financially and I told him I understood and I could give him a few weeks to get back on track. Two months have gone by without me receiving any money from him. I told him I was getting frustrated and wanted the rest of the money he owes me. We agreed on a specific date he would pay me by and he has yet to do so. I was promised $### $200. The account, receipt, and credit card used to buy the pc are all in my name. My question is: Can I take the PC back from him and will I legally owe him any of his money back? I believe he has realized he doesnâ€™t have money to pay me and is attempting to hide the computer from me or is just taking advantage of my kindness. Can I call the police if he refuses to give it up? What happens if he tries to call the police on me for stealing from him?43806.8416666667 Thank you for your response, I am glad I asked before I took any action. Although the situation isnâ€™t fair I understand that there is not much that can be done. Thank you for your insight.

As an ethical matter I would not feel comfortable giving you any advice other than to strongly encourage you to hire a business attorney to assist you with this transaction.  It is not an unnecessary added expense but in fact an absolute necessity to ensure that you don't end up being taken advantage of.  A good business attorney doesn't cost you money - he/she ### you money!43815.9173611111 My sister and I are looking to buy into a franchise to start a business. An attorney she was recommended to, looked over our ### and took it upon himself to send a cease and desist to the franchise as well as my sister's bank. This has put a ### on our plans. My sister has asked the lawyer to ### the cease and desist but he refuses to. This is prohibiting us from moving forward in the process that is timely. The lawyer is retained by my sister, not me but she wants out and does not know how to move forward. We can ultimately be sued from the franchise because we have signed a contract with them. Please help! We do not know what to do!43815.7548611111 I am currently being sued in ### County, MO. For $###. I was informed on ### of their intent to collect from an attorney. I wrote back within ###/stop collections. I received a letter back  in November with some information from attorney, but not all of the information requested. A deputy policeman will be serving me on ###, hearing scheduled ###. I know that this is my loan and that it is within the statute of limitations. Can I just pay the ### company without them going through the courts? Or do I have to go to the courts. I am completely lost and there are no attorneys in my area that have an opening for pro bono work as I am very poor. Attached photo is of initial letter from attorney. I do not have a photo with me if their second response or serving papers, but will tomorrow afternoon. 43815.8208333333 The safest thing to do is show up at court.  Contact opposing counsel in advance to obtain the payoff amount to avoid a judgment.  Expect that sum to include interest and court costs and maybe attorneyâ€™s fees. 43816.2236111111 I am being sued in the 31st Judicial Court in ### county MO by the debt buying company ### Funding for a defaulted capital one credit card account in the amount of $###. I have never been sued before so this is very frustrating and confusing, navigating my possible ### , or settlement options especially with the case being held in circuit Court as opposed to small claims. My understanding is that it is much more difficult to represent myself in circuit Court vs small claims. The included attached documents are what I received when served at my front door a couple weeks ago as well as my credit report.  ### seems to be well prepared for any ### if I push the burden of proof on them but, then again, I don't fully understand what is required from them to adequately prove their claims against me. I have been struggling to properly word my answer, afraid of the consequences of possible mistakes in the answers. I'm not sure if there are any affirmative ###s I can use or if an answer of ignorance is a wise approach to this case. Also, there are a few collections on my credit report so I'm also wondering if using bankruptcy for negotiation a settlement would be an option.Best case scenario I think I can hope for is winning the case by paying a lawyer or settling in court on my own. Thank you for taking the time to consider my request for legal advice and I hope to hear from you soon.Sincerely,-### ###43815.98125 Itâ€™s good that you are taking the case seriously. Here are a few comments.   Threatening to file bankruptcy provides little leverage.  Everyone says that.  Some file.  Some donâ€™t, but the opposing counsel wonâ€™t be moved. I havenâ€™t a viable defense from you.  A reasonable outcome might be to negotiate a settlement for a discounted sum, to be paid in installments, with an Administrative Rule ###.  Such an order advises the court that the parties are settling under a payment plan.  If you honor the plan, the case gets dismissed upon completion of the payments.  If you breach it, then a consent judgment gets entered and it harms your credit.  If the case gets dismissed, itâ€™s as if you won at trial.i hope this answer helps. 43816.2208333333 Dear Ms. ###,This forum is for asking specific civil law questions, but it is not a substitute for hiring an attorney.  You have the right to attempt to represent yourself, however often this is difficult, frustrating and leads to an unsatisfactory outcome.  It appears you need to retain an attorney at least to assist you.  This site is not for learning how to practice law and  represent yourself.You may be able to retain an attorney for limited scope representation in order to keep the cost down.  Looking at ### I am not sure you ever paid the filing fee for your small claims case, served the named defendant or even sued the correct defendant.  There is no record of a ### Furniture" on the Missouri Secretary of State's Office and you may need to do some checking to find the correct defendant*.  I cannot speculate as to your rights under the contract and you should review it with an attorney.  An attorney can also help you determine what evidence and witnesses you will need for a trial.You can either attempt to continue to represent yourself or hire an attorney.  It seems like you need the help of a lawyer to pursue your claim.  Best wishes.*See:  https://bsd.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/BESearch.aspx?SearchType=0"43817.24375 I received back payment from ssa and wanted new furniture.

I would love to be able to accept exactly my â€œowedâ€ amount and â€œcourt ###â€ and be willing to drop the excess amount if she wasnâ€™t able to front the immediate costs at that point. I guess, my mind says - if it meant for her to realize that she could be released or not be held for more money she would give in.

This is where it spark the fuse.. she got hostile and said â€œdonâ€™t threaten me etc etcâ€ I always remain calm in my responses and kept assuring her I wasnâ€™t trying to cause any ill feelings, but mentioned how my husband inquired about non payment every time WE passed her employment. She got outraged and stated â€œso your husband is stalking me now huh?â€ â€œDonâ€™t make me put an ### against your husband who is stalking me daily and you for harassment.

If you win, the filing fee and sheriffâ€™s should be added to the judgment as â€œcosts.â€  Youâ€™ll have to collect the judgment, however. 43819.1888888889 Dear Mr. ###,I have doubts that you are within the income and asset limitations for using this forum, which are based on the federal poverty guidelines and assets of less than $5000.  If you qualified for a $35,###, most likely you are not eligible to use this site.  This forum is for asking specific civil law questions.  No offense intended, but what you wrote is very confusing and it appears you need help in handling your financial affairs.  Until your contractual negotiations and loan were complete, a person would not usually sign over the ### vehicle.  Stating that you were lured" by an advertisement may have purchased a ### vehicle and have some confusing paperwork are all concerning.  In order to give you a legal opinion you are going to need to retain a local attorney.  The advice you are seeking is beyond the scope of this site.  Your attorney will be able to review all of the documents involved and advise you as to your options.  I suggest you schedule a consultation immediately with an attorney particularly since you have apparently already turned over your ### vehicle.  You are probably not going to resolve this situation without an attorney and if you've accepted delivery of the new vehicle this even further complicates matters.

It is much appreciated. 43826.8701388889 Whether you voluntarily turned over the vehicle or ### had to repossess it doesn't have any bearing on the matter.  You entered into a contract to borrow a specified amount to buy the vehicle and are therefore obligated to pay back that amount.  The vehicle is merely collateral against the amount owed but it seldom is enough to cover the full amount of the outstanding balance.  The reason being that the vehicle will depreciate (lose value) faster than the loan balance amortizes (decreases).  So legally speaking you are incorrect as to your statement that it isn't your problem that ### didn't get enough out of the sale of your vehicle.As for you not having the resources or income with which to pay off the remaining balance, that is a different matter.  No doubt you are familiar with the old expression that you can't get blood out of a turnip.  Based upon your post it would appear that you are a turnip (that is my lame attempt at humor).  What I mean is that it doesn't appear that you have any funds with which to pay this debt.  If you convey this to the attorney and provide support that you have no other source of income then it is likely that the attorney will advise ### that the debt is ### and leave you alone.  You could of course file bankruptcy but that doesn't make much sense if this is the only debt out there that you need to get discharged.  That is particularly so if your only income source is social security as social security is not subject to garnishment.43826.6298611111 Youâ€™re welcome.

While you can file a bankruptcy petition without your wife, whether you should requires detailed consideration of you and your wife's assets, debts and income.  There may also be ways to deal with your debts without a bankruptcy filing.  Filing bankruptcy is generally the last choice, not the first.In bankruptcy you are required to list ALL debts you have, whether in your name alone or jointly with your wife or others.  Information about your wife's income and ### assets must be disclosed.  An attorney on this forum cannot speculate whether or not the house titled in your wife's name is safe" if you file alone.  Jointly owned household goods and other personal property are involved but may be within your exempt property limitations.

How do I explain this to the court? What do I need to do to set up a response. Is there anything else I need to do?43833.79375 If you are being sued Iâ€™m guessing that you failed to respond to the hospital when it reached out to seek payment arrangements. I say that because hospitals are generally very good about working with folks on billing so long as you respond and regularly make some kind of payment. Now that you are being sued that is no longer the case. The attorney will present the full amount of the bills along with his/her attorney fees plus interest to the court in order to obtain a judgment against you for that amount.I recognize that from your perspective the judge should take into account your particular financial situation but legally your lack of resources isnâ€™t even relevant to the case. The judge may allow you to tell your tale of woe but the reality is that the judge has little discretion to do anything but enter judgment in the full amount being sought. You can question the amount being charged on the basis that it is not reasonable. Ordinarily when you purchase goods or services the prices are clearly stated up front and you can decide whether or not to buy but with medical treatment you only find out after theyâ€™ve already been provided. For some ### reason hospitals list their prices well in excess of what anyone actually pays so the amount on the bills are going to be outrageous unless you had health insurance for it. Because of that you can question the amount that the hospital is asserting as not being reasonable. On your own you arenâ€™t likely to be very successful in that regard but you can certainly pursue that. You can also question the basis for adding attorneys fees since the hospital is only able to get those if you signed a contract agreeing to pay the other ### attorney fees. Odds are you signed something granting that but it will put the lawyer on notice that you arenâ€™t going to be walked on. I wish I could tell you that there is a way to make this go away but the reality is that there isnâ€™t. You most likely wonâ€™t have the trial that day but if you donâ€™t show up the court will enter a default judgment against you.  If the amount is large enough or if you have considerable other debts you can file bankruptcy to discharge them. If you are considering doing that you should do so before the court enters judgment. 43833.8708333333 I went into Mercy South hospital ### for a horrible reaction to ### medication given to me for gout. I was in for almost ###. I applied for financial assistance as I only receive social security disability. I was sent a letter requesting information about total income from everyone in the house. It is my son and I. He has not been able to work for over a year due to Crohn's disease. I received a letter in ### ###. In ###19, I received a ### from a collection agency for the $###. Now Mercy is telling me they can only go back ###, which no one said anything about this before. How can they say I was approved and then send it to collections the next month? While I was in the hospital, my purse was lost. I was inconvenienced for ###, but no one knows where, and was taken to patient advocate and turned in. It was not taken to security, lost and found. Someone must have put it in a cabinet and forgot about for ###. I had my check book  and credit cards that had to be cancelled due to their negligence. 43833.8118055556 You raised two separate issues.  As to the financial assistance, whatever written agreement you entered into will govern.  If you received the services then advised the provider that you could not pay and you were offered a payment plan, then there was no â€œconsiderationâ€ or thing of value given in exchange for the ### allowing a payment plan.  If a court were to assess the situation that way, then you owe the full sum.  Most hospitals will work with a patient who continues to make an effort to pay.  As to your lost purse, Iâ€™m not following what the hospital did wrong.  Was it in the hospitalâ€™s possession.  Although you were inconvenienced, Iâ€™m glad you got it bad.  Unless you suffered measurable financial damages, Iâ€™d let it go.  Not worth paying an attorney to file suit.  43843.2111111111 I bought a used car from ### ### after seeing his listing online.  When I went to check it out he repeatedly stressed the fact that he really had no idea why it wouldn't start but said he had been reassured more than once it was just a bad battery and/or starter.  He stated that he had someone driving from ### want to buy it at that time. I asked if he would be willing to give me the name of the person coming in the morning if I did buy it just in case I couldn't get it started the next day and he agreed.  He offered to lower the price from ### ###.  He went to get the title and when he came back I paid him $###.  The next morning my mechanic and I went to look at it in the daylight and he couldn't get it to start so I had it towed to my house.  Once there it was discovered there was antifreeze in the oil and a blown ### (I think that's how the mechanic worded it.).  When I asked for the the other person's info that wanted to buy it he said he didn't have it, that he had already deleted it and I should just go ahead and post it for sale again.   Looking at his profile I see that he has a long history of racing cars and is employed at an auto shop.  I think he knew exactly what was wrong with it and lied to make the sale.  I asked him for a ### of sale and he refuses to give me one, even pointed out that the title is not in his name even though he signed the back.  What if anything can I do to get my money back?  43835.55625 Ms. ###son:   Here are my thoughts ---* I do not know of automatic legal provision where you can make ### & back comes your money.

It is unlawful to buy or sell a vehicle unless the title is delivered with the vehicle.  See Section ###0###.######0.###.  By law the sale without the title delivery is void and fraudulent.  A person should never purchase a vehicle unless payment is made at the same time as delivery of the vehicle, TERM00110### of sale and completed transferred title. The second option would be to sue the seller to void the sale and attempt to get your money back. This might be handled through small claims court.  I don't know how much you paid for the vehicle.  Have you verified with the Missouri Department of Motor Vehicles that the person who gave you the TERM00110### of sale is the actual titled owner?  You will need the VIN, which should be on your TERM00110### of sale.Assuming the seller" is the sole owner on the existing title and you have a proper TERM00110### of sale signed by the titled owner it might be possible to to file suit probably a declaratory judgment action to obtain a court order requiring the DOR to issue a new title.

Please be very careful.     https://bestbankruptcycenter.com/?kpswh=WGXfPAAqmsvHnOYewCQp&sek=bankruptcy%20self%20filing%20forms&matchtype=e&creative=###&device=c&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjt6OsNbt5gIVR9bACh0hpAWZEAAYASAAEgLgwvD_BwEGod bless you,   ### K.43836.0048611111 What forms do I as a single person need to file to do bankruptcy myself43835.9923611111 To whom.  It may concern I have legal matters43836.3361111111 I purchased a vehicle from a dealership over ###, so the loan company cancelled the loan. The dealership is threatening to report the car stolen because the loan company cancelled the loan. I am wondering if this is possible? They are the ones responsible for sending in the title paperwork and since they didn't, and the loan company cancelled the loan, can they really report it stolen? I've heard that at this point it's their loss, but I cannot register the vehicle without the title anyway I know so I'm wondering what I can do with the vehicle.The vehicle has bumper damage to the front end I have cancelled the ### because they cancelled the loan so will I receive a ### for the damages or will they try to take me to civil court?43836.6159722222 You agreed to pay $X for the car and now that the loan didnâ€™t go through you havenâ€™t actually paid for the car. Under those circumstances you must return the vehicle. I recognize that you feel it is the dealerâ€™s fault that the loan didnâ€™t go through but it doesnâ€™t change the fact that you havenâ€™t paid for it. I would immediately return the vehicle and demand the return of whatever you paid down on the purchase. Incidentally, if you are saying that the dealer failed to provide you with a valid title at the time of sale that violates Missouri statute so the sale was void. That should give you some leverage in dealing with the dealership. Lastly, if the damage to the bumper occurred while in your possession then you will be liable for the damage. 43836.7069444444 Hello Kathalene,There are two things you can so to remedy your situation. First, I would ask for the police department to amend their report to include the information you believe to be relevant. Second, I would suggest hiring a personal injury plaintiff's attorney to handle your civil suit. An attorney will be able to file a cross-claim if he/she believes that someone is actually at fault for the accident. I know you are worried about having enough money to pay an attorney, however personal injury plaintiffs attorneys are paid on what is called a contingency fee basis. This means that you won't owe them any payment up front. Rather, the attorney will be paid a percentage portion out of whatever settlement or award they are able to obtain for you.43882.81875 I can tell you didn't read everything I wrote from your replies to my issues.  The police investigated this and said the report ### is off but they refuse to change the ### -- and thus, the present ### is incorrect and it shows I hit the driver who actually hit me.  There is police misconduct in this and the police favored the man who hit me and they ignored driver side damage to my car when making the crash report, although they saw this.This is not a personal injury case and there were no serious injuries.  There will be no large settlement of money that an attorney will get if he wins this, and thus, no attorney will take this unless I pay a retainer fee, which I can't afford to.  This is why I asked if  you know of an attorney who does pro bono work.  I'll just have to go to court and represent myself against some high ### attorneys -- and I don't like that -- but pictures of damage to my car are on my side.Kathalene43883.8923611111 I haven't gotten a reply from an attorney regarding what I wrote, and I know what I wrote is very long.I was in a car accident in Columiba, where the cop who responded ignored driver side damage to my car and made the report ### incorrectly (ignoring damage to my car) and incorrectly and unethically showed in the report ### that I (driver ###) hit driver ### -- when I did not -- but rather driver ###, as damage to my car shows.  ### police favored driver ###, they ignored this and showed he wasn't at fault in the report, when he was -- as damage to my car shows.  this is police misconduct in this.My car was totaled in this accident and the report ### is incorrect and I've never gotten compensation for my car.Now, I'm named as one of the defendants in this three car accident (the plaintiff is driver ###)and the report is not even correct, although I've requested ### police to correct it.

Do you know anyone who can represent me pro bono?

Driver ###'s corner and driver's front side area with the front of his car, and this caused my car to spin out of control in the intersection (to my right) and as this was happening, my car was hit a second time by the same driver into my driver's far rear side area.  This pushed my car east and up on the curb and this pushed driver ### ###rd car, vehicle ###.  Vehicle ###'s a witness to the color of the light at the time of the accident (and told the police driver ###) but driver ###. my car, v###, and vehicle ###. When ### police arrived, they inspected all cars and saw driver side damage to my car but they ignored this when making the crash report and ### ### (of ### police who made the crash report) made the report ### incorrectly, showing I (driver ###) hit driver ###, when I did not -- and pictures of damage to my car (v###) doesn't support the report ###, nor does the ### explain how my car got pushed up on the curb, as it did, where the police saw it when they came.  I purchased bodycam from ### police and printed off pictures of damage to all cars, which are attached.  There was police misconduct in this and ### ### from ### police saw driver side damage to my car but ignored it (as though it didn't exist) when making the report -- with her clearly favored driver ###, although there's evidence that driver ###.  Bodycam shows I was not liked by ### and she made negative remarks about me away from me, and it's obvious she wanted me to be at fault, although there was no evidence I had any fault -- and this is why I believe she made the crash report incorrectly, showing I was at fault when I was not.  I knew the report ### was incorrect as soon as I saw it.See attachment -- rest of story43867.8465277778 I filed my income tax last year and the department of education took my income tax money. I need my money very much because I have very low income, and I need my money very ### I also need help with the department of education to settle my debt.43837.8048611111 In November of 20###9, my car title lien was transferred from White Motor Co. in ###, MO to Cars R' Us in ###, MO. I received a letter in the mail informing me of this and that all previous contractual obligations would remain the same. This was fine with me, I would be making my payments to a different entity, no big deal. This morning, ###th, ###. Cars R' Us had repossessed it because they claimed I did not have insurance coverage on the vehicle. I immediately send them my insurance information and policy number which had not lapsed nor have a missed a payment since ownership of the vehicle. They then replied that it was because I had a $###,### $###. I frantically dug through all of my old mail in fear that I missed this notification, but I found none. I asked them when they had sent me documentation asking me to change my insurance policy, but they had not sent any documentation out requesting me to change my insurance policy. There has been absolutely no paper trial of them requesting me to update ANY information, because I would have gladly done so if they had!I called my insurance agent and promptly changed my policy to meet their requirements, and now they are asking me to pay a few hundred dollars to have the vehicle returned to me. I am super frustrated with their tactics to seemingly ### off customers and make some quick cash. I realize I do not have the money to pay them or hire a lawyer, but I feel this is just morally wrong on their behalf and very bad business practice. I just want my car back and pretend like this never happened, but paying their repossession fee just doesn't seem right to me. Please, any advice would be greatly appreciated. 43838.8652777778 Unfortunately, if you cannot afford to pay the money to get the car back or to hire an attorney then your only option (unless you find an attorney to work for you for free), is to file suit yourself.The key legal issue will be whether, if you were not carrying the ### agreed insurance, you were entitled to notice and an opportunity to get proper insurance.  I don't know that answer without conducting research.43839.6555555556 I got a title loan against my car a while back and haven't been making payments for many months as I cannot afford it with my new living situation. I'm worried about the potential for repossession. Are there any steps I can take to avoid repossession like working out a new payment plan or am I boned?43839.0118055556 You could file a Chapter ###. If the car gets sold, you cannot get it back.43868.6916666667 Can someone be charged for fees related to repairs to a repossessed vehicle? The repo guy just informed loved ones that they would be excessively charged for a battery replacement (he said probably $500. A new battery is $###) which to me implied fees related to the repair of their vehicle scheduled to be repossessed tomorrow. Upon calling the lender, they were informed that even if my loved ones paid their balance before their vehicle was sold, they'd be charged to have the repo guy to bring their vehicle back. Their current balance to pay off the loan is only a little over $###.43839.0277777778 Typically your loan contract (the Note) will outline what fees a borrower is liable for, which often times include any fees associated with the repossession and/or return of a vehicle rightfully repossessed due to nonpayment.43868.69375 Hello,I recently purchased a computer from a company of a friend that claimed to own a business to purchase the computer from. I even received an invoice through ### from the business". I made a purchase for 2000$ in Nov of ### ###. It is not going on months later and the "owner" is not answering calls or texts. Nor are they communicating with me about getting a refund. I have confirmed with the Missouri Attorney General that they are not a legitimate business and am seeking some way of retrieving my money back. I am currently in the military serving in Wyoming so I am unable to appear in small claims court in Missouri. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have plenty of screenshots and documents to show that this person claims to have run a business and that they are not ### calls or giving information. Below is a link to a google drive with a folder containing those pictures.https://drive.google.com/open?id=11dQXH4CB1lrBMKb36-n-vXgQWCiSOvq1Please advise thank you."43839.6923611111 I received in invoice through ### but paid through Facebook Pay via Messenger and the invoice was updated to show that the amount was paid.43839.7097222222 If the defendant doesn't show up then you ask the court to enter a default judgment in your favor for the amount of the money that paid, plus court costs and interest.  With that judgment you can then pursue reimbursement from this guy.   If he still refuses to refund the money then you can execute on any ### any income he has in Wyoming.  Assuming he has none, then you will have to register the judgment in a state where he has assets that you can execute on or income sources that you can garnish. 43839.75 If they don't appear in court in Wyoming where I am then what could be done? I could start the process here with the justification of what you said that I made the purchase while I was here but I highly doubt they would show up here to settle the dispute so what would the outcome be of that?43839.7215277778 Why did you pay that way?  ### is designed to provide you with the very protection you are needing now.  I don't know anything about Facebook Pay so cannot speak to whether or not it also provides any type of dispute process.  If it does, that is again your best bet to get this resolved.  Bottom line, it isn't really possible for you to pursue this here if you cannot appear in Missouri for the trial.  You could try to file small claims where you are located if that is where you were when you entered into the agreement.  Not saying that it will necessary fly from a personal jurisdiction standpoint but you can certainly argue that was where the contract was entered into.  Naturally, you will have to get the defendant served here but that would put the onus on him to appear where you are.  Once you have a judgment against him where you are it will then have to be registered here in Missouri (assuming this is where the defendant is located) in order to seek garnishment or execution of the defendant's finances.43839.7194444444 You said that you received an invoice through ###.  Did you pay via ###?  If so, you should be using ###'s dispute process to get your money back.43839.7083333333 that is very helpful, thank you so much. 43839.7513888889 I signed a contract on ### to have Champion Windows and Doors build a screened in room on the back of my house. In the contract they stated they would start approximately ### ###. They sent two young boys from ### ###. The workmanship was terrible throughout the whole project, but the key here is they didnâ€™t build the roof at a high enough ### to be able to shingle the roof, so they used ### tar paper and wanted the full money owed for the room. The room now is hardly tall enough for the ceiling fan to be installed (also in the contract). They offered ###  that they are not able to put on because the young boys built the room at too shallow of a ###. The room Champion built is not the room I was willing to pay $23,###. They refuse to talk to me about this and said I signed that the ###b was complete. They sent me a third and final ### for the full money owed. My question is about the form that was signed.  It stated that if no further work was needed, then pay in full. There is plenty of work still needed to be finished and all involved knew that. Work was stopped on more then one occasion and ### ###, district installation manager, came out and made an excuse for their poor workmanship. One of the screened doors is not even ### to the ground. The roof collects water and the ### leak in three spots. The walls were cut too short in many places so they filled them in with ###.  I have a list of over ###â€™t answer their phone. I have been calling and emailing, fighting through the BBB, emailing ### and any company person I can find for ###. Finally someone sends me a copy of this paper I sighed and said I have no choice but to pay them in full.  I am sending pictures and hoping that something can be done. The more I look into it the more I find complaints from older people like me. Just because those young boys asked my husband to sign this form so â€œwe can get paid and go home â€œ does not mean I should be stuck with having them bully me into paying for something they clearly broke contract on.  Is this worth spending more money and time to fight them? I am only allowed to send two photos. The first photo is a picture of the contract that states â€œshinglesâ€. The other picture is how they cut into the existing roof ###ed it and left it like ### is visible from the inside of the room.  Thank you for your time. Looking forward to your response. ### ### ###43843.6423611111 Unfortunately this is all too common a problem. Youâ€™ll probably have to hire a new contractor to (at the very least) get an estimate of what it will cost to fix the poor workmanship of the original contractor. I recommend hiring a lawyer to send a demand letter for that amount. The contractor will likely refuse to pay it and then your only recourse is to engage in construction litigation, which is expensive. Often times a $20,###. Your best bet is to get an estimate for damages and see if you can recoup even part of it from the contractor.43868.6979166667 If you are asking for an attorney to basically draft your cross-examination for you I don't think you are going to find anyone willing to do that for you.  Essentially you have to object to the ### of any documents on the basis of lack of foundation.If this debt has been sold a couple of times then it is what we refer to as ### debt because the creditor has essentially written it off and the debt buyer is trying to bring it back to life to get money out of you.  In many if not most cases the debts are no longer valid and the debt buyer seldom ever has the necessary documentation needed to be able to prove up its case.I strongly suggest that you contact an attorney that handles ### debt defense in the ### City area.  Generally what the current owner of this debt is doing is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).  Because of that, you can likely get an attorney that handles ### debt defense to handle this case for you without charging you anything up front.  If the creditor has violated the FDCPA your attorney can take their payment out of the money that the creditor ends up having to pay you for its violations of the statute.Off the top of my head I do not know who is handling these cases in ### City but ### ### handles them in the St. ### area and I'm confident she will know who is doing them in your area.  I would call her and ask.43843.8965277778 What processes do I need to take to represent myself at a hearing for credit card debt. Iâ€™ve read multiple places about asking for proof of debt but Iâ€™m not sure how to go about doing that or what all documents I should be asking for. I know the debt was sold at least twice before going down the legal route. Any insight into the steps I can take to make sure Iâ€™m completely covered and ready for the court date would be helpful. Debt total is $###43843.8458333333 Dear ###,Your next step (if you haven't already done so) is to hire a lawyer to evaluate your situation and options.  Start making calls first thing tomorrow.  You need to hire an attorney quickly.  Organize all of your documents before you go in to see the lawyer.  You should have all of the documents from the car purchase, subsequent notices and correspondence, proof of insurance, all of your cancelled checks from payments, etc.  I can't tell from what you wrote, but if the car has not yet been sold after the repossession you may be a Chapter ###.Best wishes.MISSOURI BARATTORNEY SEARCH FUNCTION:  ###43857.2138888889 I have been fighting with the car dealership that I was getting a car from for a months, they was stating that I am behind a payment, I did turn in all documents showing of all my payments. They are still saying am behind and refuse to send me any documents showing this information and they repossessed my vehicle without warning, what would be my next steps43844.1965277778 I was in a car accident the morning of Halloween, other driver was at fault, he was ticketed for running a stop sign. I hit him then a ditch, utility box and back onto the road. My car was not drivable and the ### police called a wrecker to have it towed, was at the lot of the towing company while I waited for his insurance to get a hold of me, it was phone tag for over a month, then when I finally did get in touch with his insurance agent and they told me Iâ€™m liable for so much of the storage of the car. Am I liable for any part of the storage of the car being that I was not at fault? They are saying I am liable for half of it?? Am I liable for any of it even though he was at fault? Thank you. 43844.6361111111 Mr. ###,It was your initial responsibility to have your car removed from the scene of the accident.  If you were injured and not able to arrange to remove your vehicle, it would be the secondary responsibility of law enforcement to have your wrecked vehicle removed.You are also potentially responsible for the entire storage ### for your car which accrued because you decided to leave the car at the tow company lot.  While the other driver's insurance company might agree to pay for the initial tow and a few days of storage, if you left the vehicle at the tow lot for an extended period of time it would not be unusual for the insurance company to deny at least partial payment.Apparently you elected not to pursue a claim through your own insurance company, which would then have pursued reimbursement from the other driver's insurance company.  Without knowing more about the situation, an attorney on this forum cannot give you a definitive opinion about the obligation of the other driver's insurance company.  An attorney on this site cannot speculate as to how a court would rule on any particular matter.While the accident itself was not your fault, leaving your vehicle at the tow lot for over a month was your choice.  The other insurance company would only be responsible for reasonable damages resulting from the negligence of its insured.  Unless you litigate your claim, it is not possible to determine if that would be a few days or a couple of week's storage, but it is not likely that it would be open-ended.  I am assuming you've already retrieved your vehicle, so that the ### is not continuing to grow.You may wish to confer with a local attorney for advice and representation, or pursue your claim through small claims court to see if ### can do better than the insurance company's offer.  Best wishes.43845.2375 I received a summons for St ### County on ###. The summons is for a car repo the plaintiff is trying to get the balance for. The court date is ###. I use to live in St ### but now reside in Florida. What is the best way to handle this summons? I am not in a position to attend court nor can a find a lawyer who can help. I do not want to neglect the court date and have my pay check garnish. What can I do?43844.7256944444 You can contact the attorney and try to arrange payments. You need to understand that just because the vehicle was repossessed doesnâ€™t eliminate the debt that you owed on the vehicle. Repossessed vehicle sales seldom generate enough to pay off the debt in full because the vehicle deprecates (loses value) faster than the loan amount amortizes (gets paid off).  As a result, the amount owed is routinely more than the value of the car. 43844.7673611111 I have NO income other than Social Security.I own NO real estate.I own NO assets except my ### $200.I think I currently owe about $###. This includes one $###.Thank you.43851.5145833333 I'm going to address a couple of other topics, in case this question closes" on the site.  (It may close ### but I am not ###00% sure).  Here are the some items you need to understand.###.  How to send "cease and desist" letters (covered in prior reply).  You do not have to send these.  Some people are fine with hanging up and using a call blocking program to block numbers on their cell phones.  If your cell phone does not have a call block function there are free programs you can download to be able to block specific phone numbers.###.  Lawsuits.  Unless there are major changes in your financial situation it does not matter if you are sued served with the petition and summons and then just let each case go to a default judgment.  There's no need to go to court or do anything else.   If you want to you could send a letter to the attorney representing the creditor in the lawsuit stating that you have no source of income except social security no assets from which a judgment can be collected and have ongoing health problems.  For small medical bills there will likely never be any lawsuits filed -- just collection letters and calls.###.  Judgments.  If you are sued and a default judgment is entered there are a couple of items you should know about.a.  Garnishment of the account where your social security is deposited.  Federal law protects your social security benefits from attachment by creditors (except for child and spousal support).  Most likely your social security benefits are already directly deposited into a checking or savings account.  Your bank or credit union is supposed to have your account flagged as containing direct-deposited social security funds.  In other words your bank should already know that the account is not subject to execution and garnishment.But if there has been a judgment entered and you get a notification that the creditor has requested a garnishment be issued to your bank you should contact the bank immediately and make sure they have marked that the account contains social security funds.  The bank should know this automatically if you have direct deposit but as a precaution you should make sure if a creditor has requested a garnishment to collect a judgment.  A bank can charge you a fee for responding to a   garnishment usually $75.(If you are one of the relatively few who still receive social security checks you should change this so that your benefits are directly deposited).b.  Examination of Judgment Debtor.  After a judgment is entered a creditor can file a motion for an order requiring you to appear in court and answer questions about your income and assets.  The papers you receive would include a Motion for Examination of Judgment Debtor and an Order to Show Cause.  Do not ignore these documents.  You do have the absolute right to appear and "take the fifth" -- asserting your fifth amendment US Constitutional rights to decline to answer any questions after your name.  In your situation it actually would not matter if you appeared in court and gave sworn answers about your income and assets.  But you must appear on the date for your "examination" or the judge can issue a bench warrant to have you taken into custody until a hearing.  This is what happens to some people who foolishly ignore the court date.You are a few steps away from even the possibility of dealing with a motion for examination of judgment debtor.  But I wanted to mention this so that you are aware of the post-judgment proceeding that does require your attention.  If you are served with a motion for examination of judgment debtor some months or years down the road it would be a good idea to make sure you know what to do by again asking an attorney.  It's also entirely possible you will never receive such a motion.If you have any questions please feel free to respond again before this question closes.  As far as your situation goes you should not spend a second worrying about the bills.  You're safe.  I hope that you have a good outcome to your health situation.  Best wishes."43855.9715277778 Ms. ###,You may or may not need to file bankruptcy.  If your income is from social security, it is protected from creditors.  Unless you have assets which could be subject to attachment after a judgment, it may not matter whether or not a judgment is entered.  Many people who contemplate bankruptcy are simply judgment proof" -- there are no wages or other assets which can be attached or garnished.  Your husband's prison status would not affect your ability to file bankruptcy.  Your first step would be to review your entire financial situation with an attorney familiar with bankruptcy but who explores other options for clients.  It is beyond the scope of this forum to review all the information necessary to determine if you truly need to file bankruptcy or not or if some strategy to protect your assets is needed and nothing more.With your health situation it may be more advisable to let unpaid bills go to collection.  Your future health expectations would also be a consideration in deciding how to proceed.You may already be "judgment proof" or can make yourself "judgment proof" with the guidance of an attorney.  An attorney can also instruct you how to send "cease and desist" letters to collectors which will stop all communication.  The attorney can either handle this for you or give you a sample letter and instructions in order to stop the phone calls and collection correspondence.  Contact after "cease and desist" notifications give you the right to collect damages under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  There are attorneys who specialize in FDCPA claims almost exclusively in the St. ### area so I presume there are some in your part of the state.Fortunately you have not even been sued yet -- and often with smaller bills you never will be sued despite the threats.  You first need to determine if it even matters if a judgment is entered against you.  I don't know if your local legal aid office provides any services with respect to debt issues.  Before you even get to the bankruptcy possibility you need to determine if you have any assets from which a judgment could be collected.  If not you just need guidance how to deal with creditors (and make them go away) and future lawsuits (if any).Try to find an attorney who does NOT only handle bankruptcy cases.  Some bankruptcy "###" push people into bankruptcy whether they need it or not.  Best wishes."43847.5104166667 Ms. ###,Your answers indicate that you have no earnings or assets from which a judgment could be collected, so it really does not matter if you are sued and judgments entered.  There would be absolutely no need to file bankruptcy.As much as anything else, you will need to stay on top of sending cease and desist letters to ### collectors.  Do not be pressured by collection calls and correspondence, which is intended to threaten and/or frighten you into making payments. Cease and desist letters should be sent I have attached a sample cease and desist letter."  You will find information about these letters and the FDCPA online.   You should do a little reading online for your own education.  The FDCPA actually does not apply to the original creditor.  So sending one of these letters to (for example) the hospital to which the ### is owed does not have any legal effect.  The law only applies to debt collectors (third-parties) but it may not hurt to send them to a persistent or annoying original creditor.  If you are still receiving services from the medical provider you may not want to alert them any earlier than necessary that you are unable to pay.You could add a line or two to the letter stating you are under medical treatment and your situation is not going to change and that you have no sources of income or assets from which a judgment could be collected.Cease and desist letters should be sent to debt collectors by certified mail return receipt.  Save a copy of each letter and the ### card when it comes back.  If you send a letter when you get a ### from the original creditor you don't need to send it certified mail since you will not be able to claim damages against the original creditor.You may want to wait until a ### goes to a collector before sending out a letter.  When you get a collection phone call first ask for the person's name company he or she is calling from name of original creditor mailing address and phone number.  If they will not provide this tell them you are requesting no further contact under the FDCPA and hang up.  There is no need to talk to them if they will not identify themselves.  Then block the number on your phone if you can.If the collector does provide name address etc. after writing this information down to use on the cease and desist letter tell the caller you are requesting no further contact under the FDCPA and are sending a formal written request tomorrow.  Then hang up.  No need to engage in discussion.  Then block the number on your phone if you can.Please let me know if this is not clear or if you have questions about what I wrote.  There are a couple of other subjects I need to mention to you but let's get this one out of the way first.  Thank you."43853.0444444444 Thank you so very muc!

You should schedule a consultation with an attorney who handles both personal and business bankruptcies to sort out the situation and review your options.A Chapter ###, so I'm pretty sure you didn't mean a Chapter 12.  Most personal bankruptcies are either Chapter 7 (fresh start) or Chapter 1### (###-###).  Some  few individuals with extremely high debts who cannot qualify for a Chapter 1### (wage earner plan) file a personal Chapter ###.A business bankruptcy is usually either Chapter 7 (liquidation), or a Chapter ###.You may need a personal bankruptcy, a business bankruptcy or both.   As I said, the first step is to meet with a good bankruptcy attorney, go over all of the details of your assets and debts, your income, and other financial information.  Your attorney will be able to analyze what is available to you in terms of bankruptcy relief.Best wishes.43850.9173611111 When filing bankruptcy, would my small business that is an sole ### LLC be filed in the same chapter ###.

First you will need the help of an attorney to establish liability since the police report does not find clear liability against Driver ###. Second, an attorney will be able to make a claim for the damages you have suffered and continue to suffer. These damages will not only include your claim for property damage but they will also include your claims for storage and towing expenses, out-of-pocket expenses, lost wages, and lost opportunity wages. 43882.8347222222 I'm a commercial truck driver owner operator.

You will need to speak with a few different lawyers to find one that meets your needs. 43852.3333333333 ###,Thanks for posting your question.  I'm so sorry you're in such a situation.  Hopefully, I can point you in the right direction.  If you live in ### County, you're subject to the Western District of Missouri federal Court jurisdiction.  Handling a bankruptcy pro se (without an attorney) can sometimes be a recipe for disaster.  The Courts and their employees are not allowed to give you any advice, and you're held to the same standards as an attorney.  Please see the Bankruptcy FAQs from the Western District of Missouri here:  https://www.mow.uscourts.gov/bankruptcy/faq  One of those questions is about handling the case pro se, and another is about where you can get the necessary bankruptcy forms.Unfortunately, no one is going to be able to give you step by step guidance as to what to do as that would take more time than an attorney would spend actually representing you on the case.  I would suggest that you look at the following websites to see if you can get a pro bono attorney to represent you and handle your bankruptcy:###/https://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=43918That would be the route I'd suggest.  If you have any follow up questions, please don't hesitate to get back to me.

It is not for seeking legal assistance or to find a lawyer to hire.  I cannot find a legal question to answer in what you posted.  Most likely your situation will resolve itself in the near future and you probably just need to be patient.I would caution you about cashing" out your 401(k) account and you should make sure you are aware of the tax consequences removal of the funds.  You may be referring to rolling the account into an existing or new self-directed or other IRA.  This is usually the correct financial move with retirement funds.  Your should be certain that you are properly handling the disposition of the 401(k) funds.  If you are looking for an attorney to hire to assist you the Missouri Bar does have an attorney search function here:  http://www.mobar.org/LawyerSearch.aspxHowever the ABA Free Legal Answers site is not for finding an attorney nor can an attorney contacted on this forum call you or your former employer.

I wish I had a brighter, better answer.   Maybe someone else can come up with a better idea.   43858.9694444444 Dear Ms. McGowen,You hit a stationary vehicle, which makes the collision your fault.  It's virtually impossible to prove that all of the damage to the other vehicle was already there, and that you caused no damage.  You would need before and after photos, and before and after estimates for the repairs.  While it is certainly possible that the owner of the other car was overcompensated, you will not be able to establish a fraudulent claim.  The overpayment you believe was made would not lower your insurance premium, even if you caused only a $###.It sounds like you are under the mistaken impression that your rate increase was due to the payment of a minor claim ($###) as opposed to the fact that you negligently backed into the other vehicle.  I would suggest you discuss this with your insurance agent, as it probably makes no difference if you did $### $###.  Your insurance company paid what it believed was prudent to settle the claim as opposed to the cost to defend the claim with unknown results.  This is standard operating procedure, and $###.I'd suggest first discussing your concerns with your insurance agent so that you can better understand how and why the claim was settled for $###, and the actual effect of simply the accident on your insurance premium.  There would seem to be nothing for your insurance company to work with you" about nor any reason to see an attorney.   An attorney would likely only explain what an insurance agent would tell you but he or she would not have access to all of the information in the possession of your insurance company.   If you want to spend the money and would feel better paying for an attorney consultation I would encourage you to do so.Best wishes on your pregnancy.  Thank you."43859.9527777778 I was involved in an auto accident back in September of 20###9. This happened in a parking lot at a preschool. I was backing out of my parking space to leave the school and there was a car parked directly behind me on a curb in a no-parking Zone. I have no damage to my vehicle whatsoever and the other person had significant prior damage to theirs. we went to our local police station and filed a report and they took pictures of both vehicles and sent it to my insurance. Then we waited on a response from my insurance to see what the adjuster had found. husband and I were told by phone through our insurance company that nothing was processed and nothing went through and it would be dropped. Now our insurance company sent us a letter to increase our premium. Come to find out there was a payout to the other party of $###,###. The prior damages were very significant and I have no damage to my vehicle. The other party claimed that all the damage was from me. He also personally asked me for $###,###. But my insurance company has told me they have no written report that was sent to them, just pictures. They said that it does not matter that he was parked in a no-parking Zone. The adjuster approved his claim and now my insurance has gone up, they are not willing to work with me. What kind of lawyer do I need for the situation and what steps need to be taken? I am also ###'s put a lot of stress on me. 43859.7013888889 ###,Thanks for posting your question.  I'm glad to try to point you in the right direction.That's a strange situation - - I have not heard of a hospital doing that before.  No one can obligate you on a loan that you haven't agreed to, signed on, or consented to.  You need to ask the loan company why you're obligated to pay and tell them you never entered into the loan or signed anything.  You should also ask the hospital the same thing.I imagine there could have been some paperwork with the hospital that you signed where in small print it said that you agree to have the hospital take out a loan for you and you agree to sign the loan papers, but I haven't seen that either.  I'd ask the hospital if you signed anything regarding the loan and tell them you want copies.Bottom line is that if you didn't sign anything or otherwise consent to this loan, they should not be able to take out a loan in your name and obligate you to pay the loan company.I hope this helps.  Don't hesitate to get back to me if you have any follow-up questions.###43860.7284722222 Can a hospital set up a loan, with a bank, for the amount you owe them after your insurance pays their part, with out you signing for the loan? 43860.0604166667 Dear Mr. Zlotopolski,As the user agreement for this site states, questions regarding criminal matters are not permitted.  You can contact law enforcement if you wish to try to report this as a crime.  However most likely you will be told that it is a civil matter.Hopefully you have a written agreement and/or other evidence to support the obligation to pay you back for what in essence was a personal loan.  From what you wrote, you were not buying the vehicle nor was the vehicle supposed to be titled in your name..  Apparently you were not going to be a lienholder on the title.In effect you have a verbal contract for a loan.  You agreed to pay a third party for the van for ###.  ### agreed to repay you $###.   Make sure to retain all documents, including e-mail, which evidence the transaction and the repayment obligation.  Any admission you can still obtain from ###, perhaps via e-mail or recording, would be helpful evidence in court.The amount of money involved would likely not make it worthwhile to hire an attorney to file suit against ###, so small claims court would seem to be your better option.   A small claims court brochure (from 2011) can be found here:  ###St. ### Co. small claims court pamphlet:  https://www.st###co.com/Portals/8/docs/Document%20Library/circuit%20court/circuit%20court%20pages/SmallClaimsPamphlet2011.pdfIf the suit is to be filed in ### County, forms and possibly other information should be available from the court clerk.Best wishes.43861.0659722222 From what I've read about the small claims court, even if I do get a ruling against him, Then it is still up to me to try to collect from him.43861.175 I paid for a vehicle by check, for some one I though was a friend.
