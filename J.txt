I suggest that you write a letter to the attorney for the boy and tell him that you do not oppose the emancipation and will not appear at the hearing.

If you don't already, you should have those documents for your mother because according to HIPPA your mother would not have access to your information if you ended up in the hospital without her going to court first and getting guardianship which can take many months.  If you want your step father to adopt you, you can go through the court process and have that completed and have the birth certificate changed at that point.  As I stated in your last request, it really isn't necessary for any reason other than you want him off of it and there are legal hoops you have to go through to have that happen.

We are trying to schedule parenting classes (her mother finds this to be a stupid" idea) and she is in a bad predicament.

If they are just something that the Mom ### up that may not be valid.  On the other hand if it's some type of court order you'd have to take a close look at it to see what it is.I think your best bet is to file a PETITION FOR GUARDIANSHIP in order to get a Guardianship over him.  A guardianship strips any rights from the parents (the biological father in this case) and vests it with you until his is ###.  That will allow you to enroll him in school and get medical care for him etc.  I think that's the right way to go.  Unfortunately Guardianships are very complicated actions that you will need an attorney for.  It really isn't set up to be something you can do on your own.  As a result I'd strongly suggest that you speak to a local attorney regarding this matter.

While I'm not sure whether they would directly handle an emancipation proceeding, I'm sure they would be able to at a minimum put your friend in contact with someone who could assist, if that is something she would like to pursue.I do note that the emancipation legal process, in the ordinary course, likely does take a fair bit of time (i.e., at least a couple of months) and can be rather complicated.  Your friend, ideally with the assistance of a lawyer representing her, would need to properly complete and file a petition, have the petition served on her parents, which they have ###, and at the hearing demonstrate, through the presentation of evidence, that emancipation is in her best interests.  To make this determination the court would look at, among other things, (i) her ability to function as an adult, (ii) whether she is employed, (iii) the stability of her living arrangement, (iv) the extent of her family issues and (v) the quality of her parental support.  Before ruling, the judge could require that your friend be examined by mental and physical health experts or order that a juvenile court counselor or county department further investigate any allegations made at the hearing by your friend or her parents.  Here is a link to the University of North Carolina School of Government's website that includes, among other things, some more background on the emancipation process, what it does and does not do and the various requirements: https://civil.sog.unc.edu/juvenile-emancipations/.Your friend could also make a report to North Carolina Child Protection Services and seek their assistance with resolving any issues.

What forms do we need to file? Thanks again!44032.7902777778 There's no form to do what you would like to do.  You're going to need an attorney to determine if there is any basis to try to undo what has already happened.  Apparently there was a deadline to contest the termination of child support, which passed.  You also indicate there was a medical discharge, which would indicate that there was an ### into the national guard.  If child support was terminated by a court or administrative order or by operation of law, it terminates forever. Again, I suggest you wife needs to meet with a local family law attorney to determine if there is any possible basis to try to restore the support obligation.   Restoration is not likely, but your wife is going to need to have an attorney thoroughly review the factual history and documents to get a definitive opinion.  This is not something you can attempt without an attorney, and it may well not be possible with an attorney. Without going over all the related documents regarding both the termination of the support obligation and the national guard, there's no way any attorney on this site can give you a final opinion.  It's time to consult with an attorney. Best wishes.44032.8298611111 Unfortunately if there has already been a final court judgment that the support obligation has ended, it is extremely unlikely that it can be reinstated.  It certainly would be worth a consultation with a good local family law attorney to go over the paperwork and see if there is any creative basis to pursue this.  However once the court entered a judgment that the child was emancipated and no longer entitled to parental support, it is almost always a final determination.If your wife has not already done so, it will be well worth it to have the interest calculated on the existing support arrearage.  Delinquent support accrues ###% per month simple interest on the unpaid balance at the end of the month.  So a $50,### $###.  Missouri law provides that the interest on delinquent support is considered support.  See https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=454.520&bid=25266&hl=In order to have FSD add the accrued interest to the support debt, your wife will need to have the interest calculated.  A payment history and interest calculation, together with an affidavit, will need to be filed with the court.  FSD will required a filed copy and your wife will still probably have to push to get FSD to update its records.  The interest owed may well exceed the future years of support until the child turns 2###.

In order to keep the judgment collectible, it may (or may not) be necessary to file to revive the judgment.  Depending on the payment history, your wife might be required to file to revive the judgment.

I'm glad to try to help out.  You really didn't ask a question in your post, but I'm guessing you're asking what you can do.  I'd suggest that you take a look at your custody judgment.  If it says you pay $XX of child support for ### $XX amount for ###, you can file a Motion to Terminate support on your oldest son.  Your Court should have forms for you to do this on your own (I'm assuming the other son you mentioned is younger and you still owe support on him).  If there is not a separate figure stated for just ###, you're going to have to file a Motion to terminate and a Motion to Modify child support to get the amount recalculated and reduced.  These can be somewhat complicated actions, and I'd suggest that you sit down and have an attorney review your judgment and that give you advice on what your next step should be.If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reply to this message.

Since you've already indicated the mother is not in agreement, the minor's parents would not be commencing a court action.Your girlfriend would need to retain an attorney for advice and representation.  You should also confer with an attorney because your actions could be construed as a criminal offense for enticing a minor from parental custody. Thank you.44085.8194444444 Hello Mr. Rolf,There is a statute of limitations for support.  Basically, it is ten years.  Of course, the child support obligation continued to accrue each month until all your children became emancipated.  Thus, your obligation is probably not barred by the statute of limitations.44086.8048611111 short version,  haven't got to see kids in over ###, changed jobs never heard any more about child support,  children contacted me and invited me to wedding,  now I have gotten a letter for back child support in the about of ###, Is there a statute of limitations 44086.5201388889 Dear Ms. Pace,There are two distinct issues in your question.Whether or not child support is still due is governed by Section ###.###, which in part states: 5.  If when a child reaches age eighteen, the child is enrolled in and attending a secondary school program of instruction, the parental support obligation shall continue, if the child continues to attend and ### toward completion of said program, until the child completes such program or reaches age twenty-one, whichever first occurs.  If the child is enrolled in an institution of vocational or higher education not later than October first following graduation from a secondary school or completion of a graduation equivalence degree program and so long as the child enrolls for and completes at least twelve hours of credit each semester, not including the summer semester, at an institution of vocational or higher education and achieves grades sufficient to reenroll at such institution, the parental support obligation shall continue until the child completes his or her education, or until the child reaches the age of twenty-one, whichever first occurs.  To remain eligible for such continued parental support, at the beginning of each semester the child shall submit to each parent a transcript or similar official document provided by the institution of vocational or higher education which includes the courses the child is enrolled in and has completed for each ###, the grades and credits received for each such course, and an official document from the institution listing the courses which the child is enrolled in for the upcoming ### and the number of credits for each such course.  When enrolled in at least twelve credit hours, if the child receives failing grades in half or more of his or her courseload in any one semester, payment of child support may be ###inated and shall not be eligible for reinstatement.  Upon request for notification of the child's grades by the noncustodial parent, the child shall produce the required documents to the noncustodial parent within thirty days of receipt of grades from the education institution.  If the child fails to produce the required documents, payment of child support may ###inate without the accrual of any child support arrearage and shall not be eligible for reinstatement.  If the circumstances of the child manifestly dictate, the court may waive the October first deadline for enrollment required by this subsection.  If the child is enrolled in such an institution, the child or parent obligated to pay support may petition the court to amend the order to direct the obligated parent to make the payments directly to the child.  As used in this section, an institution of vocational education" means any postsecondary training or schooling for which the student is assessed a fee and attends classes regularly.  "Higher education" means any community college college or university at which the child attends classes regularly.  A child who has been diagnosed with a developmental disability as defined in section 630.005 or whose physical disability or diagnosed health problem limits the child's ability to carry the number of credit hours prescribed in this subsection shall remain eligible for child support so long as such child is enrolled in and attending an institution of vocational or higher education and the child continues to meet the other requirements of this subsection.  A child who is employed at least fifteen hours per week during the semester may take as few as nine credit hours per semester and remain eligible for child support so long as all other requirements of this subsection are complied with.It's not possible for an attorney on this forum to analyze your child's school attendance records courses transcripts etc. and whether or not the child sent these documents in a timely manner.  This is also difficult because the child is not in a traditional college but a vocational   education cosmetology program.I very much doubt that what the father is stating is correct but you need to sit down with a local family law attorney and go over all  paperwork.  A motion for contempt may be an appropriate remedy.  The father does not get to make a unilateral de###ination of his legal obligations.IF (and I stress IF) the obligation to pay support is de###ined to have ###inated your modification judgment does not expressly state that the obligation to pay college expenses ###inates concurrently with ###ination of the support obligation.  You may have a contractual agreement for the payment of college expenses which survives the end of the support obligation -- or perhaps it does not.  There may be guidance in the original decree as this or evidence of the intent at the time.  The de###ination of this issue would likely vary from judge to judge.  The modification agreement/order may be construed against the party who drafted it.  However I am just speculating.I can only suggest you confer with either the attorney who handled your modification or another good family law attorney go over all of the documents involved the school documents your child sent and the proof of mailing or service etc.  Your attorney can give you his or her opinion and options.Best wishes."44150.2520833333 Is the non-custodial parent allowed to stop child support and college expense and living expense payments if he believes he did not receive proper notice of completion  date of first part of schooling and grade reports?  Can I file contempt of court?  Is he still obligated?  I have a record of all updates sent to non-custodial parent as received from the school.  The child's documents and completion dates were given as I received them from school and they had been delayed due to Covid.  Completion dates were extended as well.  She still has the testing portion for her boards to complete and I did let the non-custodial parent know those were completed and is due to take second portion in ###20.  My current husband and I were also diagnosed with Covid during this time frame so I may have been a little late getting some information to the non- custodial parent.  Non-custodial parent has also received all information for second part of program at a different school and refuses to pay and is threatening that if I do not agree that child is emancipated he will file for me to have to pay all of the child support back from that time frame and will be released from paying any and all college costs. non-custodial parent also owes for ###. He is ordered to pay ###.###, says he does not owe due to him feeling like he was not provided documents in a timely manner.The order reads:Father and Mother shall each pay 50% of the cost for college for  the minor child.  Cost shall include:  tuition, fees, books, laboratory, activity fees, costs for room and board, cost of personal computerEach parents portion of college costs as defined herein shall be paid by each parent within ###.  44139.93125 Hi ###It is pretty hard to get child support arrearages waived or reduced, especially if the court has already issued an order about how much is past due and how it is to be paid. That being said, the balance due can be reduced in certain circumstances. For instance, if your ex was not honest when she told the court how much was due, then you may be able to get the amount reduced. From your question, it sounds like your arrangement was that the child support was only due while the children were in school and not after they dropped out and that your wife did not inform the court that they had dropped out.Another fact in your favor is that the children are now emancipated and so it will not cause harm to them if the amount due is reduced. In any event, it will be tough to get the amount reduced so my advice would be to consult a family law attorney in your area, give them the facts and get their opinion as to whether your case is worth pursuing. I hope this was helpful.###44206.5861111111 I owe my ex wife child support of fifty thousand dollars. Can I get this lowered to a normal amount.I have paid over fourth grand already to the state of mo. I was incarcerated and unable to pay when the courts set my support at eleven hundred a month. The children are married and have families of there own so I feel I have fulfill my obligation and should have it reduced or lowered to reasonable amount. The children dropped out of school at sixteen so that alone should of stopped the support but it carried on for two more years. That alone would be several thousand dollars to be removed. Can I file charges against the mother for not reporting the children as out of school 44205.9520833333 Recently, my ###-Domestic Violence against his step-father pending.  During the first hearing, the judge asked if we had the financial ability to hire an attorney for our son.  I answered no, and the judge proceeded to ask about the incomes in the house.  I make enough to provide for my son and not much else.  My husband, who has not legally or financially adopted my son, makes a bit more than I do, but is overburdened by significant debt (Student Loans, Mortgage, etc.).The judge advised us that my husband's income was required to be included in the calculation and that we were not eligible for a public defender.  Despite this ruling, we do not have the discretionary income to afford an attorney and I am worried about the consequences of showing up to the next hearing still without legal representation.My Question is:Am I required to provide my son with an attorney for his charges?Is it correct that my husband's income is included in the calculation disqualifying us from being assigned a public defender?Thanks in advance,--Worried Mom44309.6090277778 You aren't permitted to ask criminal law questions here, only civil.44313.5770833333 My mother often has alway been violent when she gets mad. She and her husband barged in my room and were taking my things down from the room they gave me, screaming that they wanted me to leave for no reason. I had no provoked them to do what they were doing and they had no former conversation with me to inform me on what was going on. She got violent with me and started trying to fight me. Mind you I have never put my hands on anyone and never had a record, was and is a good student and am in college as of right now to become a Nurse. So its frustrating to have your own mother call the cops on you for something I was defending myself against and never intentionally tried to hurt her. She has even went as far as throwing my clothing outside of our old condo because she was mad and has busted my lip and done so much horribly intentionally painful things to me. When she pulled me hair because I was trying to escape the room and she kept trying to fight and yell and argue I told her to go and was trying to make my way out of the room in which she was in front of the doorway. So she started fighting me with her husband there and I remember him directly saying not to fight me. But he never pulled her off of me as I wasn't surprised for. HE was the same person who would inappropriately try to touch me and then say he was just playing" and often times would tell me not to tell my mother. He never once treated as his child or cared/respected me as his own. So when he didn't defend me or try to protect me or just stood back like it wasn't his problem. I was just so hurt that I got stuck with them. I could've left to go to my aunts months ago and I tried to see the good in them. I just want to know if there is any legal help I can get.

We learned that my ### mother contacts CPS and stated that their son told them he was outside with the babies (when he was not) and that they were playing outside in the street for a long time. This was not true. Not only that... she as a mandated reported decided to report anonymously which I thought you were required to report under your name. Is this true? so when they come back they interviewed him and he stated what really happened and then later admitted he did make some things up but that his mother had added things in the report that he definitely never said. We decided to record this conversation because we feel we'd need this for court. He says she told CPS that he was alone outside with the babies while we were in our bedroom. We never went to the bedroom we went from the door to the back door. We also made sure to screenshot the time that he had gotten off the phone with his friends because during the time we were outside he was in his room on FaceTime with his cousins.My first question is is this Neglect or even gross neglect by PA definition?

For that I am very sorry. Nebraska is unique state in that you are a â€œminorâ€ until the age of 19. However, Nebraska law does allow for you to assume adult responsibilities at age ###. For example you can enter in contracts for necessities such as signing a lease or obtaining utilities. Additionally the law allows you to consent for certain types of medical treatment. From the standpoint that your father orders you to come home, I believe that he would have a hard time getting someone with authority such as DHHS or law enforcement to force you to go back and live in his home. This is because of your current age of ###. Of course once you turn 19, none of this will no longer be an issue With that being said and knowing you donâ€™t necessarily have to return home to your fathers, I would suggest you find a trusted adult to help guide you through what would be your best steps to take to establish your independence and move forward with your life. It might involve reconciling with one of your parents, it might look like working full time, renting an apartment and moving forward independently. There are some legal remedies for you to get your personal belongings like your clothes if going about it on your own is your choice. Additionally, a lot of agencies have assistance programs you could go to for a variety of services like getting your own place, counseling, getting new personal belongings etc. One personal tip, never close the door on your parents, often time and reflection can change a persons position and perhaps this may be the case with your mom and/or dad. ###43408.9277777778 hello, I am ###.

Please contact your childâ€™s attorney. 43550.6784722222 Hello,First I would advise both you and your son to contact the probation office immediately. If you haven't already. You need to speak with the Probation Officer and clarify that your son is being ###. Secondly, did the Dept of Ed allow the ### exemption? The School should have also had worked with the Dept of Ed to allow the ### exemption. That information is important for the probation office as well. As far as you personally getting in trouble for ### while your son is on probation - that is also possible because it is written in the law to allow for punishment of parents who knowingly keep their children out of school.However, as mentioned it is important to make sure the county attorney and probation know that you requested the ### exemption AND who you were working with at the school. The problem here appears to be no contact with the probation office. If there was an ### and the recommendations were court-ordered then you should have been aware of what was required. You have to be ### and keep trying to contact probation because they are hard to get in touch with (just like HHS).....too few workers and too many cases.Lastly, make sure you and your son attend the court hearing on the 9th. Take copies of any emails or correspondence you have regarding the ### exemption and who you contacted. Along with a school contact as well. There are no guarantees about detention, however, you need to absolutely either call or go in to the probation office and make sure probation has the correct information and have given you the correct information as well. Don't be afraid to ask probation questions. If you are ### in contacting both probation and county attorney then your son should be allowed to continue with his ###.43746.0361111111 My ###. He started probation in July. Since school has started this year he has attended ###. He doesnâ€™t feel comfortable in the high school. The only other options are the learning center (wait list) and catholic school (too expensive). I decided as his parent to homeschool him which started at the end of September. We received a motion to revoke probation due to him not attending school. In the letter it states he missed an appointment with his PO however we never received the notice because they sent it to the wrong mailing address. Also it states he completed his ### which recommended he attend individual therapy sessions. We were never made aware of this either. My son will be ###. Will they send him to a juvenile detention center for this until heâ€™s ###? Or what could possibly happen? And can I get in legal trouble for dec###ng to homeschool him while heâ€™s on truancy probation? I submitted the exemption paperwork to the Nebraska Board of Education and he has been doing an online high school diploma program. I felt like it was in the best interest of him to continue his education at home since he has issues going to a public school. 43746.0097222222 Back when I was at my hearing to ask if am guilty or not, I was force by my guardian to plead guilty or she would physical hurt me and had me lie to the judge to say I wasnâ€™t getting threatened.how do I ask for appeal?43751.7229166667 Hello,I need more facts to answer your question properly. For instance, I would need to know what you were charged with? You state this is in juvenile court. Was this an abuse and neglect case or are you the juvenile that was charged with a criminal law violation? Or was it a truancy issue (missing school)? Please tell me why you were in court and answer those questions for me and I will be able to advise you on how to appeal. Thanks.43751.7395833333 Hello,Not knowing specifically what charges were filed it is difficult to give advice regarding making a plea. The violations should be listed on the ticket with a statute number. As to her pleading guilty - it is never advisable to outright plead guilty at the first appearance. Although the county attorney may make an offer of a lesser charge that is not always guaranteed. Sometimes the county attorney will offer diversion or a stop class if the juvenile is eligible. It would be advisable to check that out prior to the first court appearance. While it is easy to plead guilty and pay the fine, that sometimes leads to complications with future employment and college applications (depending on the charge). It's good that you have asked for advice prior to appearing in court, and ultimately it is going to be your daughter that should make the final decision regarding how she wants to plead. If you want to discuss this further prior to court don't hesitate to respond. Thanks!43756.7569444444 I apologize for the late reply and thanks for the clarification.I am pasting links from the Nebraska Supreme Court website that you may find helpful. I am also pasting the ### schedule that most prosecutor's offices follow. The charge of misuse of learner's permit is probably what is preventing your daughter from being eligible for diversion. Although if your daughter had her ### operator's permit I believe that would allow for diversion.I would be able to look up your daughter's case in the Justice" database if you would give me her last name and first name initial. The violation of learner's permit is a class ###. That charge could carry the highest penalty (up to a $###). Depending on the Judge (I cannot say how lenient or restrictive the ### county judges will be) they may impose a fine only or restriction of driving privileges. It depends on the county attorney as well - because the county attorney may request a penalty greater or lesser than what is recommended by law. I would also recommend contacting the Department of Motor Vehicles and asking what effect pleading guilty to the offense and/or being convicted of the offense would have upon your daughter's ability to get her license.I'm happy to help further as needed.###https://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=60-4123###"43756.9611111111 My ### ###rd for ###.  Running a red light, driving after curfew and not having an adult in the car.  Someone mentioned her pleading not guilty but that seems strange to me. My question is, if she goes in and pleads guilty will that be okay?  I'm sure they'll be a fine or whatever but I don't think she would face jail time with these charges but I don't know?? This is her first time in trouble with the law and we're not sure if we can just plea or if we need an attorney? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!### ###43756.7465277778 My daughters name is ### ###. DOB: ###. 43759.5048611111 Thank you for that information. After looking at her ticket, the violation of learner's permit is charged under Statute Â§### - that is an infraction. The 1st charge is disobey traffic control device (also an infraction) which is normally a ### fine of $25. The 2nd charge is no license on person, which in most other jurisdictions is a $###.All told, if the county attorney would work with you they would probably accept payment of fine upon a plea of guilty. I am confused because normally all three of these charges are ### and do not require a court appearance, although the officer checked the box that your daughter MUST appear in court. Yet below that fills in the blank that she may pay a fine of $###" (that I cannot make out) but I believe those are usually $###. Again it is up to your daughter whether or not to outright plead guilty. I will also reiterate that this may have implications on her getting her license later on so be aware of that possibility. My best advice is to have your daughter call the county attorney and have her ask if she pleads guilty and pays a fine if they would make her an offer or reduce one of the charges. If you wait and show up to court on the ### you may also have your daughter ask for the same kind of plea deal. However court days are crazy busy and often times county attorney's don't have time to speak with you prior to court. But they normally will if they think your daughter will offer to pay a fine and costs and plead guilty. I hope that helps. If you need anything further I would be happy to help!"43759.625 Thank you so much.  You have helped a great deal already. I do not have a ticket number but the charges are: Misuse of ### permit, violated traffic control device and no license on person.  Does that help at all? I called the county attorney and she is not eligible for diversion or stop class. Any other help would be appreciated if you can with this additional information.

I would need some clarifying information. The first would be do you have a case number? Is your daughter a ### of the state and/or have your parental rights been relinquished or terminated? As to your attorney â€“ is this a court appointed attorney? Usually if you have a court appointed attorney it is more difficult to retain new legal counsel because you would have to hire your own attorney. But it does depend on the circumstances. Please get me that clarifying information and I will be able to assist you further. Thank you!43917.6548611111 I found the case: D### 17 - ### - the last hearing was held ###. Were you at that hearing? The court is listing your mailing address as ### KS. Which I assume is incorrect since you are saying you live in ### County ###. Your attor###y's name was ### Zitek and her pho### # is ###-###. But it appears that she tried to withdraw as your attor###y at the beginning of the case, because she stated she had no contact with you since 2018. However, she is still appearing at court hearings. Your daughter is under a guardianship - do you have any contact with ### or the guardian ad litem? When is the last time you had any contact with your daughter? Typically with cases such as this - your attor###y ###eds to sit down with you and go over the case plan and court report. And/or ### ###eds to have a meeting with you to discuss your case plan goals. What has happe###d here is that since your daughter is under guardianship and reunification is no longer the court ordered plan, then you as the parent do not have any goals to fulfill. What you would ###ed to do is contact your attor###y and request that you desire reunification with your daughter. What ### is saying in the last court order is that they documented unsuccessful efforts at perma###ncy goals. And, rather than moving to terminate your parental rights, they just placed your daughter in what they felt was a suitable placement. You should also request a copy of any reports on your daughter - and ask that you remain involved in her life, even if you do not live together, you still have parental rights intact. The ###xt court hearing is set for ###th at 2:###.m. Is there other information that you want that I can help you obtain? 43917.9125 I hope I put the right information ###eded.

They have my address but I'm not notified of court dates, or involved in any details. Refused to help me get to ### for visits. I have a family coach. I have professional people here who can say I'm doing everything I'm supposed too. The court said I'm not. How do I prove to the court I'm doing what I'm supposed to? How can I prove I'm taking my medication? How do I get a ###w attor###y? How can they send my daughter half way across the country? I'm on disability but they say I have to go to work.

My rights were not taken away. Reunification was the goal they decided to change that to independent living. Please I'm not trying to not take responsibility but I promise you I'm doing everything I have ever been asked to do. I have jumped through every hoop. My daughter is suffering because of this.

I think I answered all your questions.43917.7916666667 Sorry I forgot. Is there a probono attorney service or some place that can take my case? Is there something in the court report that says exactly what I didn't do? We keep getting different answers from the caseworker. And the new GAL does not wish to speak with me at this time. Also since she has been in ### I have never been included in team meeting and was even told that it made the foster mother uncomfortable so there for I could not be there by phone. I have that in email. I have emails where I asked for ###. It took a therapist at ### to get me that visit. I wish I could tell you the whole story. There is so much to this case. I'm not out to talk bad about people but honestly they have destroyed my daughter's life. 43918.2527777778 Try looking at this website: ###/Unfortunately, due to the COVID virus scare, the self-help desks are closed. Otherwise I would recommend you try going in person to a self-help center. You could try to contact ### to get a copy of the ### court report and case plan. Although I believe all of their offices are shut down right now as well. Maybe you could try having your mental health practitioner contact ###? It's worth a shot - they should have some contacts they'd be able to reach out to on your behalf. One other resource is the foster care review board - https://fcro.nebraska.gov/#Since your daughter has been in out of home care for so long - they should be involved. You could try and reach out to them as well. Additionally, as far as your attorney goes, it's a long shot but maybe try calling the ### County Public Defender's office.

Why did the police bring the father to your house?I am pasting the link from the Nebraska Supreme Court to the self-help portion of filing for custody. There are detailed instructions on what is needed in order to file a complaint/petition. If child support has already been established - that would make this case more complicated. I recommend reading through these directions and if you cannot afford an attorney - starting the process by gathering the necessary information.

And in the likely event the police come to the door, the residents do not need to allow the police into the residence without a warrant. They should turn around an walk away from that situation as the police are trained not to enter a residence without permission from a resident or a search warrant.

The father has a lawyer. I sent a notice of appeal and was referred to the probono appeal program. Shortly after this decision, the child went into rehab for opioid dependence. legal project said this is a significant change. I petitioned for a modification.  The child also has mental health issues that were also testified to in the original trial. The father was originally prose and motioned for a dismissal.  The judge did not grant it and scheduled a trial. He hired the attorney days before the trial. I brought witnesses and even started my opening statement.  His attorneys opening statement was to request it get dismissed because I didn't write something on the original motion about constructive vs. economic emancipation.  It looked ok to me and I told the judge I wasn't a lawyer but the words could be interpreted to say the opioid dependence was a change of circumstances for both constructive and economic emancipation. The judge seemed angry and dismissed it, in the beginning of the trial.  The probono appeal program couldn't find a volunteer. does this make my appeal dead in the water? if so, what else can be done to advocate for more strict rules on ### emancipation?  this judge wrote in his summary the child didn't seem interested, but also said the father didn't take responsibility for his actions in distancing himself from his kids.  the childs substance abuse and disabilities were completely ignored.  Since I cant afford to appeal, this is a case for others to reference, and he just changed the law from refusal of any and all contact to doesn't seem interested. Is it legal for this judge to allow a trial to start and then just dismiss it?  Do I have any recourse in this matter?  I suspect if I appeal to the family court that judge will not be favorable.

Is there any statues/case law that helps distinguish the two?43928.0402777778 As I said before, I doubt that the domestic partnership situation would be construed to mean emancipated,  all by itself. 43928.8611111111 I am trying to argue that as a parent, i am not required to pay child support as the child is emancipated because they are in a domestic partnership.43928.8291666667 I'm unaware of any statute nor cases that have addressed this issue. However, I have not nor will not be researching this issue. I think you would want to focus on the issue of emancipation which means that the child is supporting or capable of supporting themselves or is being supported by the domestic partner.  This focus would simply be on the practicality of the situation â€“ does the child need parental support to provide for his or her necessities?  If not, you can make the case that the child is emancipated in ### court to terminate a support obligation. If the child is financially exposed and child support obligation is likely to be enforced. Good luck.43928.5125 One of the reasons for any child support obligation is to prevent the child from having to be on welfare.  What are you trying to do here? Are you trying to get out from under a child support obligation?  it is going to be difficult to convince a judge to terminate a child support obligation when the child is receiving welfare.43928.6944444444 Under any circumstances, is a child  considered to be legally or constructively emancipated from their parents if they are in a domestic partnership in NY if they are under the age of 21 ?Typically, a child legally married or in the armed forces is considered emancipated, but what about when it comes to a domestic partnership when child support is involved?

I was told by her attorney they werent offering her diversion because the school called and said they were having problems with her already, it was still summer time and the attorney said it must have been something she had done the previous school year" can they punish her for something that happened in the past? Next question My daughters probation officer wanted my daughter to have a co-occurring evaluation done which my daughter lied on the entire evaluation and the counselor who was ### licensed twisted everything I said and she twisted several things my daughter said and they want to send my daughter to a group home out of state because of this evaluation saying that my daughter has a moderate alcohol abuse problem and a mild marijuana abuse problem and a sever tabbacco abuse problem. My daughter I know this sounds weird but my daughter is with me besides when she is at school ###% of the time.

If you aren't working, I'm not sure how you would sign a lease and pay the deposit let alone prove to the court that you can live apart from your parent without support.In Nebraska, you are a minor until you are 19. Realistically, your parents can require you to stay in the home. They can report you missing, but missing person reports are not active investigations. Generally, something is done only when there is an encounter with police or when a background check is run (for employment, for example). 44236.0708333333 I would like to know what is the legal age in ###, ###braska for and adult-teen to move out of o###â€™s parents house?

Thank you! ### ### 44012.6916666667 You cannot involuntarily emancipate a minor in New York State. However, under case law from the State's courts, a minor may be constructively emancipated from his/her parents if he/she leaves the parents' home because he/she does not want to abide by the parents' rules, despite their requests that the minor not do so and despite their requests that the minor return to the home.  Evidence that the minor left the home â€“ i.e., was not forced out of the home â€“ despite the parent clearly telling the child that the parent did not want the child to leave, but only to abide by rules that are reasonable and appropriate to protect the minor's welfare - and has refused to return to the home despite the parents' requests that he/she do so should result in a court order finding the minor to be constructively emancipated and, therefore, the parents to be alleviated of any obligation to provide for the minor's support.For example, in one case a County Family Court dismissed a petition filed by the County Department of Social Services to require a parent to pay the County child support, given its provision of welfare and other benefits to the minor.  The court found that the evidence demonstrated that the minor in that case had voluntarily left the parents' home left the home because he did not want to have to continue following the parents' rules, including rules on internet access, ###, homework, and similar matters, and he did so despite the parents' requests that he not leave the home.  The evidence also showed that the minor had neglected to return to the home despite the parents' requests that he do so.  The following established precedent, the Court ruled that the minor was constructively emancipated and the parents were, therefore, relieved of any obligation to provide support. Therefore, dismissed the action.  A redacted copy of this decision is attached and it explains the law on this issue extremely well. You should also know that, under New York law, a parent is required to provide his/her child with financial support and care until the child reaches the age of 21, unless the child first becomes emancipated. New York law specifies the circumstances under which a minor may become emancipated, and they include joining the military, getting married, becoming constructively emancipated, among others. A minor who becomes emancipated â€“ constructively or otherwise â€“ is no longer entitled to financial support from his/her parents and is considered an adult.In the circumstances you describe, you cannot involuntarily emancipate your daughter.  However, if she chooses to leave your home, despite your requests that she not do so, but rather just follow the rules of the home, and if she stays out of the home despite you telling her she is welcome to come home again, but she must follow the rules, she will be deemed constructively emancipated. 44012.7333333333 my son is ### ###. i am non custodial parent and pay support every month. thing is my son and his mom haven't been living together for about ###. she left ny ###-###. she gets the support that i pay every month and my son says he doesn't get any of it nor does the people he lives with--his friends parents. is this legal for his mom to collect support when she doesn't live in ny and hasn't lived with my son for years. also can my son be emancipated he has a job and housing and supports himself. thank you44214.6930555556 Evelyn,As explained below, it appears that you are emancipated from your parents. Assuming that to be the case, your emancipation is a fact, regardless of whether a court has issued a decision that acknowledges it to be the case. A court order is, invariably, something that occurs after the fact and simply states a finding of whether such a condition exists. A minor's emancipation, however, was a reality before any court order is issued.  Below, I will explain the support requirement, the emancipation issue, and provide some guidance on how to proceed.    As a general rule, parents are legally obligated to support their children until they reached the age of 21. (See, e.g., Columbia County Department of Social Services ex rel. William â€œOâ€ v. Richard â€œOâ€, ###.D.2d 913, 914 (3rd Dep't 1999) (referencing Family Court act Â§ 413(1)(a)). However, a parent is not required to support an emancipated child.  A child is deemed to be emancipated if he/she attains his/her economic independence through employment, entry into armed forces, or marriage. in addition, a minor may be deemed constructively emancipated if, without cause, the minor withdraws from parental supervision and control. (See, e.g., (Matter of Lowe v Lowe, ### 682, 683 (2d Dept 2009). if a person under the age of ###/her parents and has not entered the military or been married, and receives public assistance from a county, the county that provided such assistance can seek to recover back child support payments from the child's parents. (See, Family Ct Act Â§ 415; Social Services Law Â§ 101(1)). To avoid such liability, the parents would have to prove that the child voluntarily left the parental home in order to avoid parental authority (i.e., not because the parent threw the child out or because the home was unsafe) and that the parent asked the child not to leave and offered to allow the child to return.  If the parent can prove those facts, the court will deny the petition for child support because the child was constructively emancipate. A minor does not become emancipated when a court issues an order stating the child is emancipated.  An emancipated child can also become unemancipated if she moves back into her parents' home. Again, there is in any court order that establishes the unempancipation. Rather, it comes to exist when the child returns to her home. Courts that issue decisions concerning whether a minor is emancipated are almost always issued after the fact and simply acknowledge that emancipation exists (or finds that it does not exist).  The decision is not creating the condition of emancipation.   When a parent forces a young person to leave the home or if the child leaves because the home is unsafe, the parent remains responsible for the child's support. In such a case, the child can pursue a claim for child support from the parent. The cases I have handled always concerned a claim by a county that has paid public assistance benefits to a minor while the parent was allegedly responsible for the child's support, and the county is seeking to recover the child support. However, in the Columbia County case cited above, the Appellate Court states that the county in that case only had as much of a right to recover child support from the parent as the child did. This clearly indicates that the child has a right to recover child support payments if he/she is not emancipated.    Relative to your eligibility for financial aid, I am sure that the income and assets of your parent(s) must be taken into account if you are the dependent of your parent(s). However, based on the facts that you have described, I believe that you have been emancipated for some time. Your emancipation has existed regardless of whether a court issued an order acknowledging the fact.Therefore, I do not believe that there is any statute or regulation that requires you to provide a court order declaring your emancipation as a condition to being considered an emancipated minor for purposes of financial aid. You should be able to establish the relevant facts by submitting an affidavit that details them and which has the relevant documents attached (e.g., lease agreement, pay stubs, utility bills, etc.). (An affidavit is a document that begins with the declaration that I Evelyn Oberly hereby state that the following is true under penalty of perjury." This declaration is followed by a series of sequentially numbered paragraphs that lay out the relevant facts. You can attach relevant documents that support your representations as exhibits. You would sign it before a notary public.)If someone at the college financial aid office tells you that you must have a court order declaring you to be emancipated ask that person to provide you with the statute or regulation that requires an order. I doubt that there is one. I cannot guarantee that but I am fairly confident of it. I think that a sworn affidavit should meet their requirements.If there is a requirement that you have a court order you can obtain one without getting into an adversarial posture with your mother. She would benefit from such a court order and she could file an affidavit supporting it or - at least - not oppose an application for such an order. Of course this assumes that you were not forced to leave her home because she threw you out or it wasn't safe. If that assumption is wrong then your mother is technically still responsible for your support. In that case you could seek child support if you really wanted to do so and this might provide enough leverage for you to get some help with the cost of college. Please let me know if you have any questions. Jim Evans"44251.8034722222 HIIâ€™m ### 30-###. Iâ€™m graduating high school this year and when applying for fafsa/TAP, Iâ€™m being told i cannot file as independent unless Iâ€™m ###. Iâ€™m also told in new york i cannot apply for emancipation directly and the judgeâ€™s decision to emancipate you has to be tied to another case. I left my familyâ€™s house in November of ###, but i never started any legal case against her in court about the abuse because i wanted to keep things simple and just leave and make it on my own, also i knew that child protective services might split up my little brothers and put them in foster care since i was unable to legally or financially take care of them myself if my mother went to jail.My mother was only abusing me. My mother and i are not on speaking terms and i think i qualify to be considered independent but now need a legal proceeding in court. I also found out that in New York  that at ###â€™re no longer a minor but youâ€™re not considered independent until youâ€™re ###. So my first questions is can i sue my mother for child support and during that proceeding in court, go against my own suit by proving i donâ€™t need child support and ask for emancipation? If this idea is terrible then my second question is what other cases can i bring to court or other ways other than joining the military or getting married to achieve the goal of emancipation.

A child ma###also constructivel###emancipated himself or herself if he/she is old enough to work and voluntaril###leaves the home of his/her parent(s), over the objection of the parent(s).

Cases indicate that a constructive emancipation requires evidence that the parent was not the cause of the child leaving the home (i.e., did not throw the child out of the home) and that the rules the child sought to avoid compl###ng with were objectivel###reasonable.

She can't buy or lease a car or a lease  house or apartment or purchase things since a minor can disaffirm any purchase that they make so they won't let her buy anything of value. She maybe doesn't know this or never knew this.You as a stepmother unless you adopted her or have some guardianship or conservatorship over her are not legally responsible for her. As far  medication it is tough to have them make these decisions about taking medication.  If she has depression attacks and so forth and doesn't take her medicine she will be custody of the police or otherwise.

Was the boys mother and father married? If not is there any kind of court proceedings or order giving the grand mother custody of your stepson. Does she have guardianship of your stepson. There are  four issues involved in your situation. One is emancipation. The other is custody of the child if he is under the age of ###, and the third issue is the SSI change of pay representative from the grandmother to either you or ### Fast Horse.  The last one is if he needs someone appointed for medical issues whether either by accident or otherwise in school or otherwise.the issue of Emancipation is one that is given by the courts to children under the age of ###. If the child is ### ###. There is no requirement that the child be emancipated under the age of ###. Whether the circumstances in your situation would  warrant the courts to give an emancipation is really dependent on each individual fact situation and it is hard to come up with some  general rule. If the father and the mother were married, there maybe an divorce. if they were not married and had the child, then you would still have to file a form UJS ###. How to fill out that form and file it listed below.The third issue is one of SSI, those regulations change almost yearly, so you would have to check with the Social Security and see what you need to do to change they use to call it payroll representative or pay representative of the SSI account from the grandmother to either ### or  to you. The question is what is going to be required by social security to change the pay representative from the grandmother to either ### or to you. It is my suggestion you should work on this question first. If social security needs for you or ### to need an order for custody of the son you can do that. If they will allow you to be the pay representative if your just a guardian you maybe should do that.The guardianship is a lot easier if you don't have too long until your stepson turns  ###. The custody of the child with the grandmother giving up the SSI may be a lot more drawn out, since she is losing the income for the child. The schools if he is attending are probably going to require someone sign for the son, concerning his medical issues and also what he needs parental signatures at schoolHere is the information for filing the UJS ###.The issue is custody of the child. If the parties were not married and had a child in State Court you would still have to file that form and have a hearing. This would be a UJS ###. We do not have a form or forms that is entitled Petition for custody of the minor child where the parents had a child but were not married.. Since you will have to set forth the facts for the court so they have information concerning you which you would be the plaintiff and the  grandmother  would be the defendant and information of the child, the full name, date of birth. Where she has been living the last ###. You can check form UJS ###  for the court. This information will need to be write in the Affidavit of the ###.In writing the Affidavit you must set forth the fact the Plaintiff is the father and mother had a child and  the defendant is the grandmother who had custody of his son and insert your name as  the Plaintiff and your full legal name  and date of birth is  name  and address are mother of a child and the grandmother  is the Defendant and his full legal name is and his date of birth is and insert his and address . You would have to set forth the name of the child and the date of birth. Insert the address of where the son has been living for the last five years  name of person living with county and dates. Other than the parties, no one has ever had legal custody of the child except the the plaintiff father and the defendant grandmother.  That there has been no court proceedings of any kind  concerning the custody of the child made by the court. That because set forth all of those circumstances or facts you believe you are the proper person to have legal and physical custody of the minor child. as follows set forth all of the circumstances: You will have to write on the affidavit attached are  the circumstances you believe you are the proper person to have  legal and physical custody of the child.The motion is that you wish to have sole legal and physical custody of the minor child. The Clerk will set a hearing on your motion.

The short answer to your question regarding whether you can sue the ### is probably not. There is a legal principle called ### superior which states that employers can be responsible for the actions of their employees in certain situations.  A court will consider at least the following factors in determining whether an employer is responsible:Was the act carried out while the employee was on the clock?Was the act carried out as part the employeeâ€™s job duties or responsibilities?Was the act of the same nature as the employeeâ€™s job responsibilities?Was the employee motivated to commit the act for the purpose of benefiting the employer?Assuming the ### employee beat your nephew while on the clock, we can say the answer to the first factor above is yes." But the beating was not done as part of the employee's job duties/responsibilities and it was not of the same nature as the employee's job responsibilities. (An example of an incident that would require answering "yes" to the second and third factors might be a truck driver getting into an accident while on its route.)Finally it is very doubtful that the ### employee was motivated to beat your nephew to benefit the ###; if anything the incident would have the opposite effect.In summary it would not be impossible to be able to collect damages from the ### but it is not likely since the employee was clearly acting outside of his or her scope of employment.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.Best regardsVolunteer Attorney"43844.8583333333 My nephew was beaten in a ### by an employee and I have a police report, can I sue la ###?43840.9701388889 Greetings ###,I am sorry to hear about your situation.

Regardless of whether the charge is related to another juvenile case, your son is being booked as an adult now.  Juvenile records are still sealed but the booking itself is treated as a separate record. There is nothing illegal about public record of an individual being booked or incarcerated.

We are not investigators.  We are not law enforcement officers. I understand that you feel an injustice occurred but I regret that this is not a matter that we can address on this website.43895.1875 At the age of three I was diagnosed with a learning disability. Since then I've been in the slower classes at school and I'm ###. I left home once already to stay with an older man who I love dearly and was a friend of mine and my mother trick me to come back home by saying that me and him to still be friends and see each other and she will not stop us. Now that I'm home she is insisting that I cannot leave again and that she will not let me. I could go stay with my friend again if they would let me and legally I know I'm allowed to but my brother is threatening to kill the guy and it's all kinds of crazy stuff going all but I don't want to leave my house anymore and I'm ready to go. What legal document can I serve my mother with that would be official and her releasing Me and not being able legally to come after me and if she does it would be something that would get her in trouble?43893.08125 I couldn't say whether that is normal in this situation.  However, I believe it is pretty common knowledge that you are considered an adult once you reach the age of ###, with all of the rights and responsibilities that come with being an adult, unless there is some legal reason why someone else can continue to act of your guardian.  Based on what you've said, it does not appear as though there is any legal reason you cannot exercise all of your rights as an adult, including making the decision for yourself regarding where and with whom you will live.  There may be lawyers out there that are willing to draft some letter saying that you are an adult under the law, but I'm not sure that is necessary.  Again, as long as no one is appointed your guardian or has some other special legal right to make you live with them, no one should be able to call the police and have them pick you up and make you come home.However (and this is important), you need to comply with the recent Stay Safe at Home Order issued by ### County in the wake of the COVID-###.  This includes not leaving your residence unless it is for an essential activity, to provide essential government work, or to operate an essential business.  If you are not in any material danger where you currently live, I would recommend that you continue to live at this residence until the Stay Safe at Home Order is lifted, for your personal safety and for the safety of others that you may come into contact with.Thank you. 43920.8152777778 If I understand you correctly, you are over the age of ###, there has been no guardianship proceeding since you turned ###, and you believe the only power of attorney is in regard to control of your SSI benefits.  Do you happen to have a copy of the power of attorney?  Or do you know if or where the power of attorney has been filed (for example, with a court)?Thank you.43915.8416666667 Just to summarize, no one has been appointed the guardian of your person or estate, there is only one power of attorney that has been executed, which was filed with the Social Security Administration in order for your parent to be appointed your representative for the purposes of receiving you SSI payment.  Based on that information:###) There is no document that needs to be submitted to your parents in order to emancipate yourself.  You are an adult without an incapacity (based on what you've told me) and should therefore be legally in charge of your own person. IF you leave the house, for example, your parents should not be able to call the sheriff's office to have officers escort you back to your parents' house.  ###) If you wish to revoke the POA on file with the Social Security Administration so you can direct payment of any SSI payments yourself, you will need to file a written declaration revoking the previous POA.  You should contact your local Social Security office so they can walk you through that process.  The office may even have a form you can fill out and file.  I know there may be a bit of a wait at the moment in order to speak with someone there, but the office should be in the best position to assist you with terminating the POA.###) Please be cautious if you seriously feel members of your family might engage in violence towards yourself or anyone else.  If you honestly feel that you or someone else is in danger, please immediately seek help from your local law enforcement authorities.Thank you, and good luck.43916.6666666667 Ms. ###:In your summary, you mentioned that you are ###, but you are being told that you cannot leave your parents' home.  You also mentioned that you were diagnosed at age ###.Do you know if one or more of your parents has been appointed as your guardian?  This process would likely have taken place shortly before or sometime after your 18th birthday.  You also would probably have been interviewed by someone from the court, perhaps identifying themselves as an ad litem" or an "attorney ad litem."  That piece of information would be useful in providing you any advice we might have regarding your situation.Thank you. "43913.8965277778 Never been to court and no ###. As far as i know the only thing she has is power of attorney over receiving a social security check that I get that I don't know how much it is or how to obtain it by myself unless I go to the Social Security administration myself. As far as I know the only thing that has happened as she's just been my legal guardian because she's my mother and has taken care of me all these years. When I first went to live with my older friend she called the cops on him and when it was all said and done the cops were first going to come make me leave and then after they read some kind of paperwork the cop said they could do nothing about it. So I don't believe there's anything in the form of a court order stopping me from leaving home but I need to serve her with some kind of paperwork providing her with information letting her know that I do not want bothered by her or any more tricks and holding me hostage in the house where I'm staying. So if you could come up with some kind of verbiage or a legal statement that I can provide her with so when I leave this time she can't bother me anymore please let me know. Your help in this matter is greatly appreciated thank you43914.7798611111 Never seen it.

Would your cousin's parents consent to you obtaining custody?In order for your cousin to be successful in her emancipation hearing, there are several statutory criteria for emancipation, please see below.

Itâ€™s getting to much he wonâ€™t leave and police will not take him out because of COVID and now he lives here even thought he is not on the lease what can I do to get him out because they arenâ€™t doing evictions and I canâ€™t wait ###. 44075.5222222222 As you may be aware, there's a federal law that prohibits persons convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence from owning or using firearms. However, state law and federal law approach domestic violence differently. Under ### Code Sec. ### the misdemeanor applies to assault against a family or household member, such as a parent. However, the federal law is narrower and doesn't specifically include the assault of a parent by a child. As such, this charge likely would not remove your gun rights. I recommend talking with your probation officer or your attorney (if you were represented for this misdemeanor) for more details. Also, this would likely come up during the process of purchasing a firearm. 44154.0520833333 Both state and federal law apply â€” with gun rights, both the states and the Federal Government have control, which can definitely lead to confusion! When it comes to misdemeanor domestic violence convictions and gun rights in ###, the federal law applies. However, the federal ban defines domestic violence differently than the ### law you were convicted under. Under the federal ban definition, the assault has to be done by a parent, guardian, or spouse. Thatâ€™s the definition that applies to the ban, rather than the ### definition. So while you were convicted of domestic violence, it wasnâ€™t the type of violence that would trigger the ban. All that being said, I would check with your probation officer or a criminal attorney: if youâ€™re still on probation or if your father has a protective order, you may have other restrictions on your gun rights. But the conviction itself likely wonâ€™t result in you losing your rights.  Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™ve been able to help! 44154.0736111111 Funny part is ended up pleading guilty to it so I could get released from probation to enlist which has failed .44153.8333333333 Hi ###,I've looked into your question regarding being able to enlist in the armed forces with a domestic violence conviction on your juvenile record. My understanding is that the Army, the ###, and the Coast Guard state that a felony conviction (either as an adult or a juvenile) for domestic violence will prevent you from being able to enlist. The Air Force, however, considers criminal records on a case-by-case basis. I could not find a conclusive answer as to the Marine Corps, though they do perform a background check.It's not clear from your question whether your conviction was a felony or a misdemeanor. If the conviction was a felony, then your best chance would be to talk to an Air Force ### or a Marine Corps ###, as they are the branches that are open to considering felony convictions on a case-by-case basis. However, it might be a long shot.If it was a misdemeanor, though, my recommendation would be to talk to a recruiting officer in the branch of the military that you are interested in joining. Be completely open and honest about what occurred, and be prepared with any documents that you have relating to the conviction. It also may help to bring a list of people who could be character references (like teachers, coaches, bosses, family, etc.) -- I haven't gone through the ### process myself, but I've gone through background checks and this is often something that is asked for. The military wants to be sure that all personnel are of good moral character, so being honest and prepared will help demonstrate that the misdemeanor conviction is just one part of your past. 44153.9423611111 It was a misdemeanor. But I do have more stuff , a trespass that was amended from a burglary , and ###44153.9513888889 Okay , I have one more question, with all this being said does my domestic violence charge tAke away my gun rights?44154.0229166667 Okay, I will never understand how the motto of juvenile courts is to rehabilitate, but have such a damaging affect on young peopleâ€™s future, Iâ€™m only ###â€™s really disheartening. I thank you so very much for your time and help , you have been very patient if I could tip you or rate you ### . 44154.08125 Okay, so thatâ€™s confusing. Does federal law trump state law ? I just want to say thank you, you have been so so so helpful Iâ€™ve had these questions for so long and youâ€™ve answered them exactly how I needed, thank you so much. 44154.0604166667 That history may prove challenging. However, I recommend talking to a ### to find out their perspective. Itâ€™s likely that theyâ€™ve encountered similar situations before. Again, make sure that you lay everything out clearly and make sure you are totally honest. 44154.0215277778 Would I still be able to join the armed forces with a domestic violence conviction on my juvenile record?I defending myself from my dad and he filed charges against me saying I assaulted him.44153.8319444444 He wonâ€™t turn ###. 43965.0611111111 Hi ###,I have done some research on the topic and I note the following:In Texas a ###/legal guardians by law enforcement because a ###, although a minor, is not considered a child under the Juvenile Justice Code. Therefore the police is not required to make your friend leave if they find him at your home and determine that he is safe. My understanding is that most police departments in Texas will not force a ###.In addition, if his parents have reported your friend missing but they know that he is staying with you, your friend would not be considered missing because his parents know where he is to be found and therefore law enforcement would not be required to take him back to his parents.  Has your friend been reported as a missing person and do his parents know that he is staying with you?There are potentially criminal consequences of harboring a minor runaway but my understanding is that given your friend is ###, it is very unlikely that you would face any consequences for harboring him although this cannot be excluded as law enforcement could decide to bring criminal charges against you if you get caught.Your friend can legally leave his parentsâ€™ house without their consent before he is ###. To be emancipated from his parents, your friend must be living away from his parents and be self-supporting and managing his own financial affairs. Does your friend have a job or any money to support himself?  To become emancipated, your friend would need to petition the court. Given that he will be ### ###.You have not told me why your friend no longer wishes to live with his parents. This would be relevant in any emancipation proceedings.I enclose some information for you on emancipation and how it works:https://texaslawhelp.org/article/emancipation-minors#toc-2I would advise you to contact the Texas Youth Runaway Hotline on 1-800-### to obtain more advice, it is free and confidential.Please let me know if you have any other questions, I hope the advice I gave you was helpful.I wish you and your friend all the best and hope that he manages to live without his parents until he is ###.###43972.5506944444 Hi ###,Many thanks for your question, I will look into this for you and provide some advice in the next few days.All the best###43965.7006944444 How can he legally leave his parents house without their permission before he turns ###?43965.0611111111 My friend is ###. What trouble can the both of us get into if we get caught? Can they make him leave? Will I get in trouble for harboring a runaway?43965.0604166667 Good evening, let me try and answer your question.  Under Texas law a person is an adult for criminal purposes at age 17.  They cannot vote until ###, cannot drink or purchase tobacco until 21.  But at 17, they can be treated as an adult in the criminal justice system.  I am not aware of any prohibition against news organizations or social media sites from using their photograph and even publishing their name and basic identifying information.  If they were below the age of ###, that would not be proper because the case would initially be handled in a juvenile court.  I hope this answer helped and apologize that it took so long to obtain an answer.44019.9597222222 Is it legal for the name and photo of a ### old criminal suspect to be cat on the news and social media sites? Warrants have been issued. Just needing to confirm whether still considered a juvenile or if the criminal aspect of the situation removed that right from the suspect? 43993.0465277778 Ms. ###,There is of course no law against teenagers simply dating, no matter their ages.  However, there can be legal consequences if the dating relationship develops into a physical relationship.  Whether Texas or Ohio law applies depends on whether the physical act happens in Texas or Ohio.  If your son and his friend have consensual sex in Texas, he would not be violating the law.  In Texas, you must be ###.  That means that an older person who has sex (or ### in various types of sexual conduct listed in the Texas Penal Code) with someone under ###, even if the younger person apparently consented (Texas Penal Code ######.0######(a)(###)(A)-(E)).  However, Texas has a so-called â€œ### and ###â€œ law, which is an affirmative defense to prosecution for statutory rape (Texas Penal Code ######.0######(e)(###)-(###)).  There are ###-and-### exception to apply: (###) Both parties must consent; (###) the older person is no more than ###; (###) the younger person is at least ###; and (###) neither party is a registered sex offender (or required to register as a sex offender).  From the facts you given meâ€”your son is ### ######â€”it sounds like they would be in the clear.In Ohio, it is an offense for an individual ### ###6.  This wouldnâ€™t be a problem now, of course, but if the relationship lasts long enough for your son to turn ### ###5, your son would be violating Ohio law.  Because your son is less than ###, he would be committing a ### misdemeanor potentially punishable by a fine, jail time, or both (Ohio Revised Code Ann. ###907.0###(B)(###)). 44019.8375 Thank you very much for your reply. My son plans to wait until marriage for intercourse but I was worried about them talking and â€˜datingâ€™ long distance because of age.

And live with a man that is 10+ years older than her without her parent's consent. My daughter is a senior this year, and refuses to listen to me because she claims she is an adult. And local law officials claim that they can't get involved?44060.8569444444 Hello ###,I am happy to answer your question, and you should know that there is a legal/technical answer and then a practical answer â€“ and the answers are different.Legally speaking, a minor in Texas (which by definition is a resident who is younger than ###) generally may not move out of his or her parentâ€™s house without parental consent.  The major exception to this is that if the minor has been legally emancipated, the minor may move out without parental consent. Practically speaking, law enforcement almost never gets involved or brings the minor back home.  There have been several General Opinions by the Texas Attorney General addressing this subject (this one is most relevant), and the summary is that if a minor is younger than ###, the minorâ€™s parents may file a missing child report and the police are then required to locate and return the child.

Or are you seeking monetary compensation?First of all, unless you have deep pockets to retain a private lawyer, youâ€™re not going to be able to sue to the government successfully.  These types of lawsuits takes years and years and hundreds of thousands of dollars in expert fees.But, second, is this a real problem that needs to be addressed?  Surprisingly, yes.  At least one class action suit has been brought in Missouri.  Iâ€™d reach out to the people involved in the lawsuit (see article below) and maybe they have suggestions for who you should talk to in Texas.  Otherwise, youâ€™d have to reach out to mass tort law firms (personal injury lawyers who deal with class action lawsuits) and maybe this is a case they want to invest in.This type of lawsuit is beyond the scope of legal aid and pro bono attorneys.  At least you can know that itâ€™s possible - even if itâ€™s a moonshot goal.https://www.courthousenews.com/foster-kids-suing-for-overmedication-win-class-status/44162.5930555556 For a ### I have included the following link:https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/arbitrary#:~:text=%2F%CB%88%C9%91%CB%90rb%C9%AAtreri%2F%20%28of%20an%20action%2C%20a%20decision%2C%20a%20rule%2C,seemed%20completely%20arbitrary.%20He%20makes%20unpredictable%2C%20arbitrary%20decisions.44155.6201388889 Last Saturday I was pulled over and given an DUI citation for a minor, the officer was extremely nice to me because he said I was vary compliant, and that's why he did not charge me with a DWI, even though Im 19.

If not, consider contacting your local legal aid society to see if they are able to assist.  Legal counsel can provide much more specific and comprehensive legal advice.  With that said, I can provide to you some general information regarding HOA assessments.  If your HOA covers more than ###, then it has to establish guidelines for working out payment plans.  I went ahead and downloaded the payment plan policies for your HOA and have attached them here for your reference.  It looks like the default payment plan is ### 10% down payment.  I would get in contact with the HOA right away to discuss.  In those discussions, make sure that it is clear that the lawsuit will be suspended as long as you are complying with the payment plan.    One thing to notice is that, you may not be able to get a payment plan if you've defaulted on a previous payment plan within the last ###.  I noticed that there were a couple of previous liens filed against your property by the HOA for non-payment of assessments.  I attached the most recent one I could find here for your information (###).  So, if you've had a previous payment plan with the HOA and defaulted on that, this could be a problem for setting a new payment plan.  Do your very best to stick with the payment plan because, among other reasons, the law says that your payments under the payment will be applied first to the amounts you owe that could serve as a basis for foreclosing on your house. I hope this helps.  Good Luck. 44319.7243055556 I live ###., Fort Worth, TX 76118I received a citation from the clerk of ### County Court regarding HOA assessment fees totaling about ###. The court wants me to respond within the next ###. My question is: Is it possible to just do a payment plan and get it out of the court? If so, how do I respond and who do I contact to proceed? Thank you!44317.1965277778 Hello , I want to thank you for your time. So my question pertains to my ### , i have joint conservatorship with the other parent and im needing to know if there is any legal action the father can take or use against me if i choose to allow my son to live with me without his permission or being in agreement to let him. 44317.825 Hi,Thanks for posting. Depending on the terms of the order and whether you are able to make this decision unilaterally, the other parent may have to agree to this.Modification of SAPCR/custody (uncontested cases): ###https://texaslawhelp.org/article/child-custody-conservatorship44321.6819444444 Before living with my abusive father i had lived with my mom who lost custody due to neglect and drugs. I had been abused ###.  i have been jumping from houses of people i have met. Now that im ###. how do i prevent any legal issues so that i can work and start school? 44326.9347222222 Also, don't take any sexual or nude pictures or video of a minor meaning anyone under ###  She should not take any either. Its strange but even though she can consent to sex that doesn't mean that she can't be prosecuted for sending child pornography if she sends you any body part pictures. 43416.8798611111 Assuming your girlfriend lives in Iowa and you are less than four years older, I don't think you would be violating the ### Statutory Rape Law. The age of consent is 16, but ### ###. It is important to be careful that you are both sober, not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol, and not feeling too much pressure. Her family could get very protective of her and look to see if there is anyway that they can prosecute you for sexual assault - I assume you aren't her coach or tutor or anything. One family prosecuted the boyfriend based on their having sex in another state where the laws were different. I remember how naive I was at that age and she might be sending mixed signals without realizing it so it is good to have a serious talk about what she is comfortable with. Looking back, I was lucky that most of the men I interacted with were good people who didn't pressure me to do things I wasn't ready for - going into a hotel room or back of the car does not mean yes she wants to have sex. Also be aware of body language ### that she is hurting or feeling scared. Sometimes people freeze up when they get scared. Also I think it will help you if you are very responsible about using protection so that she doesn't get pregnant or any diseases. Your school counselor might know a source of free condoms or you can buy condoms at most stores. Girls can get pregnant before they start ### regularly and tend to be somewhat irregular as they start so don't rely on timing  or pulling out unless you both want to have a child. I would highly recommend she talk to her doctor about hormonal birth control like pills or implants  in addition to using condoms. Using just condoms or just the pill I think around ### ###. If she doesn't feel comfortable talking to her doctor about birth control, that might be a sign that she isn't ready to have sex yet. Other frequently asked questions: she is allowed to change her mind, it doesn't matter what she is wearing, it doesn't matter what she did in the past.  But the good news is that getting affirmative consent is sexy - ask her if she likes it when you talk dirty to her. Or ask her if she likes what you are doing.Have fun, be careful, safety first! 43416.8743055556 I am ### ###. Would it be acceptable if both engage in sexual activity?

For the most part, you can say whatever horrible things you want to a person or suggest they do whatever, and it's simply freedom of speech. If it continues or if they do it in an ### threatening manner wherein you feel they are themselves threatening to harm you, then perhaps you could obtain a civil protection order against them and/or report them to the police for charges. But if it was just the one occasion and just words, nothing will likely be able to come of it. 44384.8847222222 Hi, I help out at an auto body shop here and there sometimes as a ### and I was there today helping out a case in which the police had to be called in order to decide whether or not release a car to a client that had not paid.

In the case there was false information and omitted information. It made me sounds horrible. There was substance abuse marijuana I was accused of havding dangerous substances. The original allegations were that I was doing meth. I agreed to a hair stat and the worker said if it came back for marijuana then my case would probably go to being closed. I have this written down. It came back dirty for marijuana. And the case goes on and Iâ€™m put on the registry with my children chinad because I am unsafe. Previous to this I had criminal charges and had attended in patient substance abuse treatment for alcohol. I am in therapy still for PTSD for phychologkcal abuse from the ex husband.

It's not a do it yourself project. You can look on www.texaslawhelp.org and see if they have any info on that topic.In Texas it's called in the TX Family Code - Removal of Disabilities - and you can read the code on-line for free. You will see that the teen-agers must fulfill all the requirements in order to be called an adult in Texas. When I practiced many years ago I quoted each teen-ager that called me $5,###. None could afford it. The filing fee alone is $### (another $150) and then there is an attorney appointed to represent the child's interests and she would pay for that too - probably could range from $500-$2,500. And some judges in Texas won't emancipate no matter what - it's 100% up to the judge. So you truly need an attorney in the county where the case was held to tell you what they think the judge would do before you spend a lot of time and money. In the meantime, if she is unhappy then she should make out-cry to her doctors and/or someone in school. Or she could just call CPS herself and ask to be moved. Her well being is a priority. No one wants the child to be depressed or run away from home. Life on the streets is much harder than most teen-agers imagine. Most end up prostituting and/or being sold into the sex trade.

You are entitled to know what the status of your case is. Typically, your attorney should keep you informed. Have you tried to contact your attorney?If you were to contact your attorney, please ask what steps you need to take before the court would consider a change in visitation.  Then, if you wanted to ask the court for permission to change the visitation schedule, your attorney would file a motion. This document would have to explain why you think that unsupervised visits or even more frequent supervised visits would be good for your children.My advice to you would be to contact your attorney and caseworker and get more information:###.) Call your attorney to talk about what you need to do to increase visitation; if you have done enough, ask your lawyer about filing a motion to ask permission for increased visitation.  You do not have to wait all the way until TERM000###88 to ask the court for such permission.###.) Take some time to think about all you have done according to the plan. Write down what you have done and, possibly, what you still need to do.###.) Talk to your caseworker about what you might still have to do for increased visitation.

I found an attorney in Chillicothe, Il that I am going to contact Monday as he is supposed to be very reasonable and recommended by a couple people I know. Also, my caseworker just texted me asking if I could text her the days we had visits with the kids in January, but the visits are supposed to be reported by the foster parent. 44232.9715277778 Thanks for getting back to me. I tried to look up your case to see if I could get more information but, most likely because of privacy laws in cases dealing with a minor, I canâ€™t see the record.I know this is frustrating but youâ€™ll need to call the clerk one more time to find out whether you can participate via internet/Zoom. Also ask whether the computer record shows if there was ever an attorney appointed for you.If an attorney was appointed, then you need to call that person. If no appointment was made, then I will send you a list of organizations for you to call so you can hopefully have someone represent you at the next hearing date, especially if you are told that you are not allowed to participate virtually.44222.8548611111 That was good that you followed up!  Did they promise to send you a link for Zoom participation?You now have a couple of options: You can file a MOTION with the court. A motion is basically a document that you write to tell the judge about the facts of the case and that you would like to have unsupervised visits or, least find out what you have to do to get unsupervised visits.  Do you paperwork that states what the current plan is or paperwork that says what your have completed?I can help you with writing this motion. You would have to be absolutely sure that you mail a copy of it to your social worker and the DCFS representative, and whoever else is on the case. Sometimes, there is a States' Attorney involved.  Sometimes, there is a GAL involved.  You have look at any paperwork you have to see who is involved.The other option is to start looking for a lawyer that will actually represent your interests in court. If you have resources to pay a lawyer, I can give you names of lawyers in your area who work at law firms.  If you have limited resources to afford an attorney, I can give you names of organizations that will help with finding representation for low cost or no cost, depending on your income.When is the last time you saw your children?

I also need help fighting a new allegation against my girlfriends child which was false.44208.8159722222 Mr. ###,You will need to provide more information about your previous case and the new allegation to get assistance with this question. I am taking it that you have/had a child in the child protection court (juvenile court) and the judge found you unfit to parent the child.

It sounded like you have been in court - are these new allegations and you have an ongoing case? Best###"44245.6861111111 Ms. ###, I think it is important to bring up the lack of a service plan at the earliest time that you are able. I am sorry that you are going through this but at this point the best thing to do is to ask to speak to the judge and let her/him know that you do not have a service plan. Best,###44242.9631944444 Ms. ###,I am sorry to hear that your children were removed. To answer your question, I am going to need a little more information. Do you have a DCFS or caseworker from another agency assigned to you? If no, I would reach out to the court to get the ball rolling on getting a caseworker as they create a service plan. If yes, then the caseworker should provide you a copy of the service plan and communicate with you what you need to do to complete the service plan. Did you have something called a permanency hearing" - in general those hearings are were a "goal" is set. Those goals can be "return home in ### return home in ### etc.? If yes, then I would follow all of the services to the letter and cooperate with the caseworker. That -may- speed up the process of having your children returned home under a safety plan. Also, where were your children placed? There are different placements - such as relative foster care where they are placed with one of your relatives, or just foster care where they are temporarily placed with a foster care giver. Make sure to follow the caseworker's instructions about visitation and see your children as often as is allowed. These are all favorable things for a judge to see when determining goals and whether or not to return your children.All the best,###44238.7416666667 Ms. ###,I am sorry. That does sound incredibly frustrating. I would bring up the lack of a service plan at your adjudicatory hearing. Best,###44239.7652777778 Ms. ###,I would urge your current attorney to get you a copy of the service plan. If you do not have one - that is an issue to raise with the judge. You must have had permanency hearings since your case came into child protection. A permanency hearing is a hearing where the court sets a goal such as return home in ### return home in ### etc. Do you remember what goal was set for your case?While there may be local differences, I believe that the Office of the Cook County Public Guardian provides a good definition of each stage of the child protection proceedings (link here: https://www.publicguardian.org/juvenile/about/child-protection/). In general, at an adjudicatory hearing, all parties will present evidence (e.g., photos, written documents, etc.) and may call people to testify (DCFS investigator, DCFS caseworker, etc.) to either prove or disprove that there was neglect, abuse, and/or dependency. Your attorney will have the opportunity to cross-examine (question the person) after they are called by the other parties (like the State's attorney). Your attorney can also call witnesses (e.g., people who can talk about how they have never seen abuse, neglect, and/or dependency issues in your household) and then the State's Attorney and other parties can ask that witness questions (Cross-examination). I know that the legal jargon can get confusing so please let me know if you need any clarification. All the best,###44239.5826388889 Ms. ###,Was your husband and/or his attorney present in court? Best,###44245.7527777778 My husband also tested positive for substances yet the dcfs investigator did not mention it in the first hearing we had nor did anyone including the judge didnâ€™t mention or speak to him. If we decide to split up while I ### my service can he get the kids back. If we prove he was with the kids while I was at the hospital since that accusation was false.44243.9638888889 Neither my caseworker or lawyer have yet to tell me anything on my service plan or a safety plan to get my kids home. And no goals or plan was given by judge. We had our first video chat and one of my daughters (### old) saw me and cried the entire video call uncontrollably. And that broke me and my caseworker was on the call and I donâ€™t want her to be emotionally hurt since she is super super attached to us.

No children were harmed during any of the argument. After taking them to the hospital the DCFS caseworker told me my kids were in good health and when I asked him why he took them he said because I needed a break. Upon taking them my husband and I were not even in the same state and none of his belongings were at our home. We were ordered visitation twice per week for up to four hours but as long as we were not together. We still havenâ€™t gotten any more visitation. I completed my domestic violence course they recommended I also I am into therapy groups. My husband and I are working together to regain custody. Also right before they were taken from us is when Covid hit and domestic violence double back to hundred percent. Not only that but we lost Who we considered a child to us.

I need help fighting to win them back.44237.1409722222 Is DCFS legally able to take your kids away from you just based on the past of you being in a domestic violence case that got your kids taken away completed services and got them back. I had some bruises on my and my neighbors called the police to report that. When the police got to my home my kids were playing and police just pointed the finger at my boyfriend and made him the suspect as to why i had bruises. I told the police where i had gotten my bruises that my boyfriend was not the cause of them. But they didnt believe me and called dcfs and made them come take the kids away from us. There was NO investigation on the allegation and no proof of evidence that my boyfriend caused the bruises. Just because we had a past of ###that we corrected to get our kids back is the only evidence the judge looked at to determine that we needed our kids to be ### of the court and not in our care. The judge himself said he was basing his decision on the past because they dont have evidence that my boyfriend was the one to cause the bruises. There were no arrests either.44242.7284722222 Ms. ###,Have you been assigned a public defender? If so, you may want to discuss with her/him that there was no investigation by DCFS as that would be a breach of their protocol. In general, DCFS has to indicate" (in other words find it probable that abuse/neglect occurred) to send the report to the State's attorney who then decides whether or not there is enough evidence to bring it to court. If the case is not indicated then there should be no court case. It sounds like you are already in front of a judge - do you still have custody of your children (an "intact" case)? Or have they been given to a relative ("relative foster care")? At this stage it may be too late but there is the chance you could appeal DCFS's decision to indicate - more information here: https://www2.illinois.gov/dcfs/aboutus/had/Pages/default.aspx.

Instead of asking for continuance, they went on with the hearing. The ###. I'm looking for a solution that will get this poor boy out. He needs help44358.3895833333 Hello, thank you for submitting your question and I'm sorry to hear about your difficulties with your DCFS case. I suppose the first place to start is with your attorney. If your case is court involved, you have the right to have an attorney appointed to represent you. Has your old attorney already left their old position? Was your old attorney a public defender, a private attorney that was appointed by the court, or a private attorney that you hired and paid for? When is your next court date? This is probably the most important piece because only your attorney will have all the information about your case, etc. and they'll be in a better position to give you advice. If your next court date is soon, then probably the Judge plans to appoint you a new attorney on that date and will probably give that attorney time to meet with you and get caught up on your case before any other hearings occur. To answer a few of your other questions in the meantime:Generally character witnesses would not be helpful or relevant at a regular permanency review hearing (or status hearing). However, if the State does file a petition seeking termination of your parental rights, character witnesses would be helpful. That trial is usually divided into two parts. The first part handles only the issue of whether you are unfit in the ways they allege under the Adoption Act. Because this will only be about whether or not you did or didn't do certain things, character references won't be helpful here. The second part is called a Best Interests hearing. The best interests hearing is about whether termination of rights is in the child's best interests. That second part would be where character witnesses would generally come into play. Hopefully, however, your case won't get to that point. With any luck, your new attorney will be able to explain your situation to the State's attorney and request that they hold off filing termination so that you can show that the relapse was just a bump in the road. The next issue you bring up is what to do about your caseworker. The short answer is probably not a lot. You could maybe file a complaint, but lots of people don't like their caseworkers and it is unlikely they will be fired or taken off your case, in which case, all you have accomplished is making your worker dislike you more. Lawsuits are even less likely and without more information about specific infractions, I don't know how far that will get you and more importantly right now, it's not going to help you get your child back. if you can prove that she lied to the court or in a court report about something related to the case, you'll want to provide that evidence to your attorney immediately. However, if the lies can be written off as mistakes or aren't hugely relevant to your case, it doesn't make sense to litigate those. For example, if the Judge is most concerned about your positive drug tests, complaining about the caseworker and a mixup with appointment or visit dates ###'t lessen their concern over your drug tests. In fact, it could ### because it will look like you're not taking accountability. Basically, if the focus is that you have to have a significant length of sobriety before child can come home, the Judge won't be impressed if you go into court saying things like, but what about the caseworker." Even if she truly is ### the court will always give the caseworker the benefit of the doubt. It would be better for advancing your case to focus on you and what you're doing right rather than pointing fingers. Now again if something has gone on that has seriously hindered your ability to have access to services on her end your attorney will know the right way to point that out in court. Keep records of everything you do and every call you make (including to the caseworker). That will help your new attorney.  Those places with waitlists? Call once a week and keep track of your calls and who you speak to. If you're getting your mental health back on track keep records of your appointments proof of filled prescriptions maybe even ask for short ### of your progress to provide to the court etc. With Substance Abuse programs I don't know how often they drop you but usually you can pay for more drops. So for example if they're only testing you ### per week maybe do ###. They won't be random of course but it's an extra step you can take to have more clean drops on your sheet. I hope I've addressed most of your concerns. I can give you information on next steps towards how to alert the court that you  need a new attorney appointed if you're still not sure who your attorney ### be if you want to respond to my questions at the top. Otherwise good luck to you. I have represented a lot of people in these cases and they have been some of my favorite success stories. I can tell you are hardworking so even though you're facing a lot of struggles right now I know that you can do this!"44305.8944444444 My dcfs case has been shady from day ###, when they took my newborn and wouldn't let me see her for ###.

The original reason they got removed from their home was that a ###.44291.775 ###, Thank you for your question and I'm glad to hear things seem to be getting back on track for you. To answer your first question on what to expect at the first hearing, I think it's unlikely the Judge will hold a full hearing on that date. It's probably more likely that he will make sure all parties were properly sent notice of the court date and set a separate hearing  on the issue of fitness (maybe/hopefully also reappoint your attorney if you had an appointed attorney during the original case). However, if you're reopening a DCFS case, it is possible the Judge will be ready to hear your evidence. You should probably go prepared with evidence and witnesses you may like to present (including proof of the things you've listed above in whatever form you can manage, even if it's just print outs of bills or appointment cards are better than nothing and will back up your testimony). That way at least you are prepared, even if you don't have the whole hearing that day, you can provide any new information about your efforts to correct the conditions that led to your previous unfitness to caseworkers or even the State's Attorney. I don't know the Assistant State's Attorney on these cases in your county, but if they are reasonable, they may agree, which would make your hearing easier and uncontested. If you have more time to prep the hearing, I would suggest providing written documentation of the following:any clean drug screens since you've been outany good write ups or ### from your parole programsIf a summary of your participation isn't available, simple proof of completion is better than nothing (even if it's just an email from your parole officer confirming you've fulfilled your requirements).proof of your inpatient completionthe most recent report from your Domestic class that you can get. Usually if you ask your providers for a short summary on your progress, they will help you out.if you have an online patient portal for your doctor, or if you can just call their office and ask, a print out of your appointments attended. *Bonus if you have a counselor or mentor that has seen you make progress and remain sober and stable that can either testify on your behalf or write you a letter of support. I would also start going to AA/NA if you aren't already and provide sign in sheets for proof of attendance. *A sponsor is a good person for the last bullet point.proof of employment if applicable (I realize you may not be able to work given your pregnancy, but if you are it is also helpful).Proof of housing (even if you're not providing it, proof that you have a stable place for the child to stay during  your parenting time is beneficial and shows stability). if you have roommates or other people in the household, you  need to provide any relevant information on them, even if it's a family member. You want to show the judge that you're an open book.As to your ability to leave the hospital with the baby, that just depends on DCFS and the Assistant State's Attorney in your area. Where I practice, if there the mother and baby didn't test positive for illegal substances at the hospital, then there was no removal (mostly because that would trigger a Temporary Custody/emergency hearing where the State would have to show there was immediate and urgent necessity" to remove the child which they likely wouldn't be able to show without drug exposure at birth). So if you're still clean at the time of birth my experience is that you would be able to leave with your child in your care. However if your county is ultra conservative a Judge could find that a recent case closure with a continued finding of unfitness does equal "immediate and urgent" necessity. Still I would guess that you would be able to take the child home but that DCFS will contact you about intact services or the State may even file a petition on the new child but without taking temporary or emergency custody. Hopefully the State will see that you are doing everything right and expected to be restored to fitness very soon on the older case and not bother. If that's the case DCFS may still follow up with you on a voluntary "intact" case without court involvement. Even though I'm sure you're ready to be done with DCFS and all the extra obstacles having them in your life presents the best advice is to cooperate with what they ask of you. They will see that as a sign that you aren't hiding anything and be more likely to get off your back sooner. Hope this helps. Good luck to you and your family. I know it's daunting and scary but if you stay on the path you are on you will get there! Congrats on the baby and your sobriety.

To fire" a public defender you need to tell the judge that you would no longer like an attorney appointed to represent you. If you already have an upcoming court hearing you can bring it up then. If the next hearing is far away you can ask the court for a special hearing to deal with this issue sooner. Unfortunately the easiest way to do this is to contact your attorney as your attorney will have the most direct contact information for the judge's clerk. If you aren't able to do that you may need to contact the Judge's clerk yourself or write the judge that you need a court date to deal with issues around counsel. If you have another attorney you want to represent you that attorney can contact the Judge's clerk and ask for an "appearance of counsel" date. If for some reason you cannot get anyone's attention prior to the next court date you'll want to address it first thing at the next court date. If the judge grants your request you'll probably then want to ask for a continuance so that you can prepare for whatever that hearing was supposed to be. I cannot guarantee that will be granted. The best way to be prepared for the request for a continuance is to document your attempts to contact your attorney so that you can show the judge that you made an effort to resolve whatever issues you are having and it could not be worked out. The other issue to be prepared for is what you want to do about an attorney after your public defender is out of your case. While it is somewhat dependent on how each county's public defender system is set up most judges will not fire a public defender and then reappoint you a different free lawyer. That means your options will be to represent yourself (which is a very bad idea) or to hire your own attorney. If you want to represent yourself the judge will ask you a series of questions about if you understand your rights and the benefit of having an attorney in your case. If you plan to hire your own attorney you should have that attorney with you at your court date and they will know what paperwork to file to enter their appearance. If you don't want to represent yourself or hire your own attorney it is unlikely the judge will "fire" your public defender. Finally based on  your description and how you categorized this question I'm guessing this is a DCFS case. Unfortunately lawyers play a very small (though important) role in these cases. In most cases once you are at the point of a potential termination the judge has decided that there are issues in the home that need to be addressed before the child(ren) can safely return home. At that point it's a pretty simple issue of either the parents completed their services and resolved these issues or they didn't. Even if you don't get along with your attorney the best thing you can do right now to help your case and avoid termination is to call your caseworker and find out what you need to do and then go do it. If there are barriers preventing you from doing those services or the caseworker is not providing them that is where your attorney can help present that to the court. Your best chances to avoid termination are to contact your caseworker immediately and to contact your public defender immediately rather than waste time trying to switch attorneys. It may be that both are very busy so you may need to make appointments to speak with them. You should document every effort you make to contact either person (even if you just keep a little notebook where you log your call attempts). Good luck to you and your family I hope I was able to help.Sincerely###"44418.6333333333 I am trying to fire my lawyer that I have now she got doing anything for me   so no I can't ask a lawyer I need to fire her44418.4090277778 Thank you very much for responding yeah you've helped out a lot but my thing is is I've had two drops come up dirty but then I've proven them and got proved that they're clean and my attorney won't step up and say nothing I called and called and called and I have visibility the problem is is I have all the documentations but they won't show it to the judge my attorney won't do that and I can't get what needs to be done in front of the judge everything I've done and I've done over and over and over again and my problem is I've had ###'t know what to do I don't know which case worker is mine confusing I basically could represent myself but I don't want to I found a lawyer but it's $3,###'t afford that but like you said the biggest problem is I can't get my attorney to talk to me I can't get her to do the things that she does like the paperwork that we get before court I don't get it until the day of court so I can't even prove the evidence in that Court paper I have all the evidence to show him that I'm right and I'm doing good and everything my kids need to be home she won't even file a ###'t even know that you know when my positive test supposedly comes back that they had to tell me that it was real or that I had one I'm just getting screwed in it and I don't know what to do but I appreciate it thank you very much44419.1923611111 Hi ###,Fortunately, changing your child's name (especially if under ###) is not that hard, and even more so if both parents consent. You will have to go to court, but fortunately, it is almost never difficult or contested.  You can read about how it works here. We also have step-by-step instructions that you can follow and forms you can use to help you generate the paperwork you will need to file here. There is usually a publication requirement for name changes where parents don't agree, but if you fear that that publication in a newspaper would put your child at risk as he transitions, you can ask the judge to waive that requirement. I would certainly ask, because  if running the ad would put your child at risk of physical harm or discrimination, you certainly want to avoid it.If your child's name change is approved by court order, you should get ###'s office, usually for a small fee. You'll need these to change the child's birth certificate and social security card. Then you can submit the necessary paperwork to the Department of Public Health to get a new birth certificate, which will then let you get a new social security card, and then a new driver's ### ID.If your child is over ###, then the steps are slightly different, but generally similar. He will just need to file a different set of forms and follow these instructions. I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any other questions.44431.9020833333 What needs to be done to change my child's name as he transitions?44429.2625 Hi,I'm sorry to hear your family is in this situation--this guy sounds like bad news. However, your options are somewhat limited, especially with respect to your daughter, and especially if she is not ready to be done with him.First, let's talk about you and what you can do to keep him from calling/texting/contacting you.  You may qualify for what is called a stalking no contact order (SNCO). Stalking is when one person (the ###") repeatedly contacts communicates with or follows another person (the "victim"). It must be done in such a way that the victim could reasonably be expected to suffer:Emotional distressFear for their safety orFear for the safety of someone else.In your case because he is making unwanted phone calls or sends unwanted emails or texts (and lots of them by the sound of it) it may qualify as stalking under Illinois law. What you need to do is keep records of all of the times he has contacted you and then use that as evidence in court. We have a form you can use to help you draft the paperwork that is needed so that you don't have to hire a lawyer. You can find it here. Once you have the forms you can use these ### step instructions to get your petition on file. In addition I would recommend that you report all of these calls to the police. There is a chance that the police may also recommend criminal charges for cyberstalking since he is using his phone to harass you. If the police decide to recommend charges then the state's attorney will be able to press those charges and you would not need to hire an attorney. What this means either way is that he would have to stay away from you. And if your daughter is with you then he has to stay away from her too. However it will only work if you are together and it also means that you risk pushing your daughter away and having her meet with him away from you where you can't protect her.Your daughter's case is more difficult. Since she is a minor you could technically bring a case on her behalf against him and since they are in a relationship that would likely be an order of protection. However if she will not cooperate and for example chooses to testify on his behalf the whole thing would be ###. You wouldn't be able to successfully win an order if that is the case.  I would suggest that in addition to counseling you check into having your daughter speak with someone at the local domestic violence organization near you which looks like it may be the Women's Center which serves ### County.I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions."44431.7020833333 My daughter is ###. She is in & out of a toxic,  abusive ### relationship. The boy dropped out of school but recently re-enrolled so now he is around her all day at school. He is ###, will be ### & is only at the high school to be around her. We've asked him to stay away. She blocks him & he harasses her, her friends & me until she will talk to him again. He literally does not stop until she finally gives up & talks to him again. Currently they are together" but have hadn't seen eachother in person in months until he came back to school.  He has gone as far as threatening to kill himself if she doesn't do as he says. Earlier this year she tried to date someone else. On the new boyfriends birthday the toxic ex tried to kill himself & was taken to a facility. Three days later he got out told her it's all her fault & she believed him! She has since acknowledged that he didn't really try to kill himself & it was nothing more than a way to manipulate her. She is in counseling over this but the damage is done. It has destroyed her self esteem & self worth. It's a severely ### relationship. After not seeing him all Summer he reappeared at school & now she is again defending him. It's ### girlfriend or wife defending abusive partner. When I've blocked him from my phone he will even contact me from other numbers to get around it. He doesn't stop. He has brought drugs to my home & left them on my front porch. I need help keeping him away from her & I don't know what to do. I know this is going to end badly if we don't do something. My husband was laid off due to covid & our UI is about to end so we aren't in any position to hire an attorney. I have no idea how to proceed. Thanks. "44429.8284722222 Oh, it's no problem at all! Happy to help. It all depends on what you write on the paper. If you ask the judge to block him from all phones on your plan, it could potentially work. However, if it is widely known that your daughter's number will really only reach her, then the judge might say no. What I would do, if you feel strongly about it, is to ask the judge to block him from contacting you on any of the phone numbers associated with your plan, and see what sticks. Worst case, you get yours, best case, you get all of them or some of them. However, the considerations you note are valid--there are risks in doing this, like alienating or pushing your kid further away, which is definitely not something you want to be doing when she is so vulnerable.Please let me know if you have any other questions.44432.5951388889 Thank you so much for helping me, I appreciate it more than I can tell you. I'm going today to meet with her principle & counselor at her school. They obviously can't discuss another student with me but I felt like it was important that they understand what's been going on & are aware of the situation.  They are also going to explain to me what they can and cannot do if & when we get a no contact order on my daughters behalf. I do have one final question & then I'll be happy to ### this as done so you can move on to others. If I get a no contact order will that apply to all my phones? Her phone is in my name, on my plan. Obviously that runs the risk of this idiot just providing her with a new phone or as you said pushing her further away but I'm curious if it would include her phone since I pay for it & it's on my plan? Thanks again so much for your time. 44432.55 My case will be coming to an end. I am looking for a lawyer to do a lawsuit against dcfs.

Unfortunately, even after termination of parental rights, in some cases the State can continue to go after child support. If you feel that the amount needs to be readjusted or you need some type of payment plan, you might be able to file a motion or contact your child support enforcement office. Sincerely,###44453.9361111111 I know longer have a case they keep taking child support out of us after they terminated are rights 44452.3715277778 ###,I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with this. There are quite a lot of reasons that they can petition to terminate your parental rights. Unfortunately, many of them can be the result of unmet mental health needs. You can see the full list of termination allegations here: https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2098&ChapterID=###. Unfortunately, mental health problems are rarely a defense. Additionally, if you are at the point of termination, you should have an attorney appointed to represent you (unless you waived your right to counsel and opted to hire an attorney or represent yourself). Your attorney is really in the best position to answer questions about your case as they already know what's going on and have all the court filings. You should make an appointment with your attorney to discuss the termination trial, possible defenses, and other options. I hope this helps. Good luck.Sincerely,###44453.9472222222 I was at every visit every court date for the past ###'s life now they want to terminate me because I'm have mental health problems 44452.38125 ###:  This is a much broader question than we can probably answer effectively here. I can tell you, right off the bat, that yes, DCFS can generally get medical records under HIPPA/Section ### (https://www.ilga.gov/commission/jcar/admincode/###0001100R.html), so that's probably no help to you. But, beyond that, you have a lot to deal with here and probably need more direct help than just what you can get from this email service. Have you tried ### State Legal Service in Rock ###? https://www.pslegal.org/offices/. The Family Defense Center also helps people dealing with DCFS issues (and they have a manual that looks pretty good). ###. To your question about filing a federal case: Usually, you have to exhaust your administrative remedies before pursuing any court action (which would usually mean fighting your way through the DCFS process) and you would need a Constitutional issue to get in the door so I don't know how successful that would be, but the folks at ### State might be able to find a way around those issues. Either way, if you can get help from them (or someone they refer you to), that's bound to be a good first step. See also  https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/someone-called-dcfs. Good luck with it all -- you sure are going through a lot, but reaching out for help, like you're doing, is a good way to get moving on these things!

If you think you and your child can work this out, if there's any chance of that, it is probably a good idea to request mediation when you have your court date.You do not have to have a lawyer to fight this.

It is clear that you believe this is outrageous and your son is blameless.  Imagine the school's responisibility to the other children as well as faculty and staff's safety and welfare.  They simply cannot take chances.  You don't HAVE A RIGHT to have your child in school.  You do have an obligation to get him educated however, and you are right, his sitting at home is destructive not to mention dangerous.  he is at a criticalage.  What you must do is follow the guidelines that were presented to you if you intend to get him back in that same school, to a T.  But I fear you aren't taking is seriously and are more angry that in touch with the reality of what your son did.  He has a responsibility here as do you.  He caused all of this and caused fear.

Get on track with what you are supposed to be doing to get your son in line with what the school is asking you to do.43230.8958333333   The simple, legal answer is 'yes'.    But you will have to set forth your reasons in your petition for emacipation and it would have to be served on the other parent (unless their rights had been terminated).   It's not an easy thing and it will vary from judge to judge.   It has to be in the best interests of the minor.   I'm pretty sure you won't find a judge that thinks allowing a minor girl to shack up with her boyfriend is grounds for emancipation.

We need a fast solution. 43976.8673611111 Hi ###:For a petition for emancipation to be granted, the minor has to show that there is â€œgood causeâ€ for the minor to be emancipated. There isnâ€™t a single definition of what good cause is or isnâ€™t so I canâ€™t say with certainty if a judge would see this situation as good cause. What I will say is that I think there is likely a very strong argument to be made if it can be shows that the parentâ€™s actions are negatively impacting the minorâ€™s health and wellbeing. The flip side is that the minor will also need to demonstrate an ability to manage their own affairs, i.e. some sort of plan in place to take care of themselves just like we would expect any other adult. With an attorney knowledgeable in ### courts and advocating for LGBTQ folks, this case could have a positive outcome.Issues around parenting decisions with LGBTQ identified young people can be very tricky to litigate and while no one is required to have an attorney in civil matters it is usually recommended. Please feel free to ask me any follow-up questions you might have about this issue either via this website or otherwise. I wish the best for this young person in difficult circumstances.Best,### J. Hite, The Hite Law Group, LLC43307.1145833333 I completely understand the hesitation to rely on LGBTQ identity as a grounds for emancipation. Using refusal of mental health care ### some of the same struggles: proving via experts that the diagnosis is accurate, the care is essential and required, and that denial would result in certain irreparable harm to the minor. In either case, there would be the need to rely on pretty extensive expert testimony and documentation and I think both arguments can be supported by overwhelming evidence in a general sense and in the case of this particular minor.As far as moving out and requesting signatures, I canâ€™t really give an opinion because that depends so much on the dynamics between the minor and the parents. If the parents are motivated to not completely lose contact with their child, then it might motivate them to use moving out without emancipation as a compromise. However, moving out might be a step too far and the parents donâ€™t want to continue to be responsible for a child that they canâ€™t really control or supervise so they may use the medical releases as a way to hold the minor hostage and make demands from the child. Thatâ€™s something that I canâ€™t decide or really offer recommendations on since itâ€™s a really personal component to this issue.What I can say, as to the emancipation, is that (if that route is chosen) there are many national experts that would likely be willing to lend their expertise for little to no cost in support of this minor attempting to care for themselves without the resistance of their parents. As Iâ€™ve said before, please feel free to contact me with any follow up questions and Iâ€™m more than happy to support in any way that I can.### J. Hite, The Hite Law Group, LLC43308.575 If parents are pressing their religious beliefs upon a minor above the age of ### (as in they donâ€™t allow them to see a therapist for their depression that has been shown to medically exist, or donâ€™t allow them to be part of the lgbtq+ community) is that enough cause for an emancipation. 43305.5652777778 Living in the south I feel the minor may not have as much of a stance when it comes to lgbtq+ issues. So would you agree declining treatment of a medically proven  mental condition would be a stronger case of neglect? Or would it be better in their interests to simply move out and request signatures from the parents when needed? In the latter situation the threat of emancipation would drive them to sign whatever is needed?43308.08125 I have a ###.

Im going to assume that you have not formally adopted your stepson and are therefore neither his biological nor legal parent. If that is inaccurate then some of these options may change.There are ### (### Civil Code Artilce ### et seq.) but the most relevant to your situation are judicial emancipation and limited emancipation by authentic act.Judicial Emancipation requires a minor showing that he can fully (or almost fully) support himself without any assistance or support from anyone else. This means showing adequate ###; housing; personal stability; and decision making capacity. Courts are very hesitant to grant emancipation of minors who don't have a significant track record of self-sufficient independence. Limited Emancipation by Authentic Act is essentially when the parents and child sign a contract that allows the child to make certain limited decisions without input from the parents. I don't know if the parents of this child would agree to let the child make all decisions regarding his own custody but if they are willing to agree to that you could have everyone sign an authentic act that is confirmed by a judge that would mean the child can make decisions about his custodian but remains a minor for all other purposes and cannot make decisions on his own behalf.A second option is to pursue non-parental custody. (### Civil Code Article ###.) In that situation you as a non-parent could request custody of the minor child because leaving custody with the other parent would likely cause substantial harm. This paperwork would have to be filed against the child's mother and father. It has to have specific allegations demonstrating that both parents represent a risk to the child in some fashion. Most often this risk comes as physical danger but can also include substantial periods of neglect or abandonment. The other side of this of course is a showing that the person requesting custody can demonstrate that they are better suited to care for the child's need and provide for the safety and stability of the child.Without knowing more about your specific situation I don't know which option makes the most sense or seems the most realistic. If you have additional questions you're more than welcome to follow up here.

The court may allow you to proceed without paying the costs upfront or may waive the filing fees in whole or in part.If you have access to a public library (either in person or online); you can go to the online database "###" legal database. Search for a sample Petition for Emancipation. The librarian can likely help you.Library is also a place to be able to print out forms.Always bring at least ###.At a minimum you should keep with one "stamped" (aka "###") copy.Court personnel are not permitted to give legal advice.There are two ways to obtain emancipation.  It would depend on what is required by the social service agencies.(The third way is by the minor getting married).Quickest way if accepted by social service agencies landlords etc.  The first is a limited emancipation that is a document ("authentic act") that is signed by the minor and the parents) before a notary. I attach a sample form (cannot attach a ### form on this website).  Legal size paper.  A notary service in ### Parish may be able to assist. It becomes effective when it is signed by all parties.

Limited emancipation by authentic actAn authentic act of limited emancipation confers upon a minor age sixteen or older the capacity to make the kinds of juridical acts specified therein unless otherwise provided by law.  The act shall be executed by the minor and by the parents of the minor if parental authority exists or by the tutor of the minor if parental authority does not exist.  All other effects of minority shall continue.Acts 2008 No. ### Â§### eff. ###. ### 2009.Art. 37###.  Modification or termination of limited emancipation by authentic act  (IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THINGS LATER)The parties to an authentic act of limited emancipation may modify or terminate the limited emancipation by making a subsequent authentic act.  In addition a court for good cause may modify or terminate limited emancipation by authentic act.An authentic act or judgment modifying or terminating limited emancipation by authentic act is effective toward third persons as to immovable property when the act or judgment is filed for registry in the conveyance records of the parish in which the property is situated and as to ### when the act or judgment is filed for registry in the conveyance records in the parish or parishes in which the minor was domiciled at the time of the act modifying or terminating limited emancipation by authentic act.An authentic act or judgment modifying or terminating a prior act of limited emancipation does not affect the validity of a juridical act made by the minor prior to the effective date of modification or termination.Acts 2008 No. ### Â§### eff. ###. ### 2009.The second would be to file a Petition for Emancipation with the ### Parish Clerk of Court.The minor goes before the judge and explains why they need/want to be emancipation.

The minor cannot file the petition with the court.  An adult friend must file the petition on behalf the minor. The friend may be a parent or another adult. It can't be the attorney hired to represent the minor.The adult friend that is chosen (or the minorâ€™s attorney) will prepare a petition asking the judge to remove the disability of minority, stating the minor's name, the names and residences of the parents or next of kin and the reason for seeking emancipation.  The petition must be filed in the chancery court in the county where the minor lives.

The petitioner may be a parent or another adult. The adult or the adultâ€™s attorney should prepare the petition asking the court to remove the disability of minority, stating the minor's name, the names and residences of the parents or next of kin and the reason for seeking emancipation.

Then in my adult life they have become my stalkers. I had a health care power of attorney set up but when I was in a coma the hospital did not know it excised and allowed my parents to make decisions for me and be in the room with me so vulnerable. I felt like they raped me all over again. Now they got someone to lie to DCF which got my daughter removed so I cannot prevent them as child rapist from having access to her. I know as an adult this would be unusual but I was to get someone else to adopt me or divorce them in some way legally. They are very dangerous people who had my best friend killed and me drugged and raped for weeks as an adult in the exact manner they abused me as a child.  I must remove any grandparent rights they have.43685.1013888889 ###. Father passed away and mother lives in Haiti. He currently lives with an aunt who does not have legal guardianship but takes care of him. This minor was involved with the law for sharing a video of child pornography with a friend and was put on probation for ###. The minor has been granted permission to leave the country to go spend time with his mother. However now that heâ€™s there, the mother refuses to send him back to continue his probation. My question is can legal actions be taken against the aunt since the child will not return to Florida. And what can happen to the minor if he doesnâ€™t come back to finish his probation? the minor has been on probation for about ###. 43701.7666666667 Good morning:  Based solely on what you have told me, there are no civil actions which may be taken successfully against the aunt.  This site does not answer criminal questions so I can not provide any opinion as to those issues, if any.43703.4826388889 After my mom was buried my mom's sister wrote my sister and I ###'s account and signed it fiduciary .. I find out latter she wrote all ### $10',###. My aunt has custody of one of mom's grand daughters. My mom had no will  . The reason she had a fiduciary is because she has dementia and was considered mentally incompetent . How is it legal for my aunt to do this to my sister and I ?44360.75 At the surface, it seems that your mother's estate should have been divided equally between you and your sister.  Fiduciaries/powers of attorney end at a person's death. An executor should have been appointed to probate her estate after she died.It's possible that there were some accounts that were made joint accounts with your aunt or that she was the designated payee on death to do with what she wished. However, then she may have kept the money. The way it was distributed does not sound right.  I would contact a probate lawyer in your area to see what can be done to open a probate estate now.  Keep in mind though, that money would likely have to be taken from the grandchildren and redistributed to you and if they have spent it, that may be difficult.I would first call the clerk's office for the chancery court in your county and ask if your mother's estate was ever probated.  If it was, ask for a copy of the file  It doesn't sound like it was though. It sounds like your aunt thought she could distribute the money the way she wanted to because she had control of your mother's money while she was alive. Did you ever ask her why she distributed it the way she did?  Maybe she had a document from your mother directing her to distribute it as she saw fit?44360.8847222222 It doesn't make since there would be any documents signed by my mom she had dementia and found mentally incompetent by the VA is which the need of a fiduciary. My father was the fiduciary before he died. . Also my aunt has custody of one of her granddaughters .44361.2861111111 My son is a ###, high school graduate who is currently in boot camp for the Army. Does the state of Tennessee recognize him as being emancipated because of him being active duty military? He left home on ###nd and will not return until after his 18th birthday in ###. I pay child support payments through the state and I would rather use the money that I send his mother for something else. I only have ###. (June-September) I just need a Tennessee Code or Case number that states that Tennessee automatically emancipates a minor who has joined the military if one exists. I also need to know, if emancipation is automatic, when does emancipation begin: the day he left for boot camp or the day he completes boot camp.44361.9319444444 There is an appellate court opinion in Tennessee [### ###. ###, ###.W.2d ###, ### (Tenn. App. ###)] that held that a minor is emancipated by enlisting in military service.44368.8611111111 This is not an open scenario meaning I do have a case or anything, nor has this happened to me, more of a curious question that would be helpful for other people to know, specifically college students. I just watched a documentary on a college kid who passed away from alcohol poisoning because they were too scared to reach out. Because of that, I know many states have put in place a medical amnesty for if an underage drinker needed to get medical help, that person and/or the caller would not be charged, therefore, it saved many lives because students weren't as scared to reach out. I have heard that Tennessee does not provide that so I was curious as to if that is wrong and there is some sort of amnesty or if that person reaches out for help would they still get charged after the medical component was fixed? I hope that makes sense!44407.7798611111 We appreciate your interest the subject.  Go online and review Tennessee Code Section 63-1-###, including the policy at the University of Tennessee.44413.8840277778 We have a ### ###â€™s custodial parent and only a few visits during that time.  The child is trying to register for school and needs proof of residency from custodial parent.  Custodial parent is refusing to provide proof of residency and has cut communication with the child and the childâ€™s school.  We cannot provide proof of residency because we do not have guardianship.  We would rather not involve CPS and are looking at helping the child become emancipated, but do not know repercussions or process.  Child is insured by Tenncare and would need to keep that insurance.44410.7701388889 An adult on behalf of the minor, not the minor, must file the emancipation petition in the Chancery Court in the county where the minor resides. The petitioner may be a parent or another adult. The adult or the adultâ€™s attorney should prepare the petition asking the court to remove the disability of minority, stating the minor's name, the names and residences of the parents or next of kin and the reason for seeking emancipation. The court will conduct a hearing to consider the evidence and determine if granting the petition is in the best interests of the minor.  There is a filing fee, but if the minor can't afford to pay the filing fee, a waiver can be requested.44482.8333333333 Hi, looking for any and all information on emancipation. Iâ€™m looking to get the process started and would like all of the steps on what I can do. I understand I have to be moved out, have a job, pay for rent any my own insurance food as well. Now I need to know what I need to do before doing those things. To move, I have some where out of state I can relocate to, but parents would not sign off on that so unsure of what to do 44482.8236111111 It is likely that a court would require proof of ### ability to sustain ### self before terminating the parentsâ€™ obligations.44482.8430555556 Iâ€™ve been told to start that I have to be moved out and working and paying my bills, but without my parents consent to moving out how can I do that without them calling the cops on me for â€œrunning awayâ€44482.8361111111 Living with your parents or not living with your parents is a matter between you and your parents at least until a court enters an order that you are emancipated and probably thereafter.44483.7395833333 So if I have a job and have somewhere to live I can go ahead and move out and start the process? Or will there be a issue with out the parents consent for moving out 44482.8527777778 So the process of emancipation  has to be started before I can move out of my parents house. Because I have a place to move to and a job waiting for me 44483.6395833333 Your adult friend can start the process, but you will be emancipated if and when a court enters an order of emancipation.  We assume that the court will require satisfactory evidence that, among other matters, you have a safe and secure place to live if you were to move away from your parentsâ€™ home. 44483.5784722222 As the â€œnext friendâ€ filing for emancipation, where can I find the forms to file for Knoxville TN Iâ€™ve looked online everywhere and canâ€™t find any 44485.7256944444 There are not forms to fill out for every legal filing.  Documents are usually written by attorneys. You should consult with a local attorney in your area or perhaps Legal Aid if you cannot afford an attorney.44486.10625 You should also contact the Juvenile Court Clerk's Office in your area.  They may be able to point you in the right direction as to the paperwork that they need for an emancipation petition.44487.9458333333 In ###.

However, a minor can emancipate themselves through a burdensome court proceeding that would require an attorney to help you.  There is a process for it but she would need to hire and pay a lawyer.  It would be difficult.43889.7805555556 Mother has physical custody. Her and her mother can't get along.  She wants to emancipate herself. 43886.6208333333 Good morning:  You are represented by counsel.  It would be improper for us to instruct you on how to undercut his or her efforts on your behalf.

Sounds to me as if this is entirely coming from you, not her. Normally, courts consider emancipation of a minor on the child's petition, and they must be financially independent, something that doesn't seem to fit this scenario. When a child is emancipated, it means they are legally an adult with all of the ramifications, as if they turned the age of ###.  So, with that, comes all of the consequences o being  a legal adult.43846.6444444444 I am actually aware of this independent action for fraud even past the one year time limit for a motion for relief from judgment.

I believe that if you show the judge that your parents do not support you and are unable to qualify for financial aid for school, you will be granted an emancipation.  It is also possible to get a limited emancipation; for example, it could be limited to an emancipation for financial assistance related to education.  I would suggest that you contact someone with fafsa to make sure what requirements they have regarding the emancipation.I hope this is helpful.  Please let me know if you have other questions or want additional assistance.###43578.8145833333 My parents were not financially able to support me, or my schooling. I moved out, I have a job, and I pay for housing, health care, schooling, etc. myself. Although I have read on most websites that I should be employed full time, but I am not. I cannot complete my fafsa, nor any financial aid for that matter, due to the fact that I am still linked to my parents, so is that an appropriate reason for emancipation?

This rule in the lease is one of the reasons I felt comfortable moving here. However, I have been complaining since October about marijuana smoke/scent entering my apartment from other tenants that smoke. I have stated on several occasions that I have bad allergies and the smoke bothers me. My son as asthma and he has now been put on two inhalers and has been referred to a lung specialist. When a tenant smokes, it enters my apartment thru my vents. I sometimes turn my AC on when I make it home, and the fumes fill my apartment. I have complained to the manager along with the owner. The only thing I am being told is they canâ€™t stop anyone from smoking. An office employee has smelled the smell, two maintenance guys has smelled it, along with an police officer. The landlord will not enforce the lease. They have threatened to put people out for loud music, and will not enforce the illegal drug issue. The manager stated if she put everyone out that smokes marijuana, they wouldnâ€™t have tenants. She also stated that she knows tenants smoke marijuana. I feel like the lease is false advertisement and this apartment is a hazard to my health as well as my ### ###. Is there anything that I can do about this situation? I have text messages to the complex thatâ€™s been ignored, I have a police report and notes from my doctor as well as my sonâ€™s doctor stating his condition. I also have a video of the manager stating she knows her tenants smoke marijuana. I have a ### of my lease as well stating that itâ€™s not supposed to be on the property for any reason. 44446.8555555556 If the lease states that drugs are not allowed and you decide to move because of the impact of smoke on your/your son's health, then you should not be held to be in breach of your lease if you move early.  You should get the landlord's agreement to move out before the expiration of your lease, if you choose to do so, asking to be released from any remaining lease obligations/to be held harmless from moving out early and have any deposit returned to you, assuming you've satisfied other conditions of your lease.  As a practical matter, you likely cannot force your landlord to prevent other tenants from using drugs in their apartments. 44497.65625 Thanks!44497.6611111111 Ms. ###,You can get help with the forms you will need and the process at this website.

The obligation may continue beyond age ###.Much will depend upon how the court order directing you to pay support was worded.  If it says it terminates at age ###, or (some other language modifying the age ###, like age 19, if the child is still in school with a reasonable expectation of graduation before age 19,) then your smartest move would be to file your supplemental petition.  Otherwise, the clerk's office or the child support division will have no way to determine from the face of the record whether all of the events have occurred which would terminate the support.  When in doubt, always do more rather than less, to assure you don't pay more than you are required.  So, I would file the supplemental petition to make sure.  Of course, you have to make sure that all conditions required in order to mandate the termination of support have occurred or will occur on your child's ###th birthday.Here's where to start:  ###Good luck. 43891.5166666667 One of my children are turning ###in order to  modify/reduce the support payment does the court provide the required  form/s and where can the required forms be found.43891.0875 Good morning,My son has lived in one state his entire life, ###. I myself have moved to ### for a few years and then back to ###. I should never have had ###. When I did some digging myself and contacted child support in Maryland they realized the mistake and immediately closed my case.Now the situation in ### I completely understand that I owe a large payment and my arrears is being paid with every paycheck however payments are not correctly showing up on my credit report. Speaking to them a little bit more this week after Iâ€™ve written you this question The amount that ### in arrears is not the amount that showing up on my credit report and the amount that showing up on my credit report is also not budging when payments are being sent in. Now when I spoke to someone yesterday they told me they donâ€™t understand why thereâ€™s a separation from the amount on my actual credit report and the amount that actually owed. And when speaking to someone from there they told me that even if I was to pay that $###â€™s no guarantee that that will show as paid or even adjust with that payment. I just want my report to reflect whatâ€™s actually happening with these payments. Even with depts they reflect payments.44174.6833333333 I currently owe arrears on my child support. I AM NOT currently on child support, I actually have full custody of my son and have for the last ###. I want to get a house one day for my family but Iâ€™m trying to build my credit and even go for a personal loan however no credit cards or loans will even consider a line of credit because even though for the last two years I have been paying on my backpay through garnishment of my checks, income tax and stimulus checks it has not been reported correctly to the credit bureau from child support. I have disputed this through the bureaus several times with the same results that it was correct. I have called child support and tried to tell them the issue and I have even had a child support case closed because it was one wrongfully against me in another state. Doing a bit of research I should have only been paying in one state for this one child and I actually got that case closed. When I speak to the people from child support not only do they keep switching me from department to department, giving me several other numbers to call and even referred me to emails the outcome is always the same. They told me that they are reporting that is being paid on time due to my checks being garnished however there is an â€œoutstandingâ€ balance of $###. When I asked about this and said if I pay this will it go away and I can just continue to pay the arrears from my garnishments they said thereâ€™s no guarantee that that money will go to the $###. It may go to the total amount of 14,###. From my understanding if my payments are being taken out of my check that would be considered being paid on time even if itâ€™s backpay it has been being paid toward this debt on time for the last two years and is not being reported as such. Would I be able to sue child support? I donâ€™t want any money from them and I donâ€™t even need them to take money off of my arrears all I want is for my credit report to be updated, England standing, and to report that I have been paying on time for the last two years. With no late payments and no missed payments.44173.0840277778 Oh ok, that probably just means they didn't report the full amount. While the state does have to report defaults once they hit $1000, they also have the discretion to report a lower amount than what's owed. Should help you quite a bit actually. Having that low a number as a visible collections debt is much better for your credit than having the full $###, especially seeing as the score is based on the ratio between available credit and credit being used. When they put the lower amount on there, it kept your ratio far lower than it would've been otherwise. While you're paying off the arrears, the $###, but doesn't put your usage/debt so high that it would take years to get out from under. According to Experian, ### debts don't go down the same way as regular debts. Every article I've read says the balance changes once it's paid in full:Once paid the account will be updated to show that there is no longer a balance owed but your credit report will continue to reflect the payment history of the account""Once your collection has been paid off your credit reports will be updated to show the account has been paid and reflect the new zero balance""...you will likely have to pay the balance before the bank will approve you for your mortgage loan. Once paid the account will be updated to show that it has been paid in full"It also says it doesn't show wage garnishments on their own but if the account the garnishments are for is on the report the state/creditor can put a note on saying it's being paid through garnishment.From what I've gathered the reason it isn't changing is because it's a collections account which is a different classification than a credit account or loan. While the latter two would keep a running balance and let you build credit something that's labelled on the report as already in ### will stay as is until it's paid off completely at which point it would be "collections- paid in full". It'll take your score down by virtue of it being in collections and the on time payments aren't really on time so they won't help other than by getting it paid off faster. If you have late payments on it those will count and if you default again it's worse. The explanation Experian gives is that it's a "credit history" emphasizing history. So by the time it's in default and goes to collections it's already an old account and had its chance to be paid on time when each payment was originally due. After it's paid in full and goes to a zero balance it'll still be visible on the report but it won't necessarily count against you. There's apparently a few different types of credit reporting/searching and the newer ones don't count paid off defaults as negative. The older ones may still see the default alone as a liability regardless of whether it has a zero balance. "44176.3847222222 Sue SED for what? Everything you've said sounds like they're doing it exactly as they're supposed to. The arrears will stay on your credit report and continue holding your score down until ###'re paid in full. Paying an enforcement action on time via garnishment may show up as regularly made payments now, but the debt itself was from a default and the payments are still at least two years past due. Once there's a debt, there's a due date. The credit report gets the original due date that the state reports (typically it's the last time you made a payment towards the child support before defaulting). It doesn't change that original missed due date to reflect any new deals or garnishment that forces the payments to be on time per collections action. They'll be able to see it and figure out that you're now settling an old default, maybe even tag it as a new arrangement to pay the defaulted amount, but that doesn't by any stretch of the imagination make it on time" even if your current payments are scheduled- on time payments would never have made it to arrears. That won't go away until seven years after it's completely paid off. There's nothing support enforcement can do about that until you pay it off and that's the full $###4k in arrears not just the $###'t sound like it's even in collections yet. Regular payments without extra gaps in between may give you a few points eventually but having a default reported and getting enforcement actions taken against you is not even in the same ballpark as paying an account on time.The debt itself will show up classified as either "collections" or "judgment". That alone will knock your credit down about ###. The state has to report unpaid child support once it hits $###000 but they have to notify you first. Once they decided to report it you would've gotten a letter saying the amount in arrears and you'd have had information in the paperwork on how to ask for a hearing to challenge the amount owed. One potential outcome of challenging the amount owed is that less of the debt might be reported. Or you could've made arrangements to pay before they ### to garnishment. The state has to report to credit agencies but there is some discretion if the debtor makes a good faith effort to catch up without the state having to garnish wages or seize accounts. If it's just back support it gets off the credit report within a month of it being paid off per CT rules.I can't find a docket with your name on it so I'm assuming the child was out of state and that state had the custody and support order originally? You shouldn't have been paying the same thing to multiple states it's unclear how that happened unless the child was on state services in both states so they'd both consider you to owe them the reimbursement for that or you defaulted in both states so both can try to collect. Assuming the support order was through whichever other state it would be that state's rules that apply to the withholding until the child's home state is changed the custody agreement moves to a new jurisdiction and the support order is modified in accordance with the new state's laws.Not knowing what the other state is or what the docket looks like all I can say is that if the $### then it sounds like it's probably back support. That could've started accruing between the first garnished payments and you getting custody so it may not be to the point of arrears in judgment yet. 20% of the imputed support payment each month would go towards the arrears unless you're no more than 250% over the poverty line. In the latter case because you live with the child for whom support is owed you'd be paying $###. Assuming the $### 20% of your payment towards that would get rerouted to the arrears. Unless your income is low enough for it to be $###.Don't expect anyone to be willing to give you a mortgage until the total amount due is below $500. Anything over $###'t simply look bad on your credit it's subject to liens. Meaning if someone decided to give you a mortgage the state could put a lien on the house and foreclose for the remaining $###4k. That too would be subject to a hearing then foreclosure rules so it's not going to be easy for the state to do but it's an option. Any mortgage or loan over $50k is going to see that arrearage and consider you a liability- not just that you've got a proven history of not paying obligations but also because the state could claim their interest at any time making it already look like any loan they give you won't be paid back."44174.6541666667 Cont'd informationI do not want D to stay with Friends but would rather that she be able to stay with me and have her Mother's house as a place she can stay when needed.If she isn't able to stay at all with M, either because M is not taking her back and there are no legal remedies or because D does not wish to stay with M at all, then I would like for D to stay with me permanentlyNot sure what implications if any this would have with her schooling (please advise)I have discussed the option of moving to a distance learning schedule until the final marking period of the school year at which time I could either secure a residence within D's school district or make arrangements for transportation.D is in her Senior yr of ### and has been accepted to multiple Universities and plans to attend college for the Fall semester of this year (2021)44251.8979166667 Details:My ### (D) left her Mother's (M) house approx around ### on ###.Whether D ran away or was kicked out is unclear at this timeI was not aware that D had left ### house until around noon on Sunday ###/### D stayed at a friend's (BF) house on the nights of ###/### ###/###0Upon learning of the situation on Sunday ###/###1; I picked D up from BF's house.D stayed with me for one night (###/###1).D is currently in a hybrid school schedule (this week she attends Tuesday/Thursday, next week ###.)At D's request (and against my request), I dropped D off to another Friend's house (###) on ###nd, whom attends school on the same hybrid school schedule as D.D stayed at ###'s house overnight on ###/### ###/###3.D also stayed at ###'s house the night of ###/###3.D is now planning to stay at BF's house for the night of ###/### ###/###5.

With distance learning as an option it might be unnecessary to move especially seeing as she's a senior in her last semester and will be going away to school in the fall.

My suggestion is while he is on probation ask his probation officer if the court would added while he is on probation appoint you as a guardian this allows you to help him with any drug issues, medical issues, injuries or school issues or with the Department of Motor Vehicles.Since the rate is high for falling back into drugs Instead of emancipation, you apply for a guardianship to help him with issues he is going to face down the road . You obviously have good guidance and insight to get him out of a atmosphere of drugs this part of his life. The teenage years are the most challenging in getting through.  43410.7055555556 Here is the form for Juvenile Petition for Emancipation which you can check out if appropriate43410.95625 I have a close friend who has been away from his legal guardian since ######.
