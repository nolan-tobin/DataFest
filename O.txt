Can that ruling be appealed ?43636.7819444444 Mr. ###:It depends on whether the arbitration was in or outside litigation.  In almost all instances when the arbitration is held outside of a lawsuit (in other words, private arbitration), the arbitrator's decision is final and cannot be appealed to a court or other authority, unless the arbitrator rules otherwise, or the two parties to arbitration agree otherwise.  Unless those rare exceptions apply here, the arbitrator's decision is final.If this is in District Court as part of a lawsuit, the arbitrator's decision is ###, and can be appealed to the District Court judge.  Judges tend to defer to arbitration decisions so long as there is no manifestly obvious abuse of discretion or ###.  So far, it looks like you are in good shape, but if this is part of a lawsuit, the fight might last a little longer.  If there are to be subsequent hearings before the District Court judge on this matter, you will receive Notices of Hearing at least ten days before the hearing dates, and that will afford you time to prepare accordingly.I wish you the best for a fair and acceptable outcome that will allow you to ### move forward with your life.

He can voluntarily acknowledge paternity in most cases.  You may try calling ### to ask about paternity matters.43679.6951388889 Hi. I am an adult and trying to go through the process to get my fathers name added to my birth certificate. I was told by vital statistics that I need to file a court order. I called the clerk of court and she says she doesnâ€™t know what I need to file. Can anyone provide any insight to a form, paperwork or steps I need to take?43640.6493055556 I am not sure what you are charged with, but if it involves the possibility of an intent to defraud, I would not suggest that you face your charges unrepresented.  During your first appearance, you should request a Court Appointed lawyer to represent you.  If you do not like the attorney appointed for you, you can always decide to replace him/her with an attorney you hire.  Unfortunately, it does not work in the reverse.  If you waive your right to a court appointed lawyer during your first appearance and then decide that you are unable to hire an attorney, you do not get to change your mind and get the court appointed lawyer.  Your attorney will be able to obtain Discovery" (the evidence the DA has against you.)I hope this information helps."43644.9277777778 When and how can I see the evidence against me after the district attorney has decided to prosecute?What would a Court consider proof of intent to defraud?When must one choose to plea guilty or not guily?43641.6756944444 My minor sonâ€™s pediatrician office diagnosed him with constipation, but that was not the case. I called the exact minute they opened, but was giving the â€œearliest availableâ€ appointment for ###. Long story short, my son had to have a testicle removed. I have contacted lawyers before and one told me that this case would be difficult to win. My question is, Is this something I should try to settle or should I try a civil lawsuit instead? It has been difficult finding a lawyer that is willing to take on this task.43642.0215277778 Thank you for your question.  I am very sorry for what you have been through with regard to your son's medical care.  It sounds like you have concerns regarding medical care your son received and that the situation ended with him having to have a testicle removed.  You have asked if you should try to settle this or try a civil lawsuit.  NC has very specific laws regarding civil liability for medical malpractice.  Technically, individuals can handle medical malpractice claims without an attorney.  But because of the significant and particular requirements of our state's law regarding these type claims, it is very difficult to handle these on your own without an attorney.  There also are important deadlines related to these legal claims.  For these reasons, you should consult an attorney as soon as possible if you have any further interest in investigating the possibility of a legal claim related to your son's care.  If you are having difficulty obtaining a lawyer, you can consult the NCBA Lawyer Referral Service.  If you want to try to handle this without a lawyer, you can contact the Risk Manager for the medical practice whose care is at issue.  They may refer you to the liability insurance company for their practice.  And again, this type of approach is risky because of deadlines and because of a lay person's lack of familiarity with the specific requirements of medical malpractice law.  But it is possible.  Best of luck to you and to your son. 43647.7083333333 Hello my name is ### ### I just have some questions regarding my landlord. He shows up to my house when I have company and knocks to see who it is, he shows up and moves my belongings around with no notice. Is he allowed to do that? 43647.55 Hello, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  I hope you have had a good summer so far.  No, your landlord cannot do this.  As the tenant, you have the right to exclusive possession and quiet enjoyment" during the duration of your lease.  The landlord cannot just enter the premises and intrude upon the tenant's privacy at will.  See what your lease says about a landlord's right of entry.  Normally a landlord may enter the premises only for such legitimate purposes as making repairs conducting periodic (not repeated) inspections and showing the premises to prospective buyers.  When doing so the landlord is required to furnish "reasonable" advance notice to the tenant which according to most small claims magistrates who hear landlord-tenant cases is at least ###.  Exceptions to this rule can lawfully apply when there is an emergency or exigent circumstance.You might consider hiring a local landlord-tenant lawyer to send your landlord a ### letter of warning advising him to permanently cease and desist fro###y further unreasonable intrusions on your privacy during the lease period.  I hope this ### will come to a stop very soon for your own peace of mind.Blessings to you this summer.### A. ### ### Esq."43659.7104166667 Assuming that your parents are divorced, your mother is not first in line to qualify to administer your father's ### are.  Therefore, you would need to file a Renunciation of your right to Qualify to administer your father's estate and recommend her as the Administrator.  Also, your mother will have to be bonded since she is not an heir of your father's ### are.  If you do not want her to have to be bonded, then you will also need to file a Waiver of Bond.  Although the house/land passed outside of the Estate and you are entitled to manage the land as your own, most Magistrate Judges (Small Claims Court) are not lawyers and do not understand this, and will want to see something official" regarding ownership of the property.  For this reason after your mother qualifies to administer your father's estate it will be easier for her to give written notice to vacate to the tenants you want removed and then bring the eviction action in Small Claims Court if they don't move. When she qualifies at the Clerk's Office she will receive official Letters of Administration which can be shown to the Court during the eviction hearing.  I hope this information helps."43650.8930555556 Good to know, thank you.43654.7729166667 Have been to the Office of the Clerk of Superior Court to qualify to Administer his Estate yet? 43650.7277777778 I am so sorry for the loss of your father. This must be a very difficult time for you.  Only the owner of the property has the right to evict tenants.  Are you the only child of your father?  Was he married at the time of his death?  Were either of his parents living at the time of his death?  Did he leave a Will?  Has an Estate been opened?  These are all questions which will affect a proper response to your question.43650.5840277778 I am the only child, he has not been married for over ###, neither of his parents is alive, he passed intestate, I believe it is open as it is still in my father's name on the tax records.43650.5916666667 I should add, the house is currently in foreclosure (though I'm working towards modifying it) and has a roughly $30,###.43648.91875 My father recently passed away, leaving behind a house in which I and two roommates lived in. I wish to remove these roommates. I gave one a written ### ###th, the other gave me a verbal ### ###th. I'm worried the second person will try something against me. Neither of them had leases with my father, nor have made any payments to me or towards the household in the past ###. The second one has left her dogs here, one of which she never potty trained and has caused damage to the floors. I did move a lot of boxes she had stored in my father's garage into a shed as to access some of my father's possessions I needed for his memorial. Those boxes have been sitting for several years and are likely infested with insects. This individual told me that she has not filed taxes in several years (###) and is paid largely under the table from her workplace in order to avoid taxes. What is my best course of action to protect myself, the estate, and remove these roommates?43648.9152777778 No, and I intend to have my mother administer the estate as she has a motor vehicle and income and is thus able to go to the court meetings. She will be consulting a probate attorney before any of that occur.43650.7375 One last question, for an at-will tenancy, what would be considered the lease agreement date? Would it be the day my father passed and the property became mine? Would it be the beginning of the month? At the beginning of the year? The date the person moved in? (I do not know what date that would be, and that the tenant has been here for six and a half years). The tenant has no agreement with me, and there was no written agreement with my father.43654.6486111111 That gives me a few good things to do research into, thank you. Also good to hear that I am entitled to manage the land as my own. I'll definitely discuss this with relevant parties. Thanks again.43650.9006944444 You don't need a start date.  You can simply say it predated your ownership. 43654.7444444444 Absolutely, Ms. ###.  I appreciate your courtesy and professionalism very much.  I hope your friend can get something worked out soon, so that the worst-case scenario can be avoided.  Thank you for your goodwill and well wishes.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43659.7263888889 Good afternoon to you, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question; I hope your summer is going very well.  Yes, your friend can still be charged and convicted for a drug possession offense, even though someone else in the same situation as he has already pled guilty to the same offense.  If there was p###able cause to support a finding that both persons were involved in the same criminal conduct, it is a legal possibility that both will face criminal consequences, although each person's case might play out differently, since each person has the right to plead or fight the charges, depending on legal strategy.  Hopefully your friend has a good criminal defense lawyer to provide detailed advice on whether it is better to plead or fight the charges before a judge or jury.The type of question you raised can be answered with certainty based only on the specific facts and evidence that the prosecution has against each and every defendant, which is why having criminal defense counsel is so important in order to obtain the best possible outcome (even if the best outcome is not the most desirable from the defendants' points of view).  If either or both defendants cannot afford a lawyer of their own, they should notify the court of their desire to have a court-appointed lawyer or public defender for them.  I wish both defendants the best in this matter.(Just in case your friend is interested, I recommend ### ###, a criminal defense lawyer based in ###, of the firm ### & Van Hoy.  If he decides to reach out to ###, tell him to inform ### that his former law clerk, ### ###inson, highly recommended ### to your friend.  He can be reached at ###-###, or ### .)God bless you and your family this summer.### A. ###inson, ###, Esq.43659.71875 I have a friend who is incarcerated. He has a drug possession charge.

I appreciate u taking the time to reply to me and I will surely let him know about your recommendation. He had a court appointed attorney but the attorney resigned from his case so as of right now he does not have legal counsel.

I hope you and your family have a wonderful summer as well!!43659.7243055556 How do i file a heart ### lawsuit? Do i need an attorney to do so?43653.775 You do not have to have an attorney so long as you know how to prepare the documents yourself.  To institute the action, you would draft a Complaint, outlining the appropriate elements found in the General Statutes, and the corresponding facts for each element.  You would also need a Civil Action Cover Sheet, Civil Summons for each defendant, and Servicemembers Affidavit for each defendant.  After you file the action in the Clerk's Office, you must serve" the defendant(s) by one of the methods set forth in the General Statutes and file proof of that service in the Clerk's Office.  The Defendant will have ###.  Then you go into the "Discovery" phase.  I won't try to cover that here since you only asked about filing.  Good luck."43654.7895833333 I had a Honda Civic that was never included in the recent air bag recall. While trying to avoid hitting an animal, this car flipped through a ditch into a light pole. During the accident all of the passenger side air bags deployed but none of the driver side air bags functioned. Now I am in a situation where I need to follow up about the injuries acquired but have no transportation or means to do so. I tried reaching out to honda about the appropriate way my car should function in a similar accident and was instructed to google it". How can I go about acquiring "official documentation" about my car's safety ### and how they should function? My concern is that Honda has another air bag issue and the next person may need those driver's side air bags even more so than I needed them."43657.6222222222 Thank you for your question.  I am very sorry about your wreck.  With regard to your concerns and questions about how air bags should have functioned, it could be helpful to consult with a law firm which handles product liability cases.  They will be well suited to investigate existing class action lawsuits related to products, including air bags.  They also will know how to best investigate how your carâ€™s air bags should have operated and whether there is reason to believe you may have legal rights related to this.  If you have difficulty identifying law firms with experience in product liability claims, you also can contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association.  You will find information about this on the NCBA website at ###.   43660.9944444444 Good afternoon, Mr. ###.  I hope your summer is going well.  Yes, I think you can get out of the lease sooner rather than later.  If you and the landlord cannot agree in writing to a modification that releases you from the lease and any further obligation to pay rent, you would need to sue the landlord in small claims court for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, found at N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-4###, and which I have linked here: https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_4###/gs_4###-4###.html.  Pay special attention to Â§ 4###-4###(a)(###) and (###), as well as Â§ 4###-4###(a)(8)(l).  Your remedies would be (###) rent abatement, calculated as fair rental value of premises in good condition, minus fair rental value in defective condition, plus any special damages the tenant sustained as a direct result of the landlord's habitability breach under Â§ 4###-4###, and (###) release fro###y further rental obligations to the landlord.  Note that you will need to offer reasonable estimates in the diminution of fair rental value when it comes to rent abatement; awards of rent abatement for habitability breaches are at the discretion of the small claims magistrate hearing your case.The landlord's liability under N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-### (###) has actual knowledge of the problem, and (###) has had a reasonable" time to cure the defect.  What is "reasonable" is a subjective value judgment that the magistrate will make based on the evidence and the totality of circumstances.The filing fee for small claims court is $96.### plus another $### Office for service of process (complaint and summons) upon the landlord.  The forms for small claims court are available at the courthouse.I wish you and your family the best in navigating through these challenges.  Hopefully you and the landlord can agree to something in writing that prevents a lawsuit from being your next recourse but if not the above answer outlines what you must do to get out of this completely and lawfully.  Note that under N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-44(c) you cannot as the tenant unilaterally withhold rent without court order should the landlord not agree to your paying no or less rent for the periods of the breach.Blessings to you all### A. ### ### Esq."43659.7916666667 We have mold and mildew under our carpet due to negligence of apartment management, we have had our hallway flooded for over ###, we have the list of things that need to be fixed and they are refusing to fix anything  my spouse and I are wondering how we can legally break our lease ?43657.6777777778 Hello,Type of pleading- compliantClaims for relief- Collection on account.How do I request a settlement for a civil action law suit for a major credit card company?What is the least percentage of this amount that the company will settle for?Can I ask for a continued amount of time such as, 60-###?This is a credit card.The suit is for $###.###.Thanks for your help.### ###43657.8368055556 Hey ###, When is your hearing date?

You will need to contact the law firm that represents Discover Bank. They have authority to negotiation on behalf of Discover and settle or set up a payment plan instead. Their information should be on the documents you were served for your court date. You can ask for a continuance, however, the only time I have seen continuances granted, is when ### plans are in their final stages of agreement. They will likely have you sign a consent judgment.

Their main office is in Salisbury North Carolina.  We disclosed the fact that he did not take vaccine shots due to health, allergic, and religious reasons, etc. and they agreed in writing to still allow him to attend.  We had been saving for the trip since he was ###, they changed their mind and would not allow him to play which broke his heart and emotionally scared him.  The first let him into the camp and then called me at about ###:###.  They refused to allow us to even attend the games and threatened me with trespassing and arrest if I came back.  There are ###.  We would like to sue them for our damages and so that they never do this to any child again.  They have made millions of dollars doing this since ###996, and have done it and other things to others as well,  There may be support for a class action suit due to their prior behavior to others as well.  We cannot afford an attorney so the case would have to be taken on a contingency fee or class action basis.  We have been monetarily damaged approximately $###, and my son had to take time off from college to attend.  They lied to the coach of the team and never disclosed that our son could not come and attend prior to our arrival there.  Cooperstown Dreams Park is a corporation our of North Carolina and New York.  It would probably be better to sue them in North Carolina, because that is the office that gave us written permission to attend, and they are a large employer in the Cooperstown area, and an impartial jury pool may be difficult to find.43658.9013888889 There are a lot of barriers to this:It looks like the actual tournament takes place in NY?  The parent kit references NY laws.  NY State laws makes immunization mandatory in schools and other settings and the only exception is if you have a medical provider document the exemption.  Nothing in your summary stated that you got a medical exemption from a doctor who treats your son.Also, to document your child's mental anguish, you're going to need to have a therapist be able to testify to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that your child suffered such anguish.  I never go to court claiming my client suffered mental/emotional distress without having it ### documented by therapy notes.It also sounds like you didn't get any of the exchanges with the organization in writing and that you're relying on what the coach told you so it will be difficult to prove who really said what.  He said vs. he said vs. coach said.  Finally, you have a duty to mitigate damages.  If you didn't spend a week up there, you could have gone back to work, etc. You don't get to claim damages in terms of lost wages if you could have gone back to work or if you otherwise used your time for your own pleasure.You can try to sue in small claims and have the folks in Salisbury served, but small claims is limited to $###.  Here is a guide to small claims: ### I would suggest you limit it to damages you actually suffered like your out of pocket expenses for the tournament, gas, and lodging.This is a consequence of immunizations becoming mandatory, which is generally good for everyone and just creates challenges for individuals who are too medically fragile to receive them.  You should probably consider having his physician complete a medical exemption with respect to immunizations whenever he has a physical so that it is on an annual basis and up to date.Good luck!43734.8395833333 Mrs. ###:I am very sorry to hear of what happened to your husband, and appreciate that this is an ordeal for the both of you.  If this is a medical malpractice case that shows promise and merit, I sincerely believe that you can find a seasoned malpractice lawyer who would be willing to take it; you just have to spend the time in vetting prospective counsel.  With the prospect of winning or settling a recovery against a hospital or a doctor with malpractice insurance, medical malpractice lawyers will take a serious look at this as long as they believe that the evidence and medical records supports a strong finding of negligence by the doctors.  I would contact the North Carolina Bar Association and see if they provide referrals in the medical malpractice area, and you could also use the Find a Lawyer" feature on ###.  Also check with the North Carolina Advocates for Justice.  Many highly successful medical malpractice lawyers provide either free or relatively low-cost consultation fees.  I hope that you can soon find a reputable lawyer who will talk with you about your husband's case in detail and provide you helpful feedback on the viability of your intended lawsuit.Blessings health and renewal to you and your husband during this challenging time.All the best### A. ### ### Esq."43668.1652777778 My husband was hospitalized after getting sick at a restaurant.

In ret###iation, the DAE has had me blacklisted at sever### schools. They have ###so written 14+ letters to the school district accusing me of being a sexu### predator et ###. in an effort to destroy my career. They have had my NEA membership revoked without due process. This has damaged  my reputation and severely impacted my ability to support myself financi###ly.  I presented the idea of a party for DPS custodians to the school board, which was met favorably. Unfortunately, they passed the idea onto the DAE, who had me arrested at the party upon my arriv###. The charge was trespassing. When the arresting officer became convinced (at the police station) that the charge and other accusations were f###se, he advocated for me to the magistrate and the charge was quickly dropped. The HR Department of ### Public Schools  understands that this is nothing more than an attack against me by the DAE and has refused to take action against me. They are worried however, that they may at some point be overruled. The problem of the blacklisting ###so remains, as that is a decision made by princip###s. ###so, each time one of the ### tactics is thwarted, they come up with something else. One of the most recent is an order from the DAE to its members to cancel any assignments that are given to me. I have on a number of occasions arrived at a school only to be turned away. This has caused deep division within the district, as I am well respected among my colleagues, among them administrators, educators, custodians and the like. It ###so helps that I am reliable and very good at what I do. But the DAE has strong ###lies in the school district who are pushing very hard for me to be terminated and worse.

Unfortunately, this is not uncommon, and, it could get worse.  There is never a guarantee that you will be qualified for a hardship refinance.  It is expected that, even though you are not making a payment for ###, you are holding those payments out so that you can pay them in if you are not qualified at the end of the application period.  To make matters worse, if you do not recover the vehicle, they will sell it at auction.  The cars never sell for enough money to pay off your loan so then they will sue you for the balance not paid.  So you will be out a car AND still paying the bank.  I wish I had better news.43663.8159722222 i applies for a hardship refinance with Wellsfargo. They required I be over ###.

This just seemed so messed up and wrong on so many levels knowing my hardship. Now they are demanding full payment plus repossession fees for my vehicle 43662.9722222222 Good Saturday afternoon to you, Ms. ###:Thank you for this important question, and I hope your summer is going well.  I think a lawyer would need to actually read the entire contract and ### its language before providing you with a definite answer.  It sounds like you may be on good, strong ground legally, based on your description of what the contract arrangement is, but again, it would be risky for a lawyer to advise that you are in the clear without benefit of reading the contract and ### it with facts you could provide.  I think a brief (maybe ###?) consultation on the issue would provide the final clarity you need.  The lawyer could review the contract either ahead of an in-person meeting, or do so by phone once s/he has read a copy by email or mail.  I think most lawyers in ###, Orange and ### Counties who provide contract analyses would do this for a relatively inexpensive fee.  Once a good lawyer has reviewed everything, I think you would receive a solid answer that you could rely upon.I hope everything works out well for you in getting through this.  Have a blessed remainder of this summer.  I wish you the very best.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43666.8458333333 I have a client who seeks ###-###. It is a trust account that funds are coming out of.

I am very sorry about the complications and health issues you have experienced since the surgery you referenced in your question.  You have asked how to file a medical malpractice lawsuit by yourself without an attorney.  It is not impossible to represent yourself in filing a medical malpractice lawsuit but it is very challenging to do so.  One of the reasons is that there are very specific requirements in North Carolina law regarding a required ### review that must be conducted by an appropriately qualified medical expert prior to the filing of the lawsuit and particular requirements about how that review is to be conducted and how the review must be referred to in the lawsuit paperwork known as the Complaint.  For that reason, it is best to be represented by an attorney.  And if one is going to represent themselves in filing a medical malpractice lawsuit, it would be best to consult with an attorney directly for advice about how to do that.  It would be challenging to describe all of the requirements in this email format.  So I believe the best advice to give now is to alert you that these specific requirements exist and urge you to seek legal representation in the case or at least as a consultation prior to representing yourself to advise you about the specific legal requirements for filing a lawsuit. If you are unable to find an attorney to represent you, you may consider contacting the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association.  You can find information about that on the NC Bar Associationâ€™s website.Generally, I can advise you that a person filing a medical malpractice lawsuit has the burden of proving that the medical care they received was negligent.  One of the issues in determining that is whether the medical care complied with the applicable standards of practice.  That is the subject of the ### review that is required by an appropriately qualified medical expert.  A person bringing a medical malpractice lawsuit also must prove that they suffered injury as a result of the medical negligence.  Both of these issues typically involve expert witness testimony in the lawsuit.  One issue often addressed in malpractice cases involving a surgery is whether the complication or injury experienced from the surgery was a result of negligence or whether it was an accepted risk of the surgery addressed in the informed consent obtained prior to the surgery.  Again, thank you for your question.  I hope this general information is helpful, including the recommendation to consult directly with an attorney about this area of law which is complex.  There also are important deadlines related to medical malpractice cases.  That is another reason to consult with an attorney as soon as possible.  An attorney can advise you about these deadlines after a careful review and consideration of the particular facts and records involved in your case.Good luck to you with regard to your health and with regard to the evaluation of your potential legal rights related to the health care you received.43669.4951388889 Thank you for your response.  I am very sorry for the challenges you have faced with regard to your health issues and with regard to your concerns regarding the medical care you received and the potential legal issues involved.  I wish you the best with all these matters.43671.5145833333 I bought a new car ### power train warranty. The clutch failed and needed to be replaced, the dealership assured me that it was covered. After I sent it to them, they said it was not covered and I would have to put 1000$ down to fix it. I told them I would get back to them and then found someone cheaper, when they went to pick up the vehicle they were told the work was already done and they won't release the vehicle until I paid ###$. I never told them to do the work and never paid the deposit. I told them I could only pay 500$ a month. They said ok. Then later said I would also be changed 35$ a day storage so I would add ###$ a month to the ###. Since then I had the vehicle repossessed because I couldn't pay for it. Can I sue the dealership for not covering the warranty and doing the work without permission, not allowing me to have the work done somewhere else43668.6722222222 I would recommend you contact the North Carolina Attorney General's Office at ###. The staff there can assist with complaints about auto sales and/or car repair. You can find out more before you call by visiting the North Carolina Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division's automobiles page at ###.43690.7326388889 Our family had two deaths occur and we used a company called Home to Home to handle an estate sale. They completely misled us as to what was covered by their contract. We were told that clean out was covered by their 50% commission but then they charged us over ### (100.###). They were supposed to give us an itemized inventory but the inventory gave no info about what items sold for, so there is no record of what proceeds the sale produced. They told us we could include items belonging to our family in the sale. We were not paid for these items. And, they said we would receive receipts for charitable donations but they did not include any info about what was donated. According to them, the sale only generated about ###. So, after they kept half of that amount and added what they billed us for clean out, they still say we owe them close to ###. There is no money in the estate to hire an attorney. What are our legal options? 43668.8777777778 Thank you for your question.  I am very sorry about the situation that has occurred with regard to the estate sale.  There are several options available to you to consider.  One is to contact agencies in your area that deal with consumer complaints.  There may be online resources to identify these agencies and entities that offer consumers an opportunity to complain about a local business.  Also, you may utilize the small claims court in your county to pursue your legal rights.  Many people pursue small claims courts matters without an attorney.  An important issue will be whether you have a written contract or document related to the estate sale conducted by the company.  Written terms in a contract will govern some of these issues you mentioned.  If you have such a document or contract, you may want to have it reviewed by an attorney.  If there are limited funds available to do this, you may want to contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association.  You can find contact information on the NC Bar Association website.  This will allow a consultation with an attorney for a small fee.  This situation also could involve the company pursuing its claim for the additional money they say is owed to them.  For that reason, I would recommend consulting with an attorney before pursuing a small claims court matter as the company could file a counterclaim for that amount in small claims court.  This case could involve issues of contract law and also issues related to estates.  The Lawyer Referral Service may help you identify an attorney qualified to address these issues.  Good luck to you.43671.5222222222 Thank you. We have filed complaints with the Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau. And, we have a court date in small claims court on ###.

Is the plaintiff the credit card company or the law firm? It may be possible the law firm has changed or somehow a creditor has sold your debt.

Good luck###"43669.5597222222 I recently went to arbitration over ###. The arbitrator awarded the plaintiff zero . They couldnâ€™t prove the debt and didnâ€™t have the affidavit. I just received notice of a trial de ###. To my understanding an appeal must be made within thirty days of the original decision. On the notice it lists the incorrect plaintiff . Would that negate the notice entirely since the plaintiff is not correct ? Iâ€™m thinking since listing the incorrect plaintiff that would negate the request for a new trial and put them outside the window of appeal.43668.9381944444 The original plaintiff was discover bank C/O (lawyer group)the trial de ### now lists American Express C/O( lawyer group). I donâ€™t have any American Express accounts in any bad standing. I think they simply made a mistake by listing the incorrect plaintiff. The lawyer group is the same. Would could I file for dismissal based on the plaintiff being incorrect ?43669.5659722222 There is likely the a firm representing said discover / american express. I would think it is listed on the paperwork. Corporations cannot represent themselves in court, they legally must hire a separate firm. To your point, the law firm may have made a clerical error. If they did make a mistake, than yes, this is likely grounds for a continuance / dismissal. However, that is not a guarantee. It may be a decent strategy for prolonging the time you have to settle with the plaintiff. The firm may bring a new case if dismissed, or amend certain motions if continued. One of the two is highly likely to happen (that is if you are correct). You may bring it up through filing a motion or presenting a motion at your court date. 43670.6666666667 I had a general question and not sure if this can be asked but how are processes â€œgenerallyâ€ handled if a deadline is not met basically the judge was wanting answers to things in question from the DA and the the DA asked for an extension that the judge never granted or denied.

For starters, get a copy of the actual MaxCare policy.  It is essentially a contract, which sets forth what the parties must do, and under what circumstances.  It likely sets out an arbitration provision, that is triggered under certain circumstances.  That may or may not have happened yet.  I would provide them with written communication setting forth your grievances.  Provide documentation and the evidence. That should spark some sort of action.  43704.6909722222 Hello,I have a car warranty through MaxCare. ###-17, ### ###. This shop was referred to me by MaxCare. On ### my transmission needed to be replaced again after breaking down in ###, and I got it back to my home ###. MaxCare requires the repair shops they refer, to have a ###/12,###, which my car had not exceeded. This makes the repair shop financially responsible. So on ###, Bravo ###. However, instead of submitting the repair claim to MaxCare as is protocol, the mechanic, ###, decided to not to. I called him multiple times to check the status of the repairs, and he told me he was waiting on the claim to be approved by MaxCare. On ###, I called MaxCare to see why the repair claim had not yet been approved, and they informed me that he never submitted a new claim and they had no idea he had been in possession of my car since ###. At my house, we have the Ring camera that shows his employee and tow truck picking up my car. I also record all important phone calls, so I have everything he told me and everything I spoke with MaxCare about how to resolve this issue saved. Now that it is after ### (the ###), he is no longer financially responsible for replacing my transmission. I do not trust this man and refuse to let him do any work on my car. I was working, but because he lied to me about everything I was unable to plan accordingly for rides to and from my job, and subsequently lost my job. ### MaxCare got an adjuster to call him to see what he is doing, since I made them aware that he had my car. He told them he was sending the car to the ### dealership where he bought the parts last year for the replacement transmission he put in. However, that was also a lie. I went to the ### dealership ### and they informed me that my car had been there since ### and was ready for him to pick back up. As of today, ### he has my car again and my warranty company has still not helped me to get my car away from him in any way. I cannot even call the police and file a report about this situation because itâ€™s not like he stole my car. I have already lost too much and I have no other options than to sue. I have a lot of evidence against the repair shop and possibly MaxCare as well. I attached a picture of the original repair receipt from ###.In your legal opinion, do I have a case?43670.7604166667 Hello, Ms. ###:I hope you are having a good weekend and summer.  Yes, based on what you have written here, it does appear that you are entitled to monetary or other adequate relief under these facts.  Assuming that the damage was not under an exculpatory clause in the contract, and that the damage was not incidental to removing the trees according to normal industry standards, you would be entitled to either the monetary value of the vegetation removed, or a suitable replacement, depending on what you find most acceptable.  If you elect to resolve this privately in a negotiation, you might induce the co###y to perform work rectifying your property as best as possible; if on the other hand, litigation is pursued, you would be limited to the value of the contract price for a refund, plus any special damages incurred as a result of the co###y's deficient work on your property.  If the value of damages you can prove is $10,###, small claims court is your option, and you would need to sue in the county where the business is located.  (Filing fee is $###, and the Sheriff's service of process fee is $###.)  The forms for small claims can be found at your local courthouse, and at ### (search under Forms" and most likely "Complaint for Money Owed" would be the template most appropriate for this situation).  If however your alleged damages exceed $100 you should consult with a local civil litigation lawyer about whether filing a lawsuit in District Court or Superior Court is more appropriate (the former is up to $250 and the latter above that amount).If you decide to file in any court above small claims I recommend hiring litigation counsel to do so as the rules get more complicated in the higher courts than in small claims which are designed to be accessible to non-lawyers although this does not at all prohibit you from hiring counsel for small claims if desired.I hope this helps somewhat.

While the underlying objection sounds reasonable and legitimate to me, I agree that they should be able to provide you a citation to either the servicer's loan policy or a law as to why they cannot make the disclosure.  It is possible that the people you were speaking to were too low on the ### pole to understand what laws dictate what they can and cannot provide, and to whom.  Perhaps someone higher up, as you suggest, could confirm whether the ### employees are providing you correct information.I do not sense anything fishy" here but also believe that you have a right to be satisfied as to what legal or policy limitations are informing the answer you received from the lender.  Again I am not aware of any recent legislation (federal or state) on this but being the borrower under federal student loans I know that similar limitations would apply in my situation as to my mother or hypothetical spouse even if I gave permission for direct conversation between my ### and such persons.

While I am not familiar with any recent North Carolina statutes on this issue, I know that generally speaking, student loan servicers are not permitted to share private data relating to a borrower's student loans to unauthorized third parties, including spouses and close family members.  However, in case I have missed something in my monitoring of the North Carolina General Assembly, I include a link here that might be highly useful to you:###This link shows you every law that was recently passed during a regular or special session of the North Carolina General Assembly.  The laws that immediately appear are ones passed from the most recent session, and using the ### menu near the top of your screen, you can select prior sessions and then read the subject lines of the ### passed to see if they relate to your specific query or issue.

He has a crack cocaine addiction and also uses weed" and drinks alcohol.  He disappears for days at a time hanging out in the street mostly in ### NC.  I have asked him a number of times in the past ###.### (the deed/mortgage is in my name only) and he refuses to do so stating "I have nowhere to go" although he has family in ### and ### NC.  I tried about a year ago to get him evicted by going to the civil magistrate's office at the Cumberland County Courthouse.  I spent $### only to be informed that the civil magistrate's office only handles landlord/tenant evictions.  This is not a domestic violence protective order issue as he has not physically assaulted me or verbally threatened me with physical violence and is not a protective order issue as he is not ### me. So going through the SafeLink Program in this county would not be appropriate for my current situation. I cannot put up with this living situation any longer.  He is totally ### me and our relationship. He feels like he can come and go as he pleases living here and he associates with illegal ### people (drug dealers drug addicts and people who ### to support their drug habit).  He pays no bills in this home and won't apply for work as he couldn't pass a urine drug screen.  He also is involved in illegal activities to support his ### habits (misdemeanor larceny and he is out on bond for a felony habitual larceny charge currently).  So I need some advice on how I can legally get him to move his belongings out of my house which court since this is not a criminal issue and what paperwork I need to file.  A good friend told me that if he gets arrested and is locked up for at least ### or if he stays away from this house for a month and I don't know where he is it would be considered as "abandonment" of his property and I could remove his belongings as I see fit.  Is this true? I really would appreciate some assistance with finding out what I can do legally to get him out of my house.  It has gotten to the point that it is affecting me physically and psychologically.  I feel like I am being forced to allow him to continue living here just because this is his legal residence.  I have tried the eviction process which did not work out.  Thank you for any advice/assistance that your organization can provide. "43672.8840277778 Apartments where I reside were being renovated, the bathroom cabinet was put back in over a water pipe that was cracked. This caused water to rise under the bathroom tiles. I went to use bathroom one night and slipped and fell due to the water rising under the tiles. I reported to the sight manager however she never reported  the accident or filled out an accident form to  inform the Apartment Building Owners. Have my rights been violated some type?43673.0270833333 Good Saturday to you, Ms. ###:I hope that your summer has being going well, aside from the incident you mention in your question.  You ask a very good question that is worth further investigation and examination by a personal injury lawyer who handles premises liability and slip and fall cases.  While I cannot say for sure whether your apartment complex is liable, if you actually sustained a physical injury, you should definitely consult with a personal injury lawyer about a possible slip and fall case.  What would need to be proven are the following: (###) that the apartment complex owed you a duty of care; (###) that that duty was breached due to a negligent act; (###) that your physical or property damage injuries were proximately and factually caused by the negligent act; and (###) that you sustained damages to yourself or your property as a result.  You are more likely to recover monetary relief in the event that you had a physical injury, and this would need to be corroborated with medical records.  I strongly believe that you can prove Elements (###) and likely (###), but (###) and (###) is where you are likely to get the most resistance from the apartment complex if they dispute that they owe you anything.  The property is more likely to try to accommodate you if they are up against a reputable and diligent personal injury lawyer fighting on your behalf.Start with a consultation with a lawyer of your choice.  The lawyer might take the ### tactic of sending a demand letter for payment and settlement of your claim first, which could be followed up with a lawsuit if that is necessary.  I am not sure what approaches counsel would favor, but that will be more clear once you have consulted on the matter for either a half hour or full hour.Hopefully you will obtain the more specific clarity you need soon.  Keep in mind that in North Carolina, the statute of limitations for personal injury claims is three years, so if you decide to sue, it must be within that period.Best wishes to you on this important matter.  Have a blessed and productive remainder of the summer.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43673.7652777778 Hello, ###:I recommend using ### Find a Lawyer" search function and search for ### ### and Chapel ### lawyers who handle disability cases.

I just received your email and I wanted to just take a moment to say thank you so much for taking your time to respond and care enough to direct me to a place that might can help me . I am very hopeful but either way I can maybe find out more about the requirements and give me some type of hope for the future. I wish it was possible that if your crime was non violent and a certain category that once you completed your sentence or completed whatever the court had ordered that the crime come off of the criminal record. I never knew how judgemental people would be and this would always be a major factor in my life until I actually went threw not being able to get a job, an apartment or place to live without having to be completely embarrassed and finally wanting to just give up altogether because I don't see a way out and as each day passes the harder left gets!!

God Bless43713.21875 I had received my first felony conviction many years ago. I am not a bad person, a violent person, or done any hard" crimes but nevertheless I have had convictions that are a class ### catagory.  It has completely ruined my life to say the least. Not just by being so embarrassing having to choose lower income/ lower class jobs because my criminal record not being able to apply and get accepted for certain housing is also very hard  but most of all not being able to go to college and get any type of degree!! That is the hardest to let go of. I have always wanted to do something I have always worked and been independent but if I had just some things  anything taken off my record then I will feel more confident and I know without a doubt I will graduate college and have a degree that I've always wanted so much. Could you please explain the process to me? I don't have the type of money to afford a attorney to go and do this for me  that's one reason I want it done so I can get a good higher paying job. Any advice please? Thanks so much"43674.4354166667 Awesome answer - THANK YOU!!So much better than another attorneys answer for a diff. but similar question (how can I possibly sell or rent out this home with this situation going on") - this answer was lacking any detail and no research was done. Care to advise on that?Yours was perfect and I had planned on calling the police at ### tonight for a ### ###."43677.8125 Good afternoon,I am sorry to hear about your situation.  As someone who has experienced a similar problem in the past, I understand how frustrating it can be. I reviewed the ### Hills neighborhood covenants, publicly available on the ### Hills website.  Unfortunately, nothing in the covenants appears to prohibit or limit this type of noise nuisance, to the extent it is not a commercial vehicle.  I also reviewed the Winston-### Code with respect to noise violations.  The city code has very limited restrictions on residential noise, which are limited to garbage collection, garage machinery and power tools (Section ###-###), and which do not apply to your situation.  The Winston-### Code, however, does incorporate by reference the ### County noise ordinance (Chapter ###5, Section ###5-###).  The ### County noise ordinance includes much broader restrictions on loud and disturbing noise" and prohibit the "production or ### of noise amplified speech music or other sounds that disturb or frighten individuals and is detrimental to the health safety or welfare of any individual and the peace and dignity of the county".  The noise ordinance continues to expressly prohibit the "use of any automobile motorcycle or other vehicle so out of repair so loaded or in such manner as to create loud grating grinding rattling or other disturbing noise".  There is no further description provided as to what actions are covered by this prohibition and no specific decibel limitation on this type of noise - a large amount of discretion is left with the police and local officials as to what is loud and disturbing.  From your description it appears you have previously discussed the concerns with your neighbor.  I would recommend the following next steps:###.  Discuss with the ### Hills ### association. There may be a neighborhood rule against the loud vehicle that is not publicly available for review. Even if there is not the associations may have additional suggestions regarding possible relief.###.  Contact the Winston-### Police Department (non-emergency - ###TERM0013###-###0) and/or the ### County Sheriffâ€™s Department (non-emergency - ###TERM0013###-###). I suggest calling during the daytime and explaining the situation to an officer. If they agree this could potentially be a violation ask them to send an officer around at the time the car is normally started.  ###.  If you are unable to win any relief through the above steps you can pursue either a small claims court claim or a civil lawsuit for the disturbance.  In North Carolina the Small Claims Court is for limited (less than $###0000) non-criminal claims where you pursue relief with or without a lawyer.  The ### County website provides links to some of the forms necessary to pursue a small claims case (https://www.###countyclerk.com/small-claims-forms/). One potential claim could be for reimbursement for the expenses you have incurred such as the windows and ###.  The forms available on the website are designed for more specific claims such as non-payment of a debt or ejection of a tenant or trespasser. I would suggest contacting a local real estate lawyer in the Winston-### area for assistance in preparation of the paperwork.  Such lawyer could also advise as to the feasibility of pursuing a civil lawsuit with respect to the noise problems. The smalls claim court is located at the ### County Government Center (###-###).It is important to remember that with a smalls claim case or a civil lawsuit you will need to provide evidence of the noise and the context of it (time duration loudness).  You will also need to show how much this noise has disrupted your life and your prior attempts to remedy the situation (including conversations with your neighbor and your expenses such as the windows).    One additional item that should be noted: if the excessive noise is not just from the normal operation of the SUV but from a modified muffler (or lack of one) there is a North Carolina statute covering excessive noise from ### or exhaust systems (N.C. General Statute ###0-######8).  I cannot find examples of this being enforced and like the local noise ordinances it is a matter of discretion for the local enforcement officers.  If you think the SUV is made louder by these type of ### enhancements you should mention this when you speak with the local enforcement officers or in the small claims process.  Thank you.

Thanks for any advice you can offer!### ### ######-###"43675.7604166667 Mr. ###:I hope you had a good summer, and am looking forward to fall in ### County.  I just saw this message in the queue of questions on NC Free Legal Answers, and it appears that no one has yet responded to your question.  While this question dates a couple months back, the legal points to be made here are the same, and have the same power and effect: what you just described here is both blackmail (a misde###or under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###), and extortion (a felony under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###.4).  It is one thing to demand payment for a debt that is owed directly to oneself, and another to do so for tax debt that indirectly affects someone, but is not owed, and also to do so with threats to accuse the victim of crimes s/he did not commit, or to threaten defamation just for the sake of getting paid.  If everything you just said is true and can be proven, serious crimes have been committed, and should be reported to local law enforcement for investigation.If your ex-wife lives in a jurisdiction other than North Carolina, you should report the crimes both here and in the jurisdiction where your wife lives.  The authorities in the appropriate states will exercise discretion as to how to move forward with criminal investigation and charges.  If charges are brought, it is possible that the judge might order restitution in the form of payments improperly received by your wife due to her intimidating you into making them.I hope this helps.  God bless you as you work through this challenge, which I am sure you will eventually overcome.Best,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43729.7347222222 Generally speaking, if the damage to a vehicle exceeds a certain percentage of the current value (I believe it is 75% in NC). In that case, the car insurance can just pay you the value of the car less any deductible. You may negotiate with the insurance company to try to keep your car and receive a payment and then you can fix it on your own, but in that event you may have to have a salvage title. Unfortunately, the law is that when someone damages another person's property only the actual cash value of the damage is payable.This article might also provide some help: ###43690.7472222222 My car was hit in the rear while I was at a traffic light.

I then went about making direct communication with the homeowner of the threatening communication, to inform of non-payment and my intent to file a lien if not paid by a certain date.  The homeowner began ### the issue, to which I found the contractor/### had already allegedly performed corrective actions of my installed product.  I've also received a cease and desist email to no longer communicate with the homeowner directly or indirectly.

By not allowing me to take corrective actions with my work, would that constitute acceptance of work, and release from any future liability as they are now, potentially, adversely affecting my original work?

It sounds like you have paid the contractor about $16,### $###,###.  You may very well be able to find an attorney in ### County who would take your case on contingency, which means that they will take a percentage of any recovery they collect from suing the contractor.  There are potentially elements of fraud involved that could increase the damages if in fact the contractor encouraged you to hire him on the basis that he was licensed, but in the end you prove that he lied about that.  If you cannot find an attorney to take the case on a contingency basis, you can file a small claims action yourself to recover up to $5000.  While it would be unfortunate that you could not get back all of your money, that would at least allow you get some of it back.  I have attached a link to a helpful guide to filing your own small claims action:  ###.I hope this information was helpful and I wish you good luck!43704.7277777778 we went into an agreement with ### ### of On Site Construction we were lead to believe he was insured and licensed he is neither.

I agree with the Clerk of Court in your county that if you file in small claims, you need to file where the owner/landlord actually resides; otherwise, in North Carolina, your suit will be automatically dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  If the landlord truly lives in Texas, the specific relevant Texas county would be the only proper place in which to sue in small claims.  One possible way around this is to sue the landlord in ### County District Court, which has broader jurisdiction than small claims court, and in which you could likely establish personal jurisdiction based on the landlord's property and business contacts, AS LONG AS you could show proof of proper, personal service upon the defendant in Texas, whether by certified mail, process server or local sheriff's deputy (see North Carolina Rule of Procedure ###).  I would consult in person with a local civil litigator if you wish to pursue this.District Court would allow you to get around the small claims jurisdictional question.  Now the question is whether your likely damage amount justifies the cost, expense and time it will take to pursue this at this higher level in North Carolina.  Reach out to local counsel in your ### for more precise discussion.Best wishes to you,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43689.9770833333 My neighbors rent a home from a landlord that supposedly lives in Texas, six weeks ago during a bad storm their shed blew a part and into our truck that was in my driveway. We've gotten an estimate to fix it and have given it and our phone numbers to the tenants to give to the landlord since they refuse to give us the landlords contact information. The tenants said they have forwarded to them, we haven't heard anything at all. I doubt they have homeowners insurance and we only have liability on the truck due to it not being driven much. The landlord still gets her mail including tax papers on the house at their rental property, she left no forwarding address at all. Searches online have yielded nothing. Can I file the small claims suit in NC since it involved the property that they own here or do I have to file in Texas? My clerk of court said that I have to drive to Texas to file there since she lives there". I just want my truck fixed "43679.7833333333 It depends on the basis and evidence supporting your claim. Real property would be governed by who was on the deed for the house and the terms of your father's will. Without knowing the basis of your claim, it is difficult to tell what to do. You should also be cognizant of the passage of time, as some claims are bared by the passage of time. An attorney may consider you case on a contingency basis, but would need to see the deed and estate documents and evidence of your claim.43704.7222222222 My dad built a family house at the beach in early ###. It was suppose to be for his kids, but his sister took it over turned it into a bed and breakfast, well she just sold it... idk how she obtained rights to it bc I was just a kid, my older brother has nothing to do with her bc of the fact... she just sold the house for $###.  I honestly think my brother and I deserve that money what can I do bc entire family knows she stole house from him before he died in 1997. 43679.8506944444 The good news is that you have $100K in liability coverage.  If your insurance company offers to pay up to that amount and the injured party accepts it, that will be the end of the matter and you will have nothing to worry about.  If your insurance company refuses to pay the claim, and you get sued, the insurance company will provide you with an attorney.  That is included in your insurance policy.  That attorney can then advise you on your specific questions regarding the beach house.  Just stay in touch with the insurance adjuster assigned to your claim and can update you on the claim status.  43704.6729166667 my husband brought me home from heart failure surgery.

Thank you!43681.9701388889 Hi ###,It sounds like your son is not a tenant, but a guest.  For him to be a tenant-at-will" he would have needed to pay rent at some point.  Although he has helped with groceries on occasion that likely does not rise to the level of the type of contribution he'd need to make to be considered a tenant.The eviction process in NC is intended for tenants not guests and gives tenants certain rights in the eviction process.  There is no similar ### process for guests in NC and they don't have the same rights as tenants.However if a guest refuses to leave you can go through the police or even get a trespass warrant issued by a judge in order to get the guest to leave.

By raising defenses you put the ball in their court to prove that they are entitled to enforce.Your securities law question is a little outside my ###, but let me think on it.For now, I advise you just get your answer filed.43690.9083333333 Double Space your answer and I think you will be fine.Add one more thing in the requests for relief.  Add a new paragraph ###:###. Staying enforcement of the claimed Judgment until this matter is resolved.Then I think you're good to go.  Good luck!43691.7215277778 Happy to look at your next draft.43691.6756944444 I did receive them. Thanks. This program is not designed to result in representing you in court. But it is here for you to ask questions and receive answers. I think your answer is a good start.I don't think, however, that a counterclaim will work. You just need to keep them from transferring the judgment to NC and enforcing it.43690.8513888889 I need assistance in preparing the Answer to a civil summons. This civil summons appears to be a request for a California judgment to be transferred to NC.  I have no knowledge of the original judgment. I was not served and the defendant on the original judgment was ### Logistics Group. Item ### (name and last known address) ### ### ### ### ###. I have never lived in California and I believe that address to be an office address for ### Logistics / ### ###. My attorney in Florida is very familiar with this matter. He is not licensed in NC so he can not represent me. He suggested that I have a legal aid attorney call him. He will be able to save a lot of time and research. He believes this matter should be handled with a Motion to Dismiss the entire matter, including the first judgment I know nothing about and does not show on my credit reports. My Florida attorney can confirm that I was professionally, financially, and mentally destroyed when we sold and closed our Fort ### corporate offices. I am on SSI disability, Medicaid and receive food stamps. I am disabled and can not handle the level of stress associated with this. I don't own a car; a friend lets me drive her old car. I am in desperate need of assistance and I can not afford an attorney. When you take my case we can schedule a call to my Florida attorney. Thank you,### ### #########-###43685.7576388889 I thought the counterclaim would be a stretch and something I could not do representing myself. One other note of interest, I have never sold any stock issued to me; either ### or ### Logistics Group after we changed our name. Most of that stock was issued to me because I always took a very modest salary (just enough to get by) and salary from prior years accrued and was transferred into stock as advised by our corporate attorney, accountant and SEC auditing accounting firm. When we merged and closed our existing operation I had a considerable amount of shares that became unrestricted within a year of my resignation. My resignation was planned in the original merger agreement since they were not in the same line of business as we were and operations ran from ### with their US staff working from California. Their stock is currently no longer trading. They did not comply with SEC reporting requirements and were removed from the ### stock symbol ###. I had value there that diminished to nothing after ### began running the company. In a normal Answer to a Complaint I would need to file my request for Discovery before they ### I do so in this case? If so what is the NC form and procedures for that? I completely understand you can't represent me but with the guidance you supply helps tremendously in my attempt to represent myself.43690.8680555556 I was the President and CEO of ###, Inc (small consumer electronics public company) and we sold out through a reverse stock merger with TERM0###352 ###'s Chinese company (a freight company) to create ### Logistics Group. I served as an officer of that company for the purpose of closing down our ### corporate office in Fort ###. TERM0###352 ### and other reps of his were also officers of ### Logistics Group. TERM0###352 ### and ### ### (shareholder) worked behind my back to complete what they needed to ensure they made money from the merger. I made ###actually lost everything due to my dealings with them. I went through a complete mental breakdown and ###. I did not know anything about the prior foreign (California) judgments as I was not served. the service address used for me was an office associated with TERM0###352 ### in California. I have never lived in CA or conducted business there. I am disabled (physical issues and mental health issues) and receive only SSI Disability, ### EBT services and am on Medicaid. I can not afford an attorney. I did work with Legal Aid of NC but they could not take my case due to lack of attorneys for the current demand. The attorney there did give me as much guidance as she could which was helpful. I have completed my Answer to Summons myself. I must file by ###/###. I have to clear this hurdle as I am not sleeping and am having to have emergency meeting with my psychiatrist. The person that TERM0###352 ### really has a problem with is ### ### who is currently in prison for stock manipulation and wire fraud related to a company he worked with after the merger of ### and ### Logistics Group. ### and ### made side deals for stock and stock warrants without consulting me. Should I send a copy of my Answer to Summons as I have it now for your review and comment? Thank you,V ### ######43690.7916666667 I will keep the question open so you can reach out.43691.7381944444 I will look into the details of what you just sent me and add that to my answer I will complete this quickly and get it back to you tonight for your review tomorrow. I wish there was an option for me to get an attorney but I keep running into dead ends. I have even try to see if some local attorneys will work pro bono and have not been able to find anything.In general do you think that is a good answer to be completed by the defendant? and does the judge ever take into consideration that the defendant cannot afford an attorney and has not been able to find legal assistance? much of the reason I cannot afford an attorney is because of what happened to me in ###. ###... I lost everything from my professional reputation to my house and my carAlso would it be advantageous for me to counterclaim for mental anguish as this has definitely created major issues for me?Did you finally receive all the documents I sent you?43690.8486111111 I would be happy to look at it. The document you attached to the last response also did not come through.43690.7986111111 I'll look this over tonight and see if I can make some edits for you. 43690.9548611111 Is there any way to ask the CA court to dismiss the judgment? 43715.13125 Just keeping this open. 43700.7597222222 Just to ###; I file my answer with the Civil office in the ### County Courthouse then send only one copy to ### ### attorney? I am only required to send via regular mail? then do not file for discovery and I wait to hear back from the Court? I have a feeling that when they realize I have answered with a decent defense they may not go forward. Even if they do I have extremely limited resources and my SSI $### can not be garnished. My house that I inherited from my father is still in his name as I am paying off the home equity line of credit against it. That will take about ###. 43691.7326388889 Okay, perfect.I am already adjusting my Answer with the suggestions. Should the reference to the laws be in the AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES section or in the WHEREFORE, Defendant prays that the Court section? or both?I will send draft back to you when complete. How long are you available tonight or will this be something you see in the morning?43690.9138888889 Take & COUNTERCLAIMS" out and just call it an Answer.I would remove the header "AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES" and just go with numbered paragraphs.I would change paragraph ###:###. Defendant ### ### notes that he is not shown as a Defendant on the face of the Judgment Plaintiff seeks to transfer and that the only Defendant listed is ### Logistics Group Inc.Change paragraph ###:5. Defendant was never properly served with the original complaint dated ### in the California action or with any documentation related to the California action including the judgment. The California Court lacked personal jurisdiction over Defendant and Defendant never had the opportunity to contest that jurisdiction because he was never served with process.IN paragraph ###### (c) after (subsection 6) include this "including without limitation that the California Court lacked personal jurisdiction to enter the judgment and Defendant never had notice or an opportunity to be heard in the California Court."(Please only make those two changes if it is true that you never had notice of the case being filed against you in California - if you knew about it but did not make an appearance in the case let me know.)Delete Counterclaims and just have your last paragraph state that "Defendant asserts all applicable affirmative defenses including without limitation any defenses set forth above as well as defenses based upon the equitable doctrines of laches and unclean hands as well as any applicable statute of limitations or repose. Defendant further reserves the right to assert any other defenses or counterclaims should any basis for such claims become known during the course of this matter."laches means they waited too long to assert their rights - in other words they slept on their rights and now should not in fairness be allowed to assert them.unclean hands means that they should not be allowed to proceed because of the ### or inequitable conduct they followed to get here. That would fit with things like "serving" you at an another Defendant's address etc.  It's a fairness argument.after your WHEREFORE you should start your paragraph numbering again. I'd do this:WHEREFORE Defendant prays the Court to issue an Order for the following relief:(###) Dismissing Plaintiff's case with prejudice.(###) Denying transfer entry or enforcement in North Carolina of the foreign judgment set forth in the Complaint.(###) Granting costs if any to the Defendant.(###) Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.Respectfully requested this ### day of ######9.### ###Pro SeThen your address and phone number and an email address."43691.6756944444 Thank you for asking this question. I would be happy to assist you. I need to ask a few questions.First, the first of your two linked documents did not come through, can you send that again? The attorney's cover letter is there, but not the summons or the judgment itself.Second, did you have any connection with the Plaintiff at all? Did you ever owe them money in any way? What dealings, if any, did you have with ### Logistics Group?It may be that you need a referral to an attorney in your community, but I may be able to point you in the right direction with additional information.Thanks.43690.7319444444 Thank you, I will update you soon. 43701.8090277778 Thank you. I have not heard back from ### ### attorney yet. I'm hoping I will not. I'm not sure how or if I can follow up on the case with the ### County Superior Court. 43714.7784722222 That's a good start. Your main problem is going to be that the judgment has existed in California since ###. It is good that you have informed the court that you were never served with the original complaint or the original judgment. State clearly that the address used was never associated with you.You will need to state you ask that the transfer of judgment be denied because you are entitled to relief from the judgment under Rule 60(b) ### ###. That is the Rule that allows for relief from a judgment. You can find it here: ###You are going to want to say that you are entitled to relief under Rule ### (subsection 4), it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application (subsection 5), and that there are other grounds justifying relief from the judgment (subsection 6).Once you say that, you say that your answer should be considered a notice of defenses under N.C. Gen. Stat. section 1C-### 1C-1703(c) [that means it shouldn't be enforced against you in the meantime], that the Plaintiff should be required to prove why the judgment should be entitled to full faith and credit, and that enforcement of the foreign judgment should be denied.You file that along with a certificate of service and serve it on the lawyer. Happy to look it over before you file it, but you need to file it by Friday. You would be better off with an attorney to appear on your behalf. Should they allow the judgment to be transferred, you should consider speaking to a Bankruptcy Attorney in order to get this thing off your back.43690.8395833333 Up to them to proceed from here. Remember, they still have a judgment against you where they originally got it. This just means they have to prove some stuff before they can move it to NC and enforce it here.Good luck!43714.7798611111 You don't file for discovery. Discovery is questions and requests for documents that you send to the other side under the Rules of Civil Procedure that they have to answer truthfully. I think your ### may be correct. Take three copies to the Clerk of Court and file them. THe Clerk keeps one. You get the other two. Mail one of those by regular mail to their lawyer.Good luck43691.7347222222 You will never know how much I appreciate your guidance.

Thank you!"43687.6125 Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I direct you to the specific language of N.C.G.S. Â§ ###, which requires you to mail" the invoices and unused deposits within ###; you did this when you attempted in good faith to notice your former tenants by mail.  You are still in compliance with the statute based on the facts you mentioned here but need to re-mail or personally deliver (depending on which is more effective and feasible) the notice as soon as possible because even when there is an "interim" accounting the ### limit of time in which the landlord has to finally and definitely account for all activity relating to the tenant's deposit (including a refund if that applies) is ###.  In normal situations the landlord accounts for invoices deductions and refunds within ### but the statute recognizes situations in which that might not always be possible.  The landlord must always mail the notices in the first ### but must absolutely resolve any remaining issues pertaining to the tenant's account by the end of ###.This should not be confused with an interpretation that the landlord can simply wait ###; the ### period is designed only for landlords who despite best efforts and due diligence to mail invoices and deposits within the initial ### still could not "close" business with the tenant during that time.  When that happens an interi###counting should be provided for the first 30-day window with all business settled by the end of the second 30-day window (i.e. for a total of ###).Here is a link to the statutory provisions of the Tenant Security Deposit Act: ###.  Section Â§ 42-### but browse the Act generally using this link to make sure you have not forgotten anything relevant.

Within a short time I got ### ###.43688.9034722222 ###,Responsibility for the lost images.  In order to give you a better answer to this question I would need to review your initial contract with Ms. ###.  If you are able to send that via message, can you do so?  Many photographer ### contracts state that the person being ###, not the photographer, has ownership of the images.  If that is the case here, then you would be responsible for losing something that she owns.  Ms. ### is certainly warranted in her concerns that the images that she technically owns have been lost and could fall into the wrong hands.Regardless, it sounds like you likely breached your initial contract with Ms. ### because you did not deliver the types of images she expected to see.  I understand that you delivered a good number of images, but these were not all of the type that she expected to receive under your contract.  If Ms. ### took legal action, you could potentially owe her a full refund plus any other damages (including possibly emotional damages).New Contract.  Regarding the ### contract the answer here is really a business decision on your end.  Do you want to make these folks as happy as possible so that they will not leave you bad reviews or sue you for the entire amount?  I can't imagine how devastated they must feel (and I am sure you feel devastated as well).  It sounds like they are asking for a partial refund as well as some future assurance that you will take responsibility for lost images.  In exchange if you feel it is warranted from a business perspective you could ask that they promise not to sue you under the initial contract and ask that some kind of time limit (say ###) be placed on your responsibility for the lost images.  You may risk making them more angry and moving forward with a lawsuit so this is a business decision that you'll have to make.-###"43726.8409722222 Earlier this year, ### paid me to photograph her wedding.

The last statement she wanted in the contract was concerning the device itself.

She is assuming I have ### images of her getting dressed on that card, which she asked me to photograph. But in truth, she doesnâ€™t know what exactly is on that card because she did not physically see it with her own eyes. The chances of these images being â€œleakedâ€ are slim to none. I do not feel I should sign something like this because to me it seems very binding. They will possibly slander my name, and at this point I donâ€™t care because I want this to be over with. The contract so far states the situation and our current agreement on the monetary refund. I have also agreed to produce those images for her if the device is ever found, regardless of the time frame. Every phone conversation has been recorded thus far.Am I responsible?

I am trying to sell my restaurant to a separate third party individual but the defendant is wrongfully claiming ownership of my belongings that were on the property, including equipment, personal items, and two sheds (one of which was removed by the defendant without my consent), making it difficult to finalize the sale of my business to the third party because those items were part of the sale.

If you want to sue for more than that, you will need to file a complaint in district court. If you file in district court, I would recommend you engage an attorney because the rules of procedure are more strictly enforced in district court vs. small claims court. You should be able to handle your own case in small claims court, but you will still need to prove you own the property and that the defendant took it. You will also need to prove the value.

This is situation in which there are not really clear-cut answers, but rather judgment calls that you must make as a matter of discretion.  For one, I doubt that the store will bring a small claims lawsuit against you if you do not pay the $###, since filing fees alone for small claims is $###, and the service of process fee is $###, bringing the store's initial ### to no less than $###.  Whether you decide to pay anything further, above and beyond the $40.###.  My moral advice to you is to do your best to figure out what you actually owe the store, then pay the manager that with a written letter explaining your justification for the payment, as well as your lack of criminal intent as to the receipts.  This shows that you acted in good faith toward the store to restore it whole once you realized that something of monetary value left the store inappropriately, and it lessens the chance that criminal consequences will come to you, as long as you act preemptively.This would not guarantee that no small claims (civil) lawsuit or criminal charges will be occur, but only that your acting ### and in good faith, ahead of time, will bolster your credibility should your actions ever be questioned in the ### in a civil, criminal or subsequent employment context.  You cannot control what the store does going forward, but you can do whatever you can on the front end to ### any version of events that paints you in a negative light.  Pay the store what you truly owe it to the best of your knowledge of what these receipts are worth, and explain your good intentions in writing (with copies saved of what you wrote).  I hope that the store will then be reasonable about this and not blow this up into something beyond what it should be.I wish you much success as you navigate this, and also as you work towards your next employment opportunity, which I hope will be better than the previous one by far.

In ###, we had bounce back coupons that printed out after most customers transactions that some wanted and others didnâ€™t. Over the course of ###, apparently two made it home with me though it was not intentional. About a month later, I was cleaning, and found the coupons. I ### it over for a minute and decided that the POS would catch if the customer had requested a new coupon or if this one was never used as it does for every other coupon.  Apparently the computer did not catch the coupon and let me use it. About ###-###, I was fired over the use of these coupons. I tried to pay back the company then and there because it was never my intention to take what wasnâ€™t mine, but I was told that NC Recovery would handle it and signed a promissory note ( I do not remember the details, I am trying to get a copy). I thought I would pay back the $###. They are â€œdemandingâ€ that I pay $###, when I no longer have any income. I do not understand why this number is so high, and why it is more than what I used and wanted to pay back on the spot when I had learned what happened. I do not know if I should get a lawyer, or if I should just pay the penalty? I also do not know if they will eventually bring criminal charges against me.

Please call?43693.0034722222 Hello, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  In a situation where there is a written lease, the terms of that document govern what options are available to both landlord and tenant when a tenant wishes to leave before the natural expiration of the lease.  Normally, in a ### lease, there is a provision about buyout" fees or early termination fees which would be paid to the landlord in exchange for the landlord's discharge of the tenant fro###y future legal obligations under the lease.  Your option would be to pay such penalties or attempt to negotiate a written modification supported by consideration that both sides could sign.  Note that the landlord is allowed but is not legally obligated to negotiate a modified agreement with you.  This is purely voluntary on the landlord's part.You can always leave early but just be aware that you might have to pay penalties under the lease should you elect to do so.  Unfortunately once both landlord and tenant actually sign a lease that document does govern what happens afterward until the lease is either modified expired or terminated by judicial order.  This can sometimes leave the tenant in a rather rigid situation if life changes for him/her and the landlord is less than understanding about the tenant's need to change course.  Sad but true at times.I hope that whatever happens in subsequent conversations with the landlord that you will land well on your feet with your ability to care for yourself and maintain being ###.

Is this possible?43694.6569444444 Thank you for your question.  If Iâ€™m understanding your question correctly, you have a 50c order in place regarding you and you would like to participate in a mediation to discuss the matter with the court and to have your position considered.  You might consider going to the Clerk of Courtâ€™s office in your county and ask to speak with the staff member who handles 50c orders.  They can explain to you how to ask the court for a mediation or other way that you can express yourself to the court.  How that is accomplished may vary depending on how long the order has been in place.  But the staff in the clerkâ€™s office can explain the procedures and documentation they use for what you would like to do.  I hope this helps.

I am sorry for what you have gone through with the car situation.  I believe you need to show the recall paperwork and the paperwork regarding the sale of the car to you.

Lawyers are not allowed to directly solicit your business, so you will need to contact them first when you are ready to discuss moving forward with this matter.  You can use ### Find a Lawyer" feature to search for family law counsel in your corner of eastern North Carolina.  Also potentially helpful is the North Carolina Bar Association's referral network and any local bar associations in Onslow County or nearby where you can inquire about referrals.Finally you might also consider contacting the North Carolina Central University School of Law Family Law Clinic in ###.

I was told by the Sheriff's office that if I could find another address for the company and/or owner, I could pay an additional fee to try to have him served at the new address but I cannot afford to and cannot locate another address. The only other address that I know is for a P.O. Box. It took me a few months to even save enough money to even have him served the first time.

If the hearing date has not yet happened, be prepared to immediately notify the magistrate upon his/her issuance of the judgment that you intend to appeal, and the magistrate can direct you as to what you need to file that day.  Otherwise, if the hearing is already over and the entry of judgment has been entered, you of course have ten (10) days to appeal, and you should stop by the Wake County Clerk of Superior Court's office and tell them that you wish to file an appeal.  The Clerk will have the necessary forms and will verify with you that you have done them correctly before accepting them.  Normally when I visit the Clerk's office in Wake and ### Counties, the staff there is very helpful.

It sounds like a very bad situation with the gum in the food and then made even worse by the response of the employees at ###.  In cases involving foreign objects (such as gum) in food, typically the claims in which there may be a recognizable damage are those in which the injured party bites into the object and there is damage to the personâ€™s ###.  It sounds like, fortunately, your daughter did not bite into the gum.   I am not telling you there is not a claim, merely that usually with foreign objects cases, the recovery may be limited without actual physical injury.  If you are interested in pursuing a potential case involving the gum, or a slander or defamation lawsuit, I encourage you to contact the North Carolina Lawyerâ€™s Referral Service at 1-800-###.

Two weeks ago i went back to have stitches taken out. The nurse said I think i got all of them. Last week the ### strips fell off. There are still stitches in my hand and it may be becoming infected. Is there anything that can be done43703.7375 Thank you for your question.  I am very sorry for what you have going on with your hand and the stitches.  The most important thing to be done is to make sure you continue to follow up with appropriate medical care concerning your condition.  If after your medical care is concluded, you have concerns about the medical care that you received, you may ask an attorney to assist you in investigating a potential medical malpractice claim.  But while the medical event is going on, it is best to focus on making sure you seek the medical care that you feel you need.  Under North Carolina law, there is liability for damages if a medical provider commits negligence that causes injury to a patient.  I hope that you do not suffer injury as a result of this medical care.  But if you have concerns, you should consult with an attorney with experience in medical malpractice cases.  If you have difficulty finding an attorney, you can contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association.  You can find information about them on the NCBA website.  Good luck to you.43704.6805555556 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and I hope this summer has been a happy one for you.  Your question has two legal aspects, at minimum: first, the issue pertaining to the verbal option to lease to own, which was rescinded; and second, the issue of your tenant's rights ### the property is sold to a subsequent owner.  Let's briefly discuss each issue in turn.First, an exclusive option to purchase or lease to own must be in writing, and supported by financial or other consideration in order to be legally effective against the owner who promised the ### buyer that s/he can purchase or lease to own the property.  Otherwise, the old common law rule ### an offer made may be rescinded at any time prior to formal acceptance (such as a signed contract), if verbally made, and if no definite time period for the exclusive option was stipulated.  A good example of a legally binding option in your situation would have been a written agreement under which you paid a certain sum of money (above and beyond what you normally pay in rental installments) in exchange for the owner not being able, during that time, to make any offers to any other person (often the time for the exclusive option is three to six months).  In the absence of such ###, it is my legal opinion that the verbal offer cannot be enforced by you against the ###.Second, ### a buyer has gained title to the property, your tenant's rights under the lease continue until either (###) your lease expires, (###) you are evicted due to a breach of your lease (or some other lawful reason under N.C.G.S. Chapter 4###, such as illegal activity on the premises), or (###) you and the new owner negotiate a written agreement, supported by a mutual exchange of consideration, that expressly supersedes the current lease.  Otherwise, you may continue to live in the home as long as you honor your lease.  The new owner would become your landlord, and you would pay rent to such person (or a property manager hired by him/her), and the same would be responsible for any security deposit refunds that may be applicable in your situation.(NOTE: One exception to what I wrote in the paragraph immediately above applies when there is a foreclosure.  Federal law mandates that a buyer of a rental home in foreclosure cannot disturb a pre-existing lease agreement UNLESS the buyer intends to live in the home.  If that is so, the foreclosure buyer must provide ###' notice to the tenant, regardless of whether the lease is for a set period of time, or is periodic in nature.  Based on what you wrote in your posting, this exception does not appear to be relevant in your situation, but I mention it for your information just the same.)I hope this is informative and helpful in some way.  If you ever have any difficulties with either the present or subsequent owner about the continued validity of your lease, please contact a local landlord-tenant lawyer, who can consult with you on a more detailed basis, and provide a letter of ### to the owner ### needed.  Hopefully, whatever transitions might ensue will be smooth for all concerned.I hope you have a very blessed fall season.  Best wishes to you in everything.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43704.0513888889 I'm renting a house. The landlord informed me last week that she is in a financial bin and wants to rent to own the house or sell it. She gave me option to rent to own for so much down. Then someone offered her more down now she is telling me she is going with the other person. This was all verbal. She is going tomorrow to sign a contract with them. My rent is not behind and is paid until the end of the month. How long before i have to move? Can she just kick me out? I'm in NC43703.7479166667 I was never served on a civil judgement case where my ex husband sued me based on a house I let go in foreclosure, there was no gain by me or loss by him, but he still claims this was his loss and I was never served and had no chance to defend myself. There is a civil law that says you have to have a loss in order to sue someone I need that law so I can try to apply it to my case. I don't have any money I am a nurse and somehow he got a $300,###. I have no way to hire an attorney and I don't have any assets, but the attorney continually harasses me and I live in WV now. He wants me to come back to NC for court several times a year.  I can't find anyone to help me and they told me to go to legal aid, which does not handle this sort of thing.43703.8159722222 Ms. Messing,Unfortunately, the process to set aside a judgment that has been entered by a judge really does require an attorney to work through that process.  I can only recommend you hire an attorney in Union County to file the appropriate motion to â€œset aside the judgment.â€  There may very well a problem with doing that if more than one year has passed.I am sorry there is not an easy answer, but I wish you the best of luck.43704.73125 My tenants want to own two pitbull puppies. As puppies they obviously have no prior aggressive behavioral history. They want to sign a contract stating they have renters insurance that covers pitbulls and would be solely responsible for any damages or injuries to others. Would I still potentially be held liable if they damage something or injure someone, even with the contract? 43703.8472222222 Yes, you could still be held responsible.  I would recommend telling them they canâ€™t have pitbulls in your home since they are a dangerous breed.  Since you are aware of their presence in the home that you own, then you can potentially be held liable if they attack someone.43704.6805555556 Ms. ###:Thank you for posting in this forum.  I did not see your original question, but I got enough of the ### of this situation from this second posting to understand what might be helpful.  I can think of two possibilities, both of which can be pursued concurrently with the other: (###) meeting officers in person at a local substation to provide details for a criminal investigation, and (###) filing for a civil protection order in ### County District Court.  I would try these two options and see how far you can go.  The process for filing for protection order is designed to benefit people who are not represented by legal counsel.  If you arrive at the ### County Justice Center and ask to file for a protection order, the Clerk's office or one of the deputy sheriffs just inside the door can direct you to the proper office and floor.  As for the ### Police, I would go to the substation closest to your residence.  You can visit the police department website and find out which substation precinct applies to your local part of ###.Also contact the ### Family Law Clinic if you need help with the civil protection filing process.  http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/file-it-yourself/  This link will take you directly to the ### website.I hope this helps, and that you can soon add some peace of mind to your family's daily living situation.  God bless you and keep you and all those you love safe.Best wishes to you this fall,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43707.1895833333 these are a few examples of what I am asking the above question for...######- My daughter and I left her school ### ### and went into the Village on My Way out from the Village I looked up and spotted ###â€™s ### with the Maine Tags in the front , but it was not her driving it was her husband. who is the owner of a ### ### (plates ###-###). I decided it was not good to come straight home, because I knew he would have some issues that day, as I noted before we recognized a pattern for him, as he progressed and it usually involved not having some type of â€œaccess to ###â€ good bad or indifferent. When we did arrive home, he was cutting grass in the front yard, and immediately turned off the lawn mower, ran inside and put on a black shirt (he usually cuts the grass with no shirt on), and made sure that I could see his â€œGunâ€, trouble with that was my ###. I distracted her and she never saw the Gun. I made sure that I took her in the house gave her some food and told her that we would go the the library , do her homework and proceed to come home when her father was here.On ###- Mr ### J. ### is doing something with lawn mower, he sees us parking in front and commences to take out the Gun, again I shielded my daughter, ###, slight laugh and said, you're gonna need to stop pulling this gun out around me and my daughter or use it ### turned red and just stomped awayâ€¦. This man is always on our property , but we make sure to stay away from hisOn October the 7###- ### and I came home around ###:###, with a shirt on now(this is to let the U.S. know he has his gun on him)... he was ready this day because he had it blatantly towards she and I , but if you were on the hill or anywhere else you could not see ### daughter walked around the car and even spoke to himâ€¦ I saw her jump but she spoke to him anywayâ€¦ I looked at him as he was flapping his left hand, towards her, and at that point stuck the key in the lock and began to explain to her about guns and that people had the right to own them, and do not be afraid of themâ€¦ I told her that most people that had them would not walk towards their neighbor with a gun out, and if they did they would have â€œshot you by now so pay that no attentionâ€. 43704.7590277778 I am a registered sex offender and today i was told by ### County Sheriff that being on Facebook constitutes a felony violation and I am subject to being charged with a felony.I thought the US Supreme Court overturned ### laws banning sex offenders from social media. The officer said that it is Facebook's policy that sex offenders cannot be on the site. Is it the duty for the ### county Sheriff to enforce the policies of Facebook or any other social media site??43704.88125 In the case of ### v. North Carolina, ###.Ct. ###, ###.### ###, the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a statute prohibiting registered sex offenders from â€œaccess[ing] a commercial social networking Web site where the sex offender knows that the site permits minor children to become membersâ€ or from â€œcreat[ing] or maintain[ing] personal Web pagesâ€ on such sites. ###. Ct. at ### (quoting N.C. ###. Stat. Ann. Â§ 1###-202.5(a), (e)).  In ruling that the law violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the United States Supreme Court held that the statute burdened substantially more speech than necessary to further the ### interests in protecting minors from sexual abuse.  Therefore, NC ### Stat 1###-202.###. However, in reviewing Facebook's policy on registered sex offenders, it appears that convicted sex offenders are not allowed to use Facebook. See https://www.facebook.com/help/###737?helpref=uf_permalink.  The Facebook policy encourages users to report convicted sex offenders who are also using Facebook.  The same may apply to other social media sites, but that would need to be independently verified.The sheriff is ###erally the chief law enforcement officer of the county, and, as a ###eral rule, sheriffs, within the scope of their respective jurisdictions, are given power, and have the duty, to preserve the peace and public order, enforce the criminal laws, prevent and detect crime, provide security for courts, serve criminal warrants and other writs and summonses, and transport prisoners. See http://ncsheriffs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The_Office_of_Sheriff_in_North_Carolina-Sept15201###.pdf.  See page ### (citing ###. Jur. Sherriffs 30 (###)).While one can argue that a sheriff's decision to report a sex offender to Facebook is beyond the scope of his or her traditional duties, one can also argue that such reporting is done to preserve the peace and public order" or to "prevent and detect crime." In short arguments can be made for and against a Sherriff reporting a convicted sex offender to Facebook or other social media sites. In this case so long as the Sherriff is not trying to enforce a law that has been held to be unconstitutional it is likely that his or her decision to report your activity on Facebook would be upheld if challenged in the court of law.   "43754.7347222222 So, basically  ### can happen is the sheriff contact Facebook about my being on their site. I can't be charged with a felony.Thank you for your assistance. It is much appreciated.43763.8916666667 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and I am very sorry this happened to you.  I hope you are feeling as well as possible, and that things will ### with no permanent or long-term effects on your health or ###.  While I think it entirely appropriate to consult at least once with a local personal injury lawyer who handles slip and fall cases, I can still offer you a few general remarks for future follow-up when you are ready to discuss the incident with legal counsel in more detail.First, as you may know, a fall by itself on someone else's premises (whether a natural person, corporation or other party with legal status) does not necessarily ### that the owner is going to be held liable as a matter of law.  What matters is whether the owner acted unreasonably, or negligently, in a manner that was both the factual and legal cause of the person's injuries.  There is a particular standard for places open to the general public, such as grocery stores, where a lot of slip and fall situations occur (usually in the produce section, for reasons I am sure you understand).  When a person falls in a grocery store, special attention will be paid to (###) how the liquid substance ended up on the floor, (###) whether the store had a policy of routine inspections of the floors, and (###) whether such ### were complied with by the staff.  For example, many grocery stores have checklists in their bathrooms, or in the ### just outside the produce areas, that staff members are supposed to initial or check after completing an inspection for dangerous conditions every ### (that is often the time interval considered reasonable but that is not set in ### as to the law).  This is not a guarantee that no one will ever get hurt if a child spills grapes or lemonade samples in a produce section just after the Food Lion employee did his/her last safety check, but the co###y's rationale is that doing these routine checks will greatly reduce the chance of incidents like yours.When a co###y has been deemed negligent it must have acted in a way that fell below the standard of what a reasonable person would have done under similar circumstances.  If Food Lion can show that it did indeed routinely inspect the premises where you fell, that will likely diminish the monetary value of whatever claim you might otherwise assert, whether privately or through litigation, against the store.  If it becomes clear, however, that had Food Lion taken a few more reasonable precautions to prevent this incident from happening, your injuries would have been less or nonexistent, that would strengthen your claim.  Ultimately, how much you would be paid for damages would depend on what your medical records show, how soon after the accident happened did you consult a healthcare professional, and also whether you are likely to suffer any long-term i###rment, or require future medical treatment.  All this, and other factors that you and legal counsel can discuss, go into evaluating whether your claim is viable.This is a broad overview, which I admit does not fully treat the matter you raised, but it at least gives you an idea as you ponder your options.  Your next step is to find a reputable personal injury lawyer and consult with him/her about pursuing this.  Many personal injury lawyers will consult with you for ### ###, or for reasonable cost.  You can use ### Find a Lawyer" feature and/or contact the North Carolina Bar Association and Wake County Bar Association for possible referrals.

I think that your neighbor is likely not personally liable since he does not appear to have been negligent, but rather that this damage occurred as a result of natural conditions (i.e., heavy rain, which none of us control).  However, I would think that either your or your neighbor's homeowner's insurance policy would cover this.  I would start by asking your own provider whether this is covered in your policy, and if not, you may need to ascertain whether your neighbor's insurance policy would do so.  Absent being able to ### this, you will likely need to sue the neighbor in order to (###) find out whether a policy exists covering this damage, and/or (###) recover damages from either your neighbor or his provider.  I understand that you cannot presently afford a lawyer for litigation, and hopefully it will not come to that.  But generally speaking, this is what we are dealing with at present.I hope this gives you at least a place at which to begin.  You can also search for insurance and real property lawyers using ### Find a Lawyer" feature in case you need to find someone with whom to have at least a brief (### ###) consultation on this matter which would either be free or reasonably priced for someone on a tight budget.

First, I am very sorry this happened to you, as no one would want to go through this.  If you have not yet been able to obtain your pet and your personal belongings, I would send a written letter by certified mail to your girlfriend's home or work (or hand deliver it), demanding within a reasonable time the option of retrieving your property, and if the items are of any value and they are not returned to you, you might consider suing for their fair market value in small claims court.  Hopefully you will not have to do this, as it would be ### to all concerned, but that is an option if you cannot otherwise get back your property, and the property is of sufficient value that you could not walk away from this with peace of mind.You can probably find a general practitioner in a small firm in ### County to advise you as to the content, for###d substance of your final demand letter, and the small claims court possibility if you desire in-person guidance from local counsel.Whatever you decide, I hope that this situation can be amicably and peacefully resolved, assuming it has not been already since you posted this question.Have a productive and deeply rewarding fall.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43725.2618055556 My girlfriend wanted to kick me out and set me up to be aggresive after initiating an argument. After being pushed around and held ### against my will I lashed out and tried to break the glass door with a statue. Statue shattered door was fine. Was allowed back in then. Police were called and I was escorted off the premises. When I returned later to retrieve my wallet dog and wheelchair I was threatened yet again with police intervention. I returned the following day and was tild if I took my dog or wasnt off the property by the time my girlfriend got home the police would be called again. Seeing as I was told that from the prior nights events I would be arrested I did just that. Leaving behind my dog and a few personal documents I couldnt find.43707.2784722222 I was hit and my car was totaled. The other driver was ticketed and there is a witness statement.

I acknowledged that the lead ### driver yielded to me, I  waved back and began making a left turn to go ###. As I began my turn around the yielding driver my daughter and I were struck, injured and my car was totaled. The ### lane was backed up behind the yielding driver for atleast a quarter mile or more. The driver that hit me never entered the road way legally instead drove the center median in an attempt to bypass all standing traffic. This statement was made to me at the scene along with the statement that I shouldn't worry it would all be taken care of because she had good insurance. I am a previously disabled person who is now in need of ongoing treatment. Due to state insurance laws even if I am  ###%  negligent I must pay through my coverage.

Attaching police report for clarity. Thank you."43709.5541666667 Ms. ###:Thank you for posting this important question in this venue.  I hope you had a good Labor Day, and have had a rewarding summer notwithstanding this accident.  Should you decide to sue anyone in civil court for property damage and/or personal injury from this accident, the ###% contributory negligence rule that you already alluded to in your posting would all but surely defeat your claim.  The defendant's insurance defense lawyer will plead contributory negligence as an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, and your civil complaint would either be dismissed in the early stages of litigation, or the defendant would likely win a little later in the case, through a motion for su###y judgment (if not through a motion for judgment on the pleadings beforehand).  Due to the high importance of this situation, however, I strongly advise that you seek a more thorough opinion than any lawyer can provide through this website, and share all facts and details with counsel just to be sure that I am not missing anything.  If a personal injury lawyer advises you that you might still have a case despite the possibility of a contributory negligence defense (in which case you might be able to plead the doctrine of last clear chance" to save your lawsuit from dismissal or su###y judgment in favor of the defendant) I am sure that s/he will honestly say so.Fortunately many if not all personal injury lawyers will offer you a ### ### initial consultation for free or very low cost.  Take all your relevant police reports medical records and any other documentation to counsel for review and you will then know for sure whether there is any chance of going forward.For help in finding a good personal injury lawyer in ### who handles car accidents consider using ### "Find a Lawyer" feature as well as the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association and by contacting the ### County Bar for a list of referrals.

This is hard to answer with certainty without knowing all the details of the situation, obtained through a back-and-forth conversation with a lawyer your consult with or retain.  Generally speaking, if the ### was the cause of the damage, the ### in ###'s position would not be liable since it did not negligently or intentionally cause the damage, but if this situation were brought before either your homeowner's insurance or ###'s insurance, there might be factors at play of which I am not aware that could i###t whether either party's insurance would cover the damage to your fence.  I would first take it up with your own insurance provider, and if it is not covered under your policy, ask them what ideas they have as to having the fence repaired without going out of pocket (if possible, but once again, this may be considered an Act of God" for which no one is directly responsible).  If no helpful ideas issue forward consider consulting with a real property or land use lawyer in your city and seeking an initial consultation.

We had not been to mediation yet or have an agreement in place for our three kids so I stayed. For two months he followed me around, screaming, making threats, saying he was taking the kids if I didnâ€™t leave, telling me Iâ€™m crazy, saying it was his money and his house etc. Last week he was aggressive in front of my daughters and father and after continuing to scream at me my dad took him in another room to calm him down. I went out to show him my financial contribution from last month and he began criticizing and belittling me and ### the remote at the papers- smiling. He turned on the camera to film me yelling and I reached for his phone (he has been filming me non-stop for ###). My dad was sitting right next to me and realized what he was doing as he is yelling â€œsheâ€™s  assaulting me, Iâ€™m being assaultedâ€ and pulled me away from the room. Dad was right and two days later he took out a temporary 50b saying I assaulted him and was physically scared of me. They granted it and I had one hour to leave the home. I can see my kids but am living in hotels and do not have access to any assets or other family money. They continued the ### ###. I am not able to go within ###. The day he claimed I assaulted him was the deadline for him to turn over financial documents for mediation. I have an eyewitness account of the night he claims I assaulted him and letters from witnesses to his physical and emotion abuse towards me over the years and a threatening text chain from the day he took out the 50b saying if I did not leave he would file. He was also aggressive with my mom the day I had to leave the house and once she started yelling turned on the camera ### her on saying this will be great for court. Meanwhile my ### ###. I have video of numerous threats of the same and of him screaming and talking down to me. I have not been able to find an attorney who understands what he is doing and Iâ€™m afraid I could lose everything.Iâ€™m currently displaced, he is actively telling people I am an abuser and that is how he got a restraining order, is bashing me in front of my kids- including sitting them down and making them watch the video of me grabbing his phone (even they told him they donâ€™t see me touch him- just his phone) and I am in fear of losing my career. From a domestic violence prospective, given his past behavior and timing with the separation, is there anything I can do to protect myself?43708.3618055556 https://www.dropbox.com/s/nu1dukg00kszoja/Video%20Aug%2002%2C%2010%2030%2005%20AM%20%281%29.mov?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/qchun1wlioywxxj/Video%20Aug%2002%2C%2010%2030%2005%20AM.mov?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/e87e0nj61w9ra4z/Video%20Aug%2018%2C%2012%2013%2058%20PM.mov?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/l0widzid4dxf77i/Video%20Aug%2012%2C%209%2021%2022%20AM.mov?dl=043708.7590277778 I hada garage door go bad and called a firm to fix it.

While wrongful death law in North Carolina is quite complex and ### dozens of ###, I think I can offer a few observations that might add to your peace of mind.  Generally, the personal representative of an estate of a person who allegedly died as a result of an injury caused by another must prove several things: first, that the defendant committed either an intentional or negligent act; second, that the act or omission was the factual cause of the injuries leading to the decedent's demise; third, that in addition to factual causation, the defendant's wrongful acts were the legal cause of the injuries leading to death, on the grounds that the demise of the person was, or should have been, reasonably foreseeable to the defendant when the wrongful acts were committed; and fourth, there must be resulting damages that are recognizable under law, that a personal representative can seek in the decedent's stead, on behalf of the decedent's heirs/beneficiaries.  If the plaintiff can prove each of these four elements, there is at least ### on its face, a viable wrongful death claim.It is all but unlikely that you would be held liable for your father's death if your worst enemy can say nothing more (whether truthful or not) that you were insufficiently supportive of your father as he struggled with his alcoholism; this accusation, even if true, is not enough to hold you legally responsible for any death or serious injury that your father might sustain as a result of his untreated addiction.  Absent you intentionally or negligently causing fatal injury to your father, in short, there can be no wrongful death liability imputed to you in a court of law.While I assume that an intentional act is fairly easy to mentally ###, what exactly would constitute a negligent act or omission?"  Examples are numerous but a couple would include instances in which you were the caregiver of your father yet you took no action to inform someone if your father made a credible suicidal attempt; or if you supplied him with alcohol knowing that he was on the edge of doing something dangerous to himself; or if he were at your home or was in your presence under a special relationship of trust yet you did nothing when you had reason to know that something potentially fatal was happening or soon to happen.  Again I stress that not "being supportive enough" according to someone else's definition of that by itself is not sufficient to hold you responsible.  I would in addition to the other things you have tried to do (mentioned in your posting) consult with any local or nearby mental health facilities that can provide you more practical (rather than legal) guidance about how you might handle your father's resistance to treatment or intervention. Admittedly I do not know everything that is going on here but as best I can tell you have not done anything (at least based on what you wrote here) that would persuade any experienced competent plaintiff's lawyer to believe that you could be liable in a wrongful death lawsuit after your father passes.  If you need a more precise detailed analysis than what I can properly provide here based on limited information you could always call or email a wrongful death lawyer and schedule a ### ### consultation so that you could discuss this with a lawyer who would eventually know more about this situation than I do online.  I hope this helps you somewhat and allows you to breathe a little easier about your own role in this situation.God bless you your father and your family this fall.  I know that this is a very heavy burden for a daughter to bear.

I need a lawyer to appear on my behalf.43712.7354166667 Ms. ###:Good question.  First, to begin with the obvious, you would not pay pack a deposit that you never were required to furnish upfront.  What is more in the gray area is whether you could be assessed" charges for repairs maintenance renovations etc. that would ensue to get your old home up to the landlord's liking before another tenant moves in.  Generally the answer is no.  Under the North Carolina Landlord-Tenant Act a tenant is not responsible for normal wear and tear; this is the landlord's burden to address and you are only responsible for damage caused by your intentional reckless or negligent acts (if any existed not saying that they did).  Absent that any cleaning replacement of blinds or any other remedial efforts to address normal wear and tear are not your responsibility.I would reach out to a local landlord-tenant real property or general practice lawyer and ask him/her to send an advisory letter to the landlord about this.  Be sure to also look at your lease ahead of time to make sure there is no language lurking in there about your assuming responsibility for charges for wear and tear.  If cost is an issue call your closest office of Legal Aid of NC and ask if they will briefly represent you in making sure that the landlord is advised of what charges can be assessed against the client and which ones not.Hopefully this matter will be clarified soon.Best wishes to you this fall### A. ### ### Esq."43714.1430555556 My question is, If I did not pay a deposit when I moved in to the place I used to live at, can the old landlord make me pay anything after I moved out for cleaning fees and exterminator fees?

Be well.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43714.6256944444 Mr. ###:Thank you for posting this very important question.  I think this is a very strong case against the landlord.  I would consult with a local personal injury lawyer as soon as you can.  Assuming you can show that your injuries resulted directly from the landlord's negligent maintenance of the floors, you should be able to recover against the landlord for your medical bills, pain and suffering, and possibly other ### or hardship damages, depending on the specific facts.  A personal injury lawyer can explain more.From the landlord-tenant perspective, I can offer a few points.  First, you cannot unilaterally withhold rent in North Carolina without court order, so for the time being, at least, keep paying rent until this tenancy is ended one way or another.  In the alternative, you could sue the landlord for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, codified at N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-4###.  In Â§ 4###-4###(a)(1) and (###), specifically, the landlord has failed to meet her standard of care in providing fit and habitable" premises and under Â§ 4###-4###(a)(8)(b) unsafe flooring is considered an "### dangerous condition" that subjects the landlord to further liability.  In such situations where the landlord has had both "actual notice" of the problem and a "reasonable time" to repair the habitability defect the tenant is empowered to sue the landlord for breach of the implied warranty of habitability seeking as damages rent abatement for the period of time in which the defect went unaddressed despite the landlord knowing about it and having time to repair it.  Generally speaking rent abatement in North Carolina is calculated as fair rental value of premises as warranted minus fair rental value of premises as defective plus any special or consequential damages.  Normally this would be filed in small claims court but since you have a potentially good case here for both personal injury and breach of the implied warranty of habitability I would ask a lawyer about combining the two lawsuits into one in either District Court or Superior Court depending on the value of your damages (up to $###5### whereas anything over that amount would be suitable for Superior Court).You will also want to include in whatever lawsuit you file information about the landlord's failure to keep the heating and cooling systems in good working order (while failure to provide AC during summer is not considered an "### dangerous condition" under Â§ 4###-4###(a)(8) there is still an obligation to keep the AC in working order under Â§ 4###-4###(a)(###) if the landlord provided AC with the unit when the tenant assumed lawful possession).Lastly keep in mind that the landlord cannot lawfully evict you simply because you demand that she meet her legal duty to you under the North Carolina Landlord-Tenant Act (N.C.G.S. Chapter 4###)--a demand that you as the tenant have every right to make.  Responding to such a reasonable and lawful demand by evicting a tenant is a "retaliatory" eviction and is considered illegal under N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-37.1 (Article 4A of the NC Landlord-Tenant Act).  Read this statutory provision online very carefully and note that under Â§ 4###-37.### a magistrate or judge is obligated to deny the landlord's complaint for su###y ejectment when a retaliatory eviction has been found based on the evidence on the court date.  You can have your lawyer send the landlord an expedited letter warning her of what the law clearly says about this and the potential consequences that may ensue if she follows through on her intentions in bad faith.### "Find a Lawyer" feature is a good (and free) vetting resource for lawyers to represent you and you might also consider the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association.Blessings and best wishes to you this fall and may your surgery and convalescence both be ### developments.### A. ### ### Esq."43714.0923611111 The air and heat also has quit working she will not respond to any phone calls or texts.

I was browsing on NC Free Legal Answers and just noticed this question, although I wish I had seen it previously and responded.  What I see here is the issue of whether your mother-in-law made a valid gift of real property; the only way to do this is by a written and notarized deed of gift (preferably by general warranty deed, although non-warranty or quitclaim could also be valid instruments).  If all you had for this gift was a verbal agreement, that would not be sufficient for ownership title to vest in you and your husband, and if that is the case, your mother-in-law could lawfully regain possession of the house, assuming she went through the proper procedures by sending you a written notice to terminate, followed by su###y ejectment proceedings if you did not leave by the effective date.If there is a deed to this property in which you and your husband are the grantees, consult briefly with a local real estate lawyer and have him/her send an appropriate letter to your mother-in-law explaining why the law is on your side.  Otherwise, it is only a matter of time before the mother-in-law regains possession if she is still the record title owner of the property.For future reference, it is N.C.G.S. Â§ 22-2, North ### Statute of Frauds provision, that determines that interests in real property must be in writing in order to be legally effective.  I hope this clarifies the issues a bit for you, even though I totally understand that this is unwelcome news.  I do hope that you and your husband can transition to a stable situation, with peace of mind, as you think of what to do next, and while taking care of yourself before and after your surgery.  God bless both of you richly this fall.Best,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43728.9715277778 In ### (my husband) and I a home stating that this is what he father wanted prior to his death.

Please help me help my daughter43721.8013888889 Ms. Blue, it is not clear from your post the context in which the school is refusing to allow your daughter you have her lunch period or what they are questioning her about.  However, if the school is not abiding by your daughter's IEP, or you have concerns about how her specially designed instruction is being implemented, you have several options: ###) you can contact the school, and request an IEP meeting.  Prior to the meeting, let the school know what your concerns are;  ###) You can file a state complaint with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.  Information about filing the complaint, including the complaint template can be found here ###; or ###) you can contact an education attorney to discuss your options and possible remedies. 43747.6097222222 Good evening, ###:Thank you for your question.  I think this depends on the specific language of the lease agreement, and whether it specifies a certain minimum threshold for liability coverage.  If you are below that threshold required, it is possible that the landlord could assess further charges, although it could not lawfully do so if you are at or above the minimum required in the lease.  Without knowing the specifics of that, I cannot say for certain whether the landlord is acting properly, although it is possible that it is.If you have proof that you are in compliance with the lease, retain a local real property or landlord-tenant lawyer to review your lease and renter's policy, and to send a letter of warning to the landlord to stop assessing the extra (and unwarranted) charges.Best wishes to you,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43724.9270833333 I have the proper coverage limits & Thanks for the advice.43725 Ok, sounds like an attorney's letter to the landlord would be your next step, if the landlord does not immediately relent in assessing extra charges.  Any improper assessments already made should be credited against your next rental installment.  Be well,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43725.0041666667 They are charging me $###.

In some cases, those witnesses may not have been called for good reason. We would recommend that you speak directly with your attorney about why he or she decided the way they did in your case. There are usually good reasons. This conversation with your lawyer would be the time to ask about an appeal or any other next steps.43764.6076388889 My attorney did not call any of my witnesses which were subpoenaed  , ###  .

I just now saw this question on the website and noticed that no one had yet responded to you.  Assuming you still need help with this, I would contact the traffic court in Guilford County by phone or personal visit, and ask this question of the traffic magistrate, or one of the assistant DAs available there.  You may have to personally visit and ask for a brief continuance to complete the course, then appear on your extended date and show proof that you completed all course requirements to have your charge dismissed.  That is how I would go about this if I were unrepresented by legal counsel, and have still not completed the course as of today.

You can ### this if you effectively ### your reserves of energy and strength.43727.6256944444 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I see three components here, which I can briefly discuss in answering your concerns.  These components are (###) the issue of your boyfriend's alleged drug use; (###) the issue of outstanding rent obligations after vacating the premises; and (###) rent liability of co-signers or guarantors on the lease.  Let's examine each component in sequence.First, as you already are likely aware, landlords can, under both the lease agreement and North Carolina law generally, expedite an eviction, or demand that a tenant vacate early, based on alleged criminal activity on the premises.  The standard of the landlord's proof is by the preponderance of the evidence or 5###% certainty.  As best I can tell, the landlord is enabled by law to demand an early vacating of your boyfriend based on the report the landlord was given per your description.The second factor relates to how far ahead rent can be charged, even after a landlord ### a tenant, or a tenant breaks" the lease.  When these disputes end up before a magistrate the standard period of time that a magistrate will allow the landlord to continue charging the tenant is two months.  The reason is that NC caselaw indicates that a two-month period is generally considered sufficient for the landlord to meet his/her statutory obligation to use "best efforts and due diligence" in finding a substitute tenant.  After the landlord's grace period is over it is the landlord's burden to find the substitute and the tenant is no longer responsible for rent.  However during whatever transition period is considered "reasonable" for the landlord the tenant must still pay rent.  Therefore if the landlord sues you because you have not paid for October it is likely (though not necessarily guaranteed) that the landlord will prevail and a judgment entered against you for the unpaid October installment.  My educated guess is that unless you left the premises in a really bad condition as to require extensive renovation and repair the landlord's duty to mitigate damages by due diligence and best efforts will have ended by the end of November at latest.  But please be aware that what is considered a "reasonable" period to mitigate damages will depend in part on the magistrate who hears your case in addition to the specific facts of each and every case.(The paragraph immediately above tracks closely more or less with Paragraph ###.)Finally yes any guarantor of payment or cosigner on the lease can ultimately be held responsible for defaults and payments should the primary occupants/tenants on the lease not pay the rent owed.  Normally the landlord will first demand payment of the tenants then demand against the ### if the first attempt at securing payment is unsuccessful.Hope these general points help and that something ### adverse to you and your boyfriend (and of course the guarantor in this situation) can be worked out shortly.  Have a blessed ### and productive fall.### A. ### ### Esq."43726.8131944444 Ms. ###:I am sy###hetic to your financial ### (having been there before myself), but my answer does not change.  Yes, October is well within the due diligence period, and no, the magistrate will not take into account your personal situation.  I am not guaranteeing that the magistrate will make you pay for October, but am simply ### what I believe to be the likely result, based on how these cases are typically adjudicated in small claims court.  Every magistrate is different from the others, but this two-month rule is fairly standard in North Carolina.  Any landlord-tenant lawyer will tell you something similar.I can totally understand being frustrated.  I hope for everyone's sake that the financial picture here can improve.  I realize how precious peace of mind is when trying to tackle life's myriad challenges.  That is my sincere hope and ### for you.Thank you for following up.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43726.8951388889 Thank you again for your response... just another question: should they return my security deposit with ###? The lease agreement says 'no longer then ###'. I was told that if they keep my security deposit for 'repairs' I can ask for the invoices they had to pay to fix whatever had to be fixed. We only lived in the apartment for ###... there's no damages  to it except some scratches on the carpet from my roommate's dog. Does the pet deposit covers that? 43727.5611111111 Thank you very much. I appreciate your insight and I hope you have a blessed day. And thank you ### the much needed prayers. You're a nice lawyer. 43727.6215277778 Thanks for the quick reply and I really appreciate your insight. I'm not questioning your response I just want to make sure I understand correctly regarding the second factor: I have an obligation to still pay October's rent even though the apartment management has not listed the apartment for rent? Aren't they breaking their part on the contract for not 'exercising customary diligence to relet and mitigate damages'? We make $###, we're living in my aunt's house, we have to go to may parents for dinner so I can eat once a day, our roommate who was a minor and couldn't be on the lease has moved to a different county and hasn't give me any money for rent since the beginning of August... I know you have nothing to do with it but will a magistrate take that into account? I can't keep paying rent to my aunt and there and save money for security deposit to a new place. Sorry I'm just very frustrated... 43726.8527777778 While I was on vacation last month my boyfriend got kicked out of the apartment we had rented together. He had ###. The apartment complex management informed us that by leaving in ###'t go against us as an eviction; however, breaking the lease has consequences. They said we would have to pay the rent until the apartment was rented to someone else. It's been a month, new rent is due now in October and our apartment has not been rented and it's nor even available to rent (not on the market).They have not done anything to the apartment since we moved out. I had a friend specifically ask for that floor plan and she was told there's none available. Since we signed a lease for ### ###... do they have the right to charge us for the next ###? How long do they have until the apartment should be put out for rent? Do we have any right not to pay October's rent since they are not doing any effort to rent the apartment? We're living as a favor now with my aunt but we need to move out but we can't afford to rent another place and pay this one. Please help. Another question I have, can they come after my mom since she signed as our guarantor? It's very stressful dealing with this management company.... I lost my job too and was out of work for ###. I'm starting a new job today which is good and release some of the pressure but I won't have money to pay rent in October. I also have to pay car insurance since I need to drive me and my boyfriend to work. FYI- my boyfriend was kicked out for drug related activity. He thinks the neighbors might have heard and smell weed and called the cops. The property has s rule that drug related activity is a reason the get kicked out. I have attached our lease agreement and the chain email where my friend asked for an apartment with that floor plan and they said it's not available. 43726.6041666667 Yes, you should get a deposit back within ###, per N.C.G.S. Â§ ###.  I would guess that the pet deposit will cover the scratches, although there may not be any deductions or charges since this all sounds like normal wear and tear.  To the extent that you may be charged at all, it would likely come from the pet deposit, although I cannot say so for sure.  Be sure that you leave a forwarding address with the landlord to ensure timely refund of the security deposit.Take care.43727.6173611111 I am a single mother who is seeking help on obtaining a lawyer for custody hearing and abuse from the other parent. 43727.5659722222 I suggest that you contact the NCBA Lawyer Referral Service at ### or call ###-###.  They will help you find a lawyer in your area who can help you with your custody problem.43735.6868055556 Good morning,The good news is that there is a process in North Carolina for the recall of an arrest warrant.  There will need to be filed with the appropriate court a motion to recall order for arrest (this would most likely be what was referenced as the blue sheet recall).  Generally speaking, your attorney will need to file the recall request with the office of Clerk of Court.  You've identified your location as ### County, so that would be: https://###countyclerk.com/ in downtown ###.  If the warrant came from a different jurisdiction in North Carolina, you'll need to find the Superior Court for that county. Each county in North Carolina is different, but there may be another option:  I would suggest contacting the District Attorney's office and explaining to them the warrant you received.  In some counties in North Carolina, the District Attorney and the Court may sign a motion to recall the arrest warrant without first receiving a recall request.  If you contact the District Attorney and explain that you have the community service hour records, they may ask you to provide those records to them so they can clear the case.  Even if they are unable to assist you in resolving it, you will then know if you need to pursue the path of filing a motion in court to have the warrant recalled.   If you are unable to afford an attorney, I would suggest promptly contacting the ### office of Legal Aid of North Carolina (http://www.legalaidnc.org/get-help/find-an-office?k=###&t=Title; ###-###).  If you want to push forward on your own or Legal Aid is unable to assist, I would suggest contacting the office of the Clerk of Court (referenced above) and asking them if there is a required form of the recall order.  They may a form that the judges in ### County want to use.   If you have contacted the District Attorney and worked through Legal Aid, and have had no resolution, I would suggest you resubmit this question to this website, asking for assistance in preparing a motion to recall order for arrest.  One other idea: if your son is in college at a university that also has a law school, he should consider approaching the law school.  Many law schools have pro bono clinics where law students and faculty assist on cases presented to them. That could be an option.   Thank you. 43738.6354166667 What can we do to stay out of court and turn his hours in. We thought the place turns them in but obviously not and they were complete but now heâ€™s ###. His name is ### D. ### ###. They say something about a blue sheet recall. And also we donâ€™t know his next court date if one. Canâ€™t afford an attorney but need help. Thank you!43727.7701388889 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I am very sorry you have been through such an ordeal.  Luckily, however, you have more flexibility to leave this situation since you do not have a formal rental agreement; therefore, you have what is called an implied periodic tenancy the notice requirements for which are governed by N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-14.  Either party, landlord or tenant, can terminate a periodic tenancy (either verbally or in writing, though written format is the best practice).  The amount of notice required in advance depends on how often rent is paid: for year-to-year tenancies, notice to terminate must be ### ###, whereas it is seven days for month-to-month, and two days for week-to-week.  For tenancies at will, no time is required.  So Part ###.Part ###: based on what you describe here, the landlord has clearly violated the implied warranty of habitability, found at N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-42.  Not only does a landlord have a duty to [###e all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition" under N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-42(a)(2) but also under Â§ 42-42(a)(8)(l) standing water or flooding problems that lead to mold are considered an "### dangerous condition" that must be rectified within a "reasonable time" of the landlord having "actual notice" of the defect.  So if the landlord has had a reasonable time to make adequate repairs and has not done so this further compounds the landlord's breach of the implied warranty of habitability.This gives you the chance to sue the landlord in small claims court alleging specifically the instances in which the landlord violated N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-42 and asking for the remedy of rent abatement.  Rent abatement is calculated according to the following formula: fair rental value as warranted minus fair rental value in defective condition plus any additional consequential or incidental damages you incurred as a result of the landlord's breach.  The magistrate has broad discretion to decide what monetary amount should be awarded for your damages.  Having a judgment against the landlord (which the landlord will likely pay in order to avoid having his/her credit damaged for the next couple years) will allow you some monetary relief from whatever financial ### you are currently facing if you can simply get to this point in time by filing a small claims suit and getting to the court date within the ### case heard.I recommend reaching to the local Legal Aid of NC office in ### and asking if they can take your case; if so you will be represented for this suit without having to pay legal fees (although you may have to pay the $96.### $30.### but ask if you can get one of these waived).For your reference and information I immediately below include two ### is to the statutory warranty of habitability so that you can read up on the landlord's duties in preparation for small claims and the second is Rule ### governing how a defendant in a lawsuit can be served with the complaint and summons available from the Clerk of Court.  I include Rule ### (it is manageable if you really have to so do not worry or panic).  Remember that if you decide to personally deliver the complaint and summons you will need to immediately type up and have notarized an "Affidavit of Service which should be filed asap with the Clerk, alongside the ### copy of the complaint and summons, so that the magistrate hearing your case will know, on the day of your hearing, that the defendant was properly served.  Otherwise, the magistrate might dismiss your case, requiring you to file all over again.See N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-###: ###See N.C. Civ. Pro. Rule ###: ###(pay special attention to Rule 4(j)(1) for service of legal process upon natural persons ###ing individuals as opposed to corporations or organizations)Hope this helps.

To give you more information about custody and how it works: There are two kinds of custody: Legal custody and Physical custody.A parent who has sole legal custody can make major decisions about the childâ€™s life without consulting the other parent. If parents have joint legal custody, then they must consult one another and jointly make major decisions, such as where the child will attend school or whether the child will have a major medical procedure. If the parents cannot agree, a court may have to make the decision.Sole physical custody means that the child lives with one parent only, though the child may visit with the other parent. Joint physical custody means that the childâ€™s time is split between the parents. There are many possibilities for joint physical custody. One parent may have primary physical custody, meaning the child lives with that parent most of the time, while the other parent has secondary physical custody, for example, every other weekend, or regularly scheduled dinner visits. Alternatively, there may be an equal split in which the child alternates between the parents on a regular basis. (### )            To obtain either sole legal or physical custody when the other parent does not agree the arrangement requires a custody order.  â€œA parentâ€™s custody rights â€¦ [depends] on the type of relationship with the parent that is in the childâ€™s best interests.â€ ###  Custody mediation is the first step in obtaining a custody order, and is a â€œconversation between the parents assisted by a professional mediator.â€  If custody mediation is unsuccessful, and a judge ends up deciding which parent should obtain sole custody, they can consider:many factors, such as the parentsâ€™ living arrangements, each parentâ€™s ability to care for the child, the childâ€™s relationship with each parent, and any other factors affecting the welfare of the child. While fairness to the parents is important, this is secondary to the childâ€™s welfare. A partyâ€™s shortcomings as a spouse or relationship partner will generally only carry substantial weight if they also impact the partyâ€™s parenting abilities.A court will attempt to make a decision that is in the best interests of the child, and Domestic Violence is something that will require the court to protect a child. It is recommended your sister bring evidence to either the mediator or to a court hearing, detailing the violence and drug use will allow the judge to make a decision that protects the child.If you would like to hire a family law attorney but do not know where to find one, I recommend calling the Lawyer Referral Service: https://www.ncbar.org/public-resources/lawyer-referral-service/.Best of luck!43762.7694444444 This question is pertaining to my sister.

Thank you ### ### 43731.5993055556 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your civil procedure question.  Rule ###, very broad, and is intended to include anything that (###) is directly relevant to the issues in litigation, or (###) indirectly, is likely to lead to relevant evidence that would be admissible at trial, should the case eventually get to that point.  This is where being a non-lawyer is a great disadvantage, given that rules of evidence and procedure are highly nuanced areas of the law that require years of education and training to fully master; even lawyers with several years of litigation experience get tripped up in these matters when not precise or careful.  I cannot simply read your phrase, does not pertain to the case and tell you whether that is really true, since that is a legal conclusion that does not include specific facts.  What I can tell you though, after having read hundreds of discovery requests over the past ### years, is that many discovery requests (interrogatories, requests for admission, document productions, etc.) will feature queries that do not on their face seem relevant but in fact are so because of what information they can lead to.  Discovery is intended under Rule ###. The best you can do is offer the information that you believe falls within Rule ###6, and then object if you believe that the query improperly ### information that is privileged, already a part of public record, or is overly burdensome or cumbersome to produce; and if your objection is not sufficiently supported by law or procedural rule, be aware that the opposing lawyer will almost certainly file a Motion to Compel Discovery (after privately registering his objection to your own objections, allowing you one ### chance to comply).  If a hearing becomes necessary on whether you should fully comply with the discovery request, and you lose, the opposing side can ask for you to be sanctioned by the court, and pay attorney's fees for the preparation of the motion and appearance at the hearing.  This can possibly run you between $###,### $5,000, depending on the complexity of the issue litigated.  So if you wish to object, read Rules ### ###, and make sure you are on solid legal ground before tendering your objections to opposing counsel.  ### on this end can cost you a lot.I wish you the best in your litigation matter.  Have a blessed and productive fall.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43732.7902777778 Personal questions that does not pertain to the case.

First, you always have the right to report a sexual assault (fro###brief touching, to anything worse) to law enforcement when it happens; having an investigation and police report made at least starts a paper trail for future reference, including that in an arrest, if the local authorities believe that is warranted.  Second, if this happened in the workplace, you should report this to your direct supervisor and HR person as soon as possible, so that this can be part of the permanent personnel file, once a workplace investigation is also made.  Lastly (at least for now), you can, independently of the criminal justice process, decide to sue this person in civil court for battery should you wish to do so.  You would want to work with a personal injury or general civil litigation lawyer on this angle.At the present moment, based on my limited information about this situation, these are the main three options you have.  At least the first two cost you nothing in terms of money, and both have a good chance of delivering a degree of justice for what happened to you.I hope your inquiries on this matter are productive and ###.

However, it would depends on the contract documents you have with the seller as to whether he or she (or it) can be liable to you.  For instance, if your contract documents ### warranties, then your remedies against the seller may be limited.  We assume you mean you were sold a car with new accident history on the Carfax report and your theory is the seller tampered with the Carfax report to eliminate the accident history on the Carfax report.  if that's the case, you likely have a claim against the seller, however, you need to check your contract documents with the seller. It also depends on what damages you are seeking.  For instance, what is the value of your car now versus what would the value have been had the accident not occurred?  Or, are you asking the seller to take the car back ?If you have not ### the car, i would recommend you send a demand letter to the seller you bought the car from for the relief you are seeking.  If you do not get a satisfactory response, consult a local lawyer about what potential claims you might want to pursue in court. You may also want to consider who you bought the car from. For instance, if you bought from an individual, your remedies may be limited.  However, if you bought from a reputable dealer, then the dealer may be more responsive to your demand in order to avoid bad publicity and expense of litigation.

Peace of mind is key.43737.7916666667 Ms. ###:God bless you and your family for what you are going through.  You have my prayers and my sincere support.  Assuming no guardianship action has been filed up to this point, you could petition the ### County Clerk of Superior Court (or that of another county, if your father is living there) for what is called guardianship of the person and that, in the absence of your father having the mental capacity to delegate to you otherwise, would allow you to make decisions as to where your father should live and be treated in his final illness, including hospice care when/if the time comes.  However, there is a wrinkle to this: even if no guardianship action has previously been filed, and your father's girlfriend has a healthcare POA that ### her to be the guardian of the person in any future guardianship lawsuit, the Clerk is obligated to at least consider your father's ### of the healthcare agent to serve, although that can be disregarded if the Clerk is persuaded during the guardianship proceedings that you are the better qualified person to act as guardian of the person.  I write this to you because, as a lawyer who drafts many healthcare ###, I know that many such instruments contain guardianship provisions that strongly favor the healthcare agent.  This is something for you to consider.Otherwise, if you do not file for guardianship of the person, the girlfriend will likely be able to override you on decisions as to your father's care.  If you happen to have a copy of the healthcare POA, read it carefully for any language relating to guardianships, and share with legal counsel if you need a lawyer's precise interpretation of the language; many lawyers would do this in an initial consultation for a relatively low fee.  I hope this at least gives you a sense of the direction in which to steer yourself next.  All the best to you and your family.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43736.0041666667 My father has stage ###.

First off, I am an autistic advocate, I have Autism and mild intellectual challenges, some other physical and mental disabilities. I am writing with the support of a friend. I was recently nominated for ### ###. I received a congratulations letter in the mail and a follow-up phone call to schedule a video interview. My coordinator called me and emailed me and all of my ### and the video interview was set up.  Two weeks later, I was notified by email that they had decided not to give me the award after all, they planned to select another recipient, with no explanation whatsoever. I tried to get an explanation but I only got very vague response back. No one else could get an answer from the ### either.  My coordinator, the director of the Autism Society of NC, supervisors in ### NC and the director of the ARC of NC tried to contact the ### for some accountability and answers. I also sent them a personal letter and weâ€™ve all been stonewalled. The ### has completely closed ranks, won't take phone calls on the matter, and only respond  to inquiries in writing with the same three sentence canned response and everyone agrees, it's really strange. One week after that, the award was given to a close friend of mine, who also happens to the board chair of my non-profit organization. This has caused a great deal of emotional distress for both of us. The council has made these decisions with blatant disregard for either one of us as people. Jade ultimately decided to turn down the award, but has been very shaken by the whole experience. This whole situation has triggered very intense PTSD, in which I have had trouble sleeping, I've had meltdowns, extreme bouts of anxiety and depression, I have cried for days. And I can't even get an answer from the ###, let alone a sincere apology.  Would I have any legal recourse for extreme emotional and psychological damage to the point of feeling physically sick? Or to possibly get any answers? Hopefully, you can let us know how we should move forward. Because everybody has been stomped and from an ethical point of view, this is really bad practice.43738.2131944444 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  I see no cause to proceed legally or formally based on the facts you stated here.  There is no inherent right for you to be awarded the honor even if you were one of the ### for the same, or whether the serious interest expressed to you raised expectations that you would be the winner, only to have those expectations dashed (fairly or unfairly).  The organization or entity making the final award has complete discretion to make its decision as its award committee sees fit, and it is not legally obligated to share with you insights into its internal ### leading up to the decision.  I am sorry this has caused you and your friend so much angst, and I hope you feel better about it now than before, but there is simply nothing to pursue further.I am confident that your advocacy and civic engagement is noted and appreciated by people who genuinely care about you, and/or the work that you do on behalf of noble causes, such as the dignity and rights of people with autism.  Certainly, you are to be commended for your good works in this manner.  My practical advice to you is to simply keep doing the good work that you have been committed to for some time, and sooner or later, the ### will come back to you ###.  People notice when reputable citizens are doing good work for others, and eventually, everyone catches on.Have a healthy, safe, blessed and productive autumn.Best wishes to you,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43747.1604166667 I wanted to state I  have ### dyslexia so I apologize sometimes I'll get help to write but I'm replying back on my own so it might not be as clear43747.2208333333 Mr. ###:This is all very hard to follow.  My answer does not change as to the award decision, but if you want to explore a defamation suit, you can always consult with a local civil litigation lawyer to determine whether this is worth your time and money (this will cost you thousands of dollars upfront, as most lawyers do not litigate defamation suits on a pure or even partial contingency basis).  Call a couple lawyers in town and see if they have any interest in helping you pursue this.Best wishes to you, again,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43747.2229166667 What shocked our community wasn't so much that they reverse their decision was the manner in which they did sell which I was recently told by my coordinator it triggered the Autism Society CEO got  involved in the actual have a meeting but them still refusing give answers.First ### ### Executive Director, FIRST  three agencies service providers for the directors got involved because of the manner of the way it was done cause a lot of emotional too stressed extreme emotional Distress other very fantastic support team which is has been a credible also talked about releasing a press release however some of the stuff I've been through in the past ### me about it. One of my main concerns with this is last year, my ex-girlfriend made a false accusation against me after we broke up in July. My ex-girlfriend was very unstable and accused me of sexual assault after I broke up with her, and then ended up having to block her from harassing me. Before the allegation, I had to block her from contacting me due to harassment over text message, Facebook and Instagram following the breakup. After blocking her and telling her to leave me alone, she wrote and delivered a ### letter to my father detailing the relationship, it was slanderous, horrible and very inappropriate. Then she filed a restraining order against me which was dismissed in court after the judge found I hadn't done anything wrong. But then she went on social media and told people I assaulted her. I spoke with the bar association before about possibly pursuing a defamation suit  from the Volunteer Attorney ###### at ###000487:###. ### am sorry to hear about your difficulties with your ex-girlfriend. Bad ### are not unusual but this one sounds as though it has gone much too far. I am glad to hear you managed to prevail in the 50B matter at least. I think you have correctly identified the main issue that remains in this case: your ex-girlfriend's statements on Facebook and elsewhere amount to defamation. Your main recourse for this is to sue her in small claims court. You perhaps already know this but it will be helpful when and if you decide to go to court to know the ###inology that the law uses. Defamation is a general ### for false injurious statements; if the statements are written (either in print or in an electronic format like a Facebook post) they are libel and if they are spoken aloud they are slander. In either case the legal standard is the same. I will discuss libel here because it seems most likely that you would be able to proceed on a libel claim given the existence of those Facebook posts but all the analysis below that applies to libel would also apply to slander if you can prove that your ex-girlfriend made oral statements." but after that she went quiet. Eventually she moved away. After all the hardship I need the time for healing so I decided not to pursue it but after recent events Now I'm concerned she may be the one responsible for the ### reversing their decision on this award - the news of me being selected for this award was published on social media prior to the reversal and this is exactly the kind of thing she's been known to do. If she is continuing to slander my name in this way I need to know so I can move forward with the defamation suit and protect the future of my career. I don't know what happened however I'm a  domestic abuse survivor protected from future attacks I want to able to feel safe "43747.2180555556 Good evening, ###:Thank you for posting this question.  Based on what you wrote in your helpfully detailed su###y, and after my reading your attached documents, I believe that your only legal option is to sue this person in small claims court for the amount that you are owed.  Small claims court is a relatively simple process, designed primarily for litigants without lawyers, for small amounts up to $###0,000.00.  The filing fee for a Complaint for Money Owed is $###, and the service of process fee through the Sheriff is $###, although you could serve, in the alternative, either by (###) certified mail, return receipt requested, or (###) personal service through hand delivery.  If you choose alternative (###), you would need to file the post office's ### return slip several days before the actual hearing date, and if you choose alternative (###), you would need to fill out and file an Affidavit of Service (notarized), in which you detail the circumstances by which you served the defendant with a Complaint and Summons (date, time, method, etc., as well as precise identification of the two parties).  An alias & ###" summons by itself is $###5.00 should you decide to serve by ###s other than the Sheriff.  It can sometimes be a little difficult in proving that the defendant was properly served under the requirements of Rule ### (look up online and read carefully here: https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_###A/GS_###A-###_Rule_4.pdf) so if I were you and you decide to sue you should ask for a date far enough out to give you time to have the defendant served at least ten (###0) days before the actual court date that you request from the Clerk when you file your paperwork at the courthouse.  On the date of your hearing you should bring any documents emails texts etc. proving the existence of this verbal agreement as well as the fact of the defendant's breach.  The magistrate will likely determine this case one way or the other within ### ###.  If the magistrate sides with you s/he will enter a judgment against the defendant which you can then try to execute against her assets.  If the judgment goes unpaid it will significantly lower her credit score for years so while that by itself is not a guarantee of being paid it is certainly a serious incentive to the debtor to pay this off since civil judgments in North Carolina are good for ten (###0) years subject to renewal for an additional ten (###0) years.You can find the forms (both civil complaint for money owed and alias and ### summons) at ### (look under "forms") as well as at the Clerk of Superior Court's office at the courthouse.  No lawyer is required for a case like this and this should be relatively easy to handle as long as you have the time and take the time to read over everything carefully in order to avoid any unnecessary mistakes.  Please note that you MUST file in the county where the defendant not the plaintiff lives or otherwise the magistrate will be statutorily required to dismiss the suit due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  This is an important detail that small claims plaintiffs often overlook to the detriment of their cases.While I am not necessarily advising you to sue I nonetheless provide this information for you to consider since small claims litigation is your only option if the debtor will not pay you voluntarily.  What you must now engage in is a thoughtful cost-benefit analysis as to whether the headache time and expense of formal legal action is justified based on what you hope to gain from this.  Only you can make this value judgment as it is based your own thinking rather than the law.  The statute of limitations for breach of contract situations (including verbal loan agreements) is three years under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###-5###(###).  Unless you two explicitly agreed to a set period of repayment the statute of limitations starts ticking from "a reasonable time" from the date of the creditor's demand for full repayment.  What is a "reasonable" time is a gray matter that is up for the court to determine based on all applicable facts before it.I hope this information is helpful to you.  This information plus any additional tips that the courthouse might give you along with your paperwork is more than enough to ### you with what you need to successfully pursue a small claims action.  I wish you a happy safe rewarding and productive fall.Blessings### A. ### ### Esq."43738.9263888889 To whom it may concern,I had a friend that I loaned money to over the course of our freshman year together.

I told her that I could not do that and have anybody push me over, and I am sure that nobody would either, and her response was that she owed me nothing" and she decided by herself that she would not pay the remaining amount.

This ### me too, although depending on how ### law is written (I admit I am not knowledgeable about ###'s contempt or bench warrant rules), the judge could have lawfully issued this bench warrant based on the underlying offense, rather than the actual court date (in which case contempt would usually be the reason, assuming you had the notice of a court date that you indicated you did not have).  The only way to effectively handle this going forward is to contact an ### criminal defense lawyer in or near the city where your warrant is pending, and ask if s/he can dispose of it for you while minimizing your criminal liability exposure.I recommend going to ### and using the free Find a Lawyer" feature.

He knows a got what was left from my pale Grant and is now demanding that I owe him some of it because our joint tax return determines the amount of Grant money I get.

"43740.0902777778 Ms./Mrs. ###:Thank you for your question.  By ### Grant return I a###suming you ### ### Grant application."  I do not see why your husband would be entitled to your application since you only are in school unless there is active litigation going on with respect to a divorce and your husband or his lawyer have made a legitimate discovery request that was served upon you personally.  In a divorce proceeding in which the judge has to make decisions about alimony spousal support and equitable distribution of marital property your ### Grant application would indeed be relevant and in that instance it would be foreseeable that your husband's lawyer would want to see it and examine it as evidence in the lawsuit.  But beyond that I see no legal basis for your husband to have this information.  If he cites a legal reason for his being entitled to this short of litigation discovery (such as a legitimate opinion from his CPA that he needs this as evidence to support his separate tax return which I would want confirmed by a CPA) or if you get a letter fro###lawyer requesting it this question can definitely be ###.  I think that your situation is to some degree in flux while you and your husband decide the fate of your marriage and property.

I work for a bank. 43741.6416666667 Hello, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I would say at this point that a defamation case will not likely yield you much in the way of monetary compensation.  Defamation requires four things: (###) a concrete statement of fact, (###) of and concerning the plaintiff, (###) written or spoken to a third party, (###) that causes economic damage or significant ### damage to the plaintiff.  Usually accusing someone of a crime would be enough to be liable if the accusation is not true, but there are a couple ### here on that angle that make this a little more complicated than might initially appear when we think of the word defamation" in its ###ing on the street.First the person making the false accusation must be proven to either have known that the accusation was untrue at the time it was made or had reason to know that it was not true.  When reporting criminal activity there is a qualified privilege of good faith that protects ### to law enforcement and prosecutors when the former sincerely believes that a crime was committed.  Even if the complainant turns out to be wrong the same is still protected from defamation liability as long as the complainant acted responsibly and within the scope of the ### qualified privilege.  So as long as your accuser was not outlandish in trying to have you charged you will not succeed in a defamation suit against that person.Also relevant are the factors of who the complainant spoke to about the accusations and also whether you actually suffered har### a result.  If the "third parties" I referred to above in Element (###) were law enforcement officers and prosecutors that is not inappropriate and for Element (###) you would need to show significant ### as losing your job due to the false accusations or something else very serious like being turned down in a job application process or losing standing in your local community.  Failure to show all four elements that I articulated above would defeat your lawsuit even if you were innocent of all things of which you were accused.Besides these legal details there are two practical considerations for you to think through as well.  First please keep in mind that most lawyers who handle defamation suits do not litigate based on contingency bases; they either charge hourly or they require no less than $5### with a percentage from the back end as well.  I am not aware of any legal colleagues who would do a case like this with no money up front.  Second even if you win you must consider whether the defendant has the financial ###s to pay a civil judgment; if not you might still have a judgment for ten (###0) years (subject to renewal for another ten (###0) years) but the defendant may still be "judgment proof" after s/he claims certain statutory exemptions of real and personal property from your judgement.  (North Carolina law is quite generous to civil defendants when it comes to exemptions from judgments.)  So the closet thing you might have to immediate gratification upon winning your suit is that you damaged the defendant's credit score for years but otherwise received nothing for yourself.These are some general observations to consider.  If you wish to explore in greater detail consult locally with a civil litigation lawyer who handles defamation claims.  Have a blessed safe and productive fall.### A. ### ### Esq."43740.8222222222 If you actually suffered harm by losing your job, yes, you would have a good argument for damages.  You actually have to suffer a legal injury" in order to sue someone for anything including defamation.  If you do not lose your job and your reputation and economic situation remains intact despite the false accusation you may have been defamed but you did not suffer damages in a legal sense even if you personally feel otherwise.  Hope that distinction makes sense as it is very important when contemplating a lawsuit.  With no damages the judge will dismiss your suit almost as soon as it is filed.  Best wishes and thank you for your follow up."43741.64375 It was brought to my attention that someone was gonna try to get me charge with felony credit card fraud. Which I have proof I didnâ€™t do!

I encourage you to consider writing Mr. ### a letter (which you can send via regular and certified mail and email). The letter should include his agreement to pay half of the monthly ###, which is X amount.

A lawsuit would need to be filed in the county where he lives.I hope this helps and I wish you the best of luck.43747.9736111111 If you are filing for absolute divorce, you can do that if you have been a resident for at least ### ###. You must be separated for at least one year to file an absolute divorce. Separation means that you are living separate and apart in two residences when at least one of you had the intention of being separated. If you are granted a divorce, you are prevented from filing claims for equitable distribution (dividing property and debts) and alimony (spousal support). If you need to divide property or need alimony, you have to work that out by contract (a separation agreement) before you file for divorce or you need to file claims for equitable distribution and/or alimony along with your divorce so that you can resolve it through court.A claim for absolute divorce does not settle custody or child support. If you need advice on those subjects, that's a separate issue. Your post was not clear on whether you had any of those other issues relating to your separation. If you do, please contact an attorney or post a follow up question. Also, if you are not yet separated, you cannot file for absolute divorce. You might have another claim that you can file relating to your marital separation.Thanks.43754.7604166667 Is there a number I can call to see if I can get an attorney to represent me with pro bono?I really want to leave back to Florida, but it's getting hard as I don't want to live my daughter.43755.5277777778 My name is Grace, I'm thinking about filing for divorce from my husband of almost ###.

I would like to file for divorce and move back to Florida where both my parents reside at. I would like to take my daughter with me as I don't want to leave her here. From my understanding can I not get a divorce in NC unless my husband and I have both been living in seperate places?I do not plan on asking for child support, alimony nor dividing of property maybe just debt, but what I really want is to know how can I apply for Pro Bono and see if I apply to get free legal help from an attorney to do this. I don't make enough to hire an attorney.Also if I wanted to live back to Florida before the divorce can I do so with my daughter? or do I need permission from the father to take her out of the state? She's only ###.43754.7875 To my knowledge, there is no list of attorneys who do pro bono work. You might want to call the NC Bar Association or check their website.43755.5569444444 You are correct in that you cannot file for absolute divorce until you have been separated for a year. That is the law in NC. Not every state is the same.Taking your child out of state is trickier. That's more than I can answer in this format. If you withhold your daughter from her father, or if you cross state lines for the purposes of avoiding the jurisdiction of the NC courts to resolve custody, then he could file for custody -- even emergency custody to have her returned here to his care. 43754.7923611111 Hi ###.  Whether you are eligible for an expunction will depend on several things.  Someone would need to review your entire criminal record to be able to tell for sure.  If the charges were dismissed, then it is very likely they can be expunged.  If you were convicted of one or both of the charges, you may still be eligible for some type of expunction, but there are a lot of factors.  I would recommend contacting the local legal aid office in your area.  Legal Aid locations can be found here: ###.  They will be able to assist you with the expunction.  Good luck.43746.8256944444 I'VE RECENTLY BEEN DENIED AN EXCELLENT JOB BECAUSE OF A BACKGROUND CHECK. I'M TRYING TO PREVENT THIS IN THE FUTURE.

The sooner you pay off the balance, the faster your credit score will increase, assuming you pay your recurring bills on time and above the minimum payment, and otherwise maintain good financial health.If for some reason this judgment was entered in error, you will need to hire a lawyer to help you vacate the judgment by filing the appropriate civil action to have the issue heard by a judge.  The fact that the lienholder is no longer in business might be relevant in that you have no knowledge of whom to pay in the ### absence from legal existence; however, a lawyer can help you investigate whether there is a ### or assignee who might have inherited the original ### right to be paid by you.

To better answer your question, I have some for you:Do you have a separate written agreement with your roommate?  If you do, please attach it.To your knowledge, were both of you included as a tenant on the lease agreement with the landlord?Can you also include a copy of your lease with your landlord?Have you contacted the landlord about the situation?Thanks.43744.5875 Could you forward me a copy of any addendums? It does not appear that there was an animal addendum, if that is the case, your roommate is in breach of the lease.  ###00065###. No animals (including mammals, reptiles, ###, fish, rodents, and insects) are allowed, even temporarily, anywhere in the apartment or apartment community unless weâ€™ve so authorized in writing...If you or any guest or occupant violates animal restrictions (with or without your knowledge), youâ€™ll be subject to charges, damages, eviction, and other remedies provided in this Lease Contract.

Thank you for this ### and thorough response! I was told by the people at the leasing office that she would have to sign me off and without her sign off I cannot leave. How can I get out of this toxic situation? She is telling me that I cannot leave unless I pay for the make up stain in the living room and find a roommate she approves of. If she does not sign me off I cannot leave, correct?43745.7763888889 I am currently held in a leasing contract with an abusive roommate. She does not value my security or safety and sent to me in writing that she does not have to inform me of her guests. In addition, she continues to antagonize me when I suggest boundaries for the both of us. She is hostile, and leaves a mess when future tenants wish to look at the apartment. She agrees to sign me off the lease, as long as I find another roommate she likes and approves of. This is detrimental and has worsened my mental health. Her dog always ### at me though she told me that he was not hostile. In addition, she moved in a month later than agreed, and I had to pay her portion of the rent twice. I have a fear of dogs and feel I am developing anxiety. What should I do?43742.7993055556 I was told by the leasing office nothing can be done, as any signs of discomfort cannot be proven and will only be hearsay. However, I already have another place to go that is safer for my health, how can I get out?43745.9340277778 Perfect, thank you! 43746.1111111111 She pays for the pet to be there once a month, so that would not work. She has permission for that dog. So essentially theres nothing I can do but comply with her requests.....43745.93125 Since there is NO agreement between you and your roommate, the only agreement that is controlling is the lease. Under the lease, it is the landlord, not the tenant, that has to agree to the new occupant:Please see below:###00065### AND SUBLETTING.â€ƒReplacing a resident, subletting, assignment , or granting a right or license to occupy is allowed only when we expressly consent in writing. If ### or remaining residents find a replacement resident acceptable to us before moving out and we expressly consent, in writing, to the replacement, subletting, assignment, or granting a right or any license to occupy then:(###000487) a reletting charge will not be due;(###000652) a reasonable administrative (paperwork) and/or transfer fee will be due, and a rekeying fee will be due if rekeying is requested or required; and(###) the ### and remaining residents will remain liable for all Lease Contract obligations for the rest of the original Lease Contract ###.Procedures for Replacement.â€ƒIf we approve a replacement resident, then, at our option:(###000487) the replacement resident must sign this Lease Contract with or without an increase in the total security deposit; or (###000652) the remaining and replacement residents must sign an entirely new Lease ### we agree otherwise in writing, your security deposit will automatically transfer to the replacement resident as of the date we approve. The ### resident will no longer have a right of occupancy or ### refund, but will remain liable for the remainder of the original Lease Contract ### unless we agree otherwise in ### if a new Lease Contract is signed.The lease also allows for the landlord to enter the premises when showing to prospective tenants (See, Sec. ###0006527. When We May Enter). Your current roommate would be in a bind with the landlord entering with the showing to prospective tenants, as the condition of the premises, her actions, and presence of animals could impact her ability to stay also.  You may want to share with her that if she does not work with you to find a replacement tenant, you will request having the landlord come during the showings for replacement tenants, which you are entitled to do under the lease.43745.5472222222 Submit a Move-Out Notice" effective ###.  Within the letter provide the reasons for your termination of the lease and the ineffectiveness of the landlord to provide a remedy under the lease as available.  You may reference any written communications as attachments.  State within your letter that you "give the landlord permission to enter the premises to show the premises to prospective residents upon providing a Move Out Notice in accordance with Paragraph 27 Sec. ###."  The landlord will balk at the Move-Out Notice because it terminates your lease early; however they are not providing you any recourse short of default.  I highly recommend requesting in writing that a representative from the leasing office assist you with showings for prospective residents to aid in making the transition faster."43746.0375 Thank you for your reply! No, she will not agree to any type of agreement, rules or set boundaries for us.We both signed the lease, so we are both tenants, thus she will have to sign me off in order for me to leave.I have attached it here.Yes, she says that is between me and my roommate. There is nothing they can do.43745.2208333333 Thank you! Could that leave me vulnerable to be sued due to leaving without my fellow tenant signing off on it?43746.0465277778 The landlord would have the right to pursue you for the remainder of the rent under the lease, but they have a duty to mitigate damages.  This is why I stress that you put in writing your attempts to have them assist you in following their procedures, including requesting that they assist you in the replacement tenant procedure due to the issues with your roommate. If they refuse, it is bad faith on their part.The plain language of Paragraph ###.  Contracts are construed against the drafter, and There is no claim available by your roommate.43746.0743055556 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for this very important question.  Reading your fact su###y fro###lawyer's perspective (one who has litigated a few real property disputes), I think your ### are correct.  Negligence and fraud are certainly in existence if these facts can be proven in court, and there could also be breach of fiduciary duty, although I cannot say that for certain.  I agree with you that suing the wrongdoing parties in court is a good idea, and you could also report them to the North Carolina Real Estate Commission for an investigation.  I know at least one of the ### who handle disciplinary actions against real estate agents, and I can tell you that they take these complaints seriously.Now, as to finding local counsel in or around ###ia: I recommend that you use ### Find a Lawyer" feature (it is free) in addition to contacting the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association.  You can also contact the ### County Bar and see if they can offer you referrals in real estate litigation.  You might be able to find a ### lawyer willing to take a case in ### County.I agree with your thinking on this and believe you are on the right track; now you simply need to find a lawyer who is willing and able to take this on in a payment arrangement that you both can afford to accept.  This is (mostly) freely negotiable between lawyer and client.I wish you the very best in obtaining the justice and monetary compensation that I believe you truly deserve.  God bless you and your family this fall.### A. ### ### Esq."43747.7166666667 I called the Real Estate Commission back in ###19, and the lady told me to contact a lawyer first before giving her the names of the agents bc there was such severe negligence, she didn't want to have to notify them before action could take place.43747.7263888889 My wife and I bought our home in ###17. We were told by our agent not to get an inspection. We also questioned many faulty aspects of the property and he brushed them off. The FHA minimal inspection was signed off when the repairs were never completely made. The listing is wrong including stating that the property is city water and sewer and it is not. The buyer agent forged our name on documents. The listing agent hired unlicensed professionals to make electrical repairs and submitted an ### electrical inspection of the property claiming that the electrical wiring was safe, which we have proof otherwise and spent nearly $###,###. We have found ### water damage to the property, among a number of other issues in documentation and ### issues with the property. We are having a really hard time finding a lawyer to handle the case and we are unsure of what to do. There are several parties who were aware of the ### issues in the transaction and failed to find the forged documentation (which we did not know about because we didn't see or sign the document). We know that negligence is undeniably involved, and we think there is a problem of real estate fraud. What attorney will help us in ### County?43747.6798611111 Wow!  That alone speaks to just how serious this is.  I hope the ### avenues I offered will lead to productive results.  The sooner you get a real estate litigator who can take this on, the better off you will be.  Although they might be rather expensive (I estimate around $###), you could look up ### ### and ### ### of Greensboro.  They would be perfect in terms of ### and skill set, but they also charge a lot.

You will need a personal injury attorney. Personal injury attorney's typically work on a contingency fee basis, meaning they take a percent of whatever settlement or eventual money judgment may be awarded to you.

Some days are better than others, but overall,  I'm in a much better, positive emotional place in my life. I learned my lesson well and have no intention of repeating the same errors of judgment. If you would,  please  explain that last statement in your first paragraph in a way I might better understand what it meant,  if that's possible,  I would very much appreciate it and probably feel a little more at ease about my situation.

I didn't know that my friend was being investigated for his family's drug business. I was not trafficking,  I was just using. I had never been in any trouble with the law before and haven't since that ###. I knew nothing about the law nor the trouble I was in.  I thought a public defender would take care of me. The court said if I would give them names of people in the family drug business,  they'd let me go. I didn't know anything,  so they gave me the felony.  I have always worked,  before and since this incident.  I haven't been able to get a decent paying job since, up to today. I'm wanting to work with USPS, but need to know if NC will ever remove this felony from my record. This has severely,  adversely affected my  entire life.  I am now ### $### job.

It's not looking good for me.Thank you for any advice or options that may be available to me.Sincerely,  ### ### 43748.0409722222 Unfortunately, you canâ€™t have this expunged. It sounds like you were convicted of possession with the intent to sale and distribute cocaine. While I understand that you may have only intended to use, your conviction is explicitly the type that is exempt from expunction. The law allows many ### felony conviction after ###, so long as there is no other trouble and itâ€™s not for a crime that is an exception. I am glad that you have overcome this issue (although I recognize that recovery requires a daily choice for sobriety). I do wonder if you could obtain a Certificate of Relief. This is NOT an expunction but is a process under the law where you may be able to show a judge that you have been rehabilitated and the judge gives you the certificate in an attempt to try to help you convince employers not to â€œhold it against youâ€. This can be a long process and the judge does NOT have to grant it to you (itâ€™s discretionary). More info on a Certificate of Relief may be found here:  https://www.nccourts.gov/assets/documents/forms/cr281_1.pdf?RsdFdrjl4w1Q3jvQrCkQrtUmlOfcQbAGSometimes Legal Aid of NC can help with these. I hope this information helps, and I wish you the best of luck as you continue your journey of recovery.43755.1659722222 You do not need to respond to the questions I asked in my response that I just sent you.

However, without a custody agreement, either parent can have the child. It appears that you all havenâ€™t been able to amicably work something out. At this point, you may want to consider filing for custody. I understand this can be costly. I would suggest that you start by loo### at the resources that Legal Aid of NC offers on its website. The general website is www.legalaidnc.org. Their site with the custody materials is here: http://www.legalaidnc.org/get-help/self-help-clinics/child-custody-and-visitation. Youâ€™ll need to determine the home state of the child (based on the information provided, itâ€™s unclear if the child is in NC ).They have a packet that you can download, videos, and even a clinic that you can attend for free. If you feel you child is in real imminent danger by being with dad (the fact that you arenâ€™t seeing him and may be frustrated is NOT enough), then you may want to look at emergency custody. Please take a look at Legal Aidâ€™s resources. Also, each county has â€œlocal rulesâ€ so you may have to get certain forms from your local Clerk of Court.43750.6305555556 Ms. Lay:Since we are talking about overlapping estates, it would not hurt to have a ### County (assuming that is where the stepfather and mother lived up to the time of death) probate lawyer do an initial ### to decide whether there might be a shortcut, such as a small estate" affidavit collection process to help you satisfy any outstanding claims against either or both estates and dispose of the car once the title is changed.  It is hard to say for certain what you should do from the distance of an online forum such as this one but if I were in your situation and I were not a lawyer I would seek a ### consultation with probate counsel in the appropriate county which will help you outline a game plan for resolving this ###.You should bring with you to your consultation a brief (###-###) fact su###y of each parent's death and financial situation and any relevant documents that you think your probate lawyer would be able to use in providing you the best advice for your time and money during the consultation.  It is possible that you will be able to handle everything once the consultation is over or with the benefit of a few consultations along the way as opposed to hiring a lawyer full time (although that is an option as well).Use ### "Find a Lawyer" feature to search in the appropriate North Carolina town/city under the "Probate" practice area.

First probate court said I needed proof of paying off a ### in my step father's name to be able to be executor over his estate, which I have paid off the equity loan on his house after he died.

Still in contact with the seller and I have an email that I sent the money to)43753.0458333333 Hello, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Yes, if the phone does not arrive, or if it arrives in defective condition, contrary to what the seller warranted to you, you could sue the seller in small claims court.  However, be aware that in North Carolina, the filing fee alone for small claims court is $###, and the service of process fee for the Sheriff (if you decide to serve the seller through the Sheriff) is $###.  Your initial ### therefore would be $###.  You will have to decide whether this is truly worth it since the most that you would recover fro###small claims suit would be the contract price for the phone.  Whether this is worth the effort, time and expense of litigation depends on your own value syste###d cost-benefit analysis.  But yes, this is an option if you can find a physical address associated with the defendant (work or residence, with a preference for the residence) at which you can effect service.If the seller lives outside North Carolina, you would have to sue in the county where the seller lives, and that would likely involve a lawyer helping you since you are a bit of a distance away.  That would all but likely not make that a worthwhile endeavor.Hopefully the ### period is just an incidental delay and will not last much longer.

I am sorry you have had such an unpleasant experience with this particular local government official.  Legally speaking, what you describe here is not harassment" (although I can understand your irritation over these repeated encounters) but if you feel you have been treated unfairly I would write an email or letter to the mayor or one of the other members of city council; usually elected officials are quite responsive to complaints of this kind from their constituents who they have to face in a way that ### city officials do not.  As long as the parks employee was strictly speaking enforcing city rules with respect to parks she can legally assert the defense of justification based on her lawful authority to enforce local government rules laws regulations etc. that fall within her job responsibilities in the name of the city.

God bless you and enrich your life this fall.  Be well.43752.7131944444 So her continued harrassment of me and threatening to have me arrested for not putting a very large metal tag on my very small dog and causing her injury is not considered harrassment. Did I mention she knows I am disabled. I have ### Arthritis and this park is the closest one to me I need to walk everyday or soon I will not be able to walk. Her harrassment of me has left me feeling as though I have no place that I can safely walk. I have complained and they have done nothing about it. The law states that I must be able to proove that my dogs have had their ### shots it does not state that I have to put that tag on the dogs collar. I just need to have it accessible. So she is not following the letter of the law. I  always have the ### tags with me when I walk my dogs. 43752.6368055556 Thank you for your response.  My ### still tells me that you will not succeed in any lawsuit against her or the City.  One has to show in a situation like this that you were targeted and discriminated against precisely because of your ### any other federally protected class such as race, color, national origin, religion, sex or age (if over 40).  If you could prove that this was intentional discrimination based on disability, you might have something, but that is a difficult thing to prove in a court of law.  You would be better off raising this with the Mayor and other members of the City Council.  I am sure they would at least look into this and see if they needed to intervene.  Elected officials can exert pressure on the permanent city staff since the Council determines their funding for the different local government departments.43752.6423611111 Thank you43752.7118055556 The city of Burlington parks ### a woman to insure that those using the dog park have had their pets vaccinated, she has been harrassing me since I started using the park, I filled out the forms provided proof they were vaccinated, and have been using the park for several months. About every ### she shows up on a saturday and starts harrassing me about on putting the ### tags on my little dogs collar, I do not believe that they have to be on the collar but I do have them with me at all times I keep them in my purse. She does this all the time I have complained about her harassment of me and they do nothing. They dismiss it because I am disabled. They treat me as if I were an idiot and do not have the right to be treated as an equal. This woman even told me she was calling the police on me for not putting the tag on my dogs collar, and I could not use the park. I told her I was sick of her harrassment, and that it needs to stop, she then started taking pictures and said the  police were on their way. (they never showed up) I waited. Can I sue the parks department for the constant harrassment? She is after all an employee. Please tell me I have a case. 43752.5930555556 Good Monday morning to you, Ms. ###:Thanks so much for reaching out to us on NC Free Legal Answers.

I hope you two can work something out on your traffic matter.Have a blessed fall, and I wish you many good and productive things in life.Best wishes,### A. ###inson, ###, Esq.43752.6263888889 i need an attorney to get me out of a speeding ticket in Iredell county. 43752.6138888889 I found an offer online for an iPhone ### $###.

Still, in contact with the seller and I have an email that I sent the money to)43753.0604166667 Ms. ###:You would likely need to hire a civil litigator based in ### to file the action for you, otherwise you would have to travel down there to handle your litigation, since someone who is not a lawyer doing this for you would likely run afoul of the ###'s unauthorized practice of law regulations (each state, including North Carolina, has some version of this, although strictly filing something you prepared yourself would likely not be considered the practice of law").  You would need to briefly research the requirements for small claims lawsuits in the county where ### is located the fill out a complaint and summons per ###'s rules of civil procedure.  Filing fees and service of process fees would apply so you would need to ask the courthouse officials down there (###) what forms you need and (###) what you need to pay (and by what method).  Keep in mind too that it will be difficult to win if you do not show up down there in person when your case is to be heard before the judge or magistrate in small claims court.  Essentially it is a matter of finding out what ###'s small claims court requires then filing your paperwork properly and preparing for your court date.The question that any lawyer in ### will ask is why you are willing to spend in filing and service of process fees (and legal fees should you hire local ### counsel) that will likely match if not quite exceed the amount that you could hope to recover in the action.  I think you would do barely better than merely breaking even based on what I know of the situation.  You are not likely to receive much in the way of awarded damages and remember that even if you win you still have to execute your civil judgment against the defendant's assets which is another process in and of itself.  You have the right to sue but I do not think this worth your while given the small amount of money at issue.Best wishes in whatever you decide.  Be well.### A. ### ### Esq."43753.06875 On ### I was pulled over and given a ticket for driving on a suspended license. I recently became a resident of NC. My previous residence was in MD.

Could I get jail time? 43753.0965277778 The North Carolina courts will take into account your prior charge of ###. The possibility of jail time depends on the reason why your license was revoked, the seriousness of the offense, your past driving record, amongst other things. The penalties for this offense could include a monetary fine, as well as jail time. You may be eligible for a pubic defender depending on your income, and if the offense that you are charged with carries a penalty of jail time, among other factors. If this is the case, a public defender will be appointed to you in court. I recommend that you speak with an attorney.43763.7486111111 What are the penalties for this violation? Would I be able to get a public defender? I am not able to apply for a license due to child support. 43753.1118055556 Hello, I am a ### college student originally from South Carolina.

She said she would watch the child for a week (since I paid for it already) and then after that I would have to find another daycare.43753.78125 Ms. ###:Technically you could take this to small claims court, but the filing fee alone in North Carolina for small claims lawsuits is $###, and the service of process fee through the Sheriff is $###.  So you would have to pay $###.### $###, and whether you would be awarded your legal costs will depend on the magistrate.  The fact that the contract was unsigned is of little matter, since it can be easily inferred from the conduct of the two parties that there was some agreement of a kind, even if verbal, and that the same more likely than not ### to the written version that the two sides had contemplated when this discussion began.  (Essentially, both sides ### the written agreement by conduct, if not by signature.)  You can likely report this person to the NC Department of Health and Human Services (I believe this agency is the one that regulates daycares, but double-check me on that one, online), but they cannot compel her to refund her the $###.  If she is willing to keep your child for another week, you may just wish to avail yourself of that benefit, then end the business relationship at the end of the final week paid for, without any further demand for refunds.  This is totally up to you.  However, given the small amount of money at issue here, I do not see any kind of ### small claims ### doing based on the facts you stated.I regret that you and the childcare provider had this disagreement.

First, I would run this by your own insurance provider and see what helpful guidance they can provide.  They may be willing to contact the other driver's insurer and personally work things out.  If your insurance co###y will not hire legal counsel for any outstanding disputes that cannot otherwise be settled, you should hire a personal injury lawyer to assist you with pursuing damages against the other driver.  Many personal injury lawyers offer free consultations, and most of them work on contingency, so you would pay either little or nothing upfront.  You would want to reach someone reputable either in the county where the accident happened, or where the defendant lives and can be served with legal process.  Consulting with your insurer and (if necessary) legal counsel will likely reveal more.I hope you make it through this restored and well, and I wish you the best in your academic and career pursuits.Blessings and be well,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43753.9638888889 I was in a car accident two weeks ago the girl hit me from behind in a one lane road in her car insurance company is saying theyâ€™re not going to pay for the damages on my car I need the car to go to school which I am attending till December to get my license in the field my car is undrivable at the moment what are the laws and ### and County can I sue this insurance company Iâ€™m not sure what to do43753.8597222222 In order to determine how much child support a parent owes to the child, the courts may consider all forms of income received by the paying parent. Veterans Administration benefits and Social Security benefits received for the benefit of a child as a result of the disability or retirement of either parent are considered to be income.

Your child support order can by enforced by the state through wage withholding, tax refund offsets, liens, professional ### revocation, credit reporting, court action, or other collection remedies. You can fill out an application through North Carolina Child Support Services: ### which is a state organization responsible for helping collect child support.

Any mention of case l### in Florida, or any Florida l### for that matter, is simply for illustrative purposes only.  A great l### student from ### School of L### performed all of the research in this question and drafted the response.  I reviewed her draft and I ### with her analysis. The short answer is that It is unlikely that you can successfully apply for a concealed carry permit unless granted clemency for the misdemeanor battery adjudication withheld in Florida. Analysis In North Carolina, â€œ[t]he sheriff can shall deny a [concealed carry] permit to an applicant who. . . is or has been adjudicated guilty of or received a ### for judgment continued or suspended sentence for one or more crimes of violence constituting a misdemeanor.â€ [###] The statute does not address adjudication withheld because North Carolina does not recognize adjudication withheld as a sentence. In Florida, â€œ[### allowed by l###, the judge may withhold an adjudication of guilt if the judge places the defendant on probation.â€ [###] This seems very similar to a ### for Judgment Continued, where the defendant is found guilty or must plead guilty but no finding of guilt is entered into the record.[###] Based on the ### and the ### intent to include PJCs within the scope of the statute, as well as North ### lack of recognition of adjudication withheld, it seems likely that the sheriffâ€™s decision not to grant a concealed carry permit to the client will stand.The best chance to get you a permit to carry concealed could be to make an argument that a withhold of adjudication looks similar to a formal deferred prosecution agreement. ### are not covered by the concealed carry legislation. Neither require convictions and both impose sentences of probation, the completion of which will allow the case to be dismissed in the instance of a DPA and no collateral consequences in the case of adjudication withheld in FL.[###] The problem with this is that adjudication withheld comes after a finding or pleading of guilt. No admission of guilt is required for a DPA. Because NC courts have begun to hold that a guilty verdict, not entry of judgment, is the ### of a conviction, this is unlikely to work.[5] Furthermore, misdemeanors related to domestic violence and assault on a female are covered by the concealed carry legislation as a reason to deny a permit. Also, expungement is not an option in either North Carolina or Florida, as neither states allow battery misdemeanors to be expunged (even if they resulted in PJCs or a withhold of adjudication). [6] [7].Also, it is important to note that just because you were able to obtain his pistol permit, this does not mean that you will also be granted a concealed carry permit. North Carolina has established that the right to own a firearm preserved in the Second Amendment does not transfer or cover the right to conceal carry a firearm. [8][###] N.C. ###. Stat.

This is a troubling situation.  A lawyer would need to read your contract and better understand the nature of this transaction before providing any definite legal advice; the type of lawyer with whom you would want to consult on this issue would be a lawyer who practices in the areas of contracts, commercial law, intellectual property and/or business law (noting of course that many lawyers would overlap in these areas depending on the degree of specialization of their overall law practice).  If the lawyer who consults with you determines that you have standing to pursue a lawsuit against this individual, you would need to determine whether you can sue in Colorado (likely), ###, D.C. (likely), or North Carolina (maybe, but not the best option, unless the contract specifically states that conflict resolution can be brought in North Carolina, or the individual has substantial contacts with the State of North Carolina as to justify personal jurisdiction over such an out-of-state defendant).  Legal counsel in whatever jurisdiction is most appropriate and proper for litigation can advise on next steps towards seeking justice and recourse in your situation.### Find a Lawyer" feature is a useful (and free) resource for researching lawyers as well as the state bar associations (or D.C. Bar Association) in which you might contemplate a lawsuit.

It depends entirely on what your proven injuries are, and what medical treatment would be needed to treat the same.  If you have not had any serious symptoms and your consulting doctor concludes that you are fine, no compensation at all.  I suspect this case will not be worth much unless you really suffered from the incident.  A personal injury lawyer, in a consultation, would want to see your doctor's notes and medical records relating to your hospital visit.  It is from those documents that a personal injury lawyer would know what a case is worth.  It is impossible to say right now what that dollar amount would be, but it is probably very low.43759.6673611111 Thank you for your feedback.

I strongly recommend that you find a civil rights firm in ###, ###, or elsewhere within a driving distance of ### County, and ask for an initial consultation on this matter; it will take a personal discussion with a civil rights lawyer familiar with ### rights cases to fully determine whether you might have a case against the State of North Carolina.

I have done my own research and have concluded that ### is known to cause false positives for THC. I am having to undergo a ###, substance abuse program, and my command has started the process of separating me from the army. I was told by my command that I needed to get more documentation from my doctor that states I was under her care when I received the prescription, what it was prescribed for, and the fact that it can cause false positives. When I contacted the doctor's office, I was met very rudely by the receptionist who tried to lie and say it did not cause false positives. A simple Google search proved that to be false. When I informed her of this I was basically told to go screw myself. My career is on the line due to this particular doctor's negligence in properly researching medication before prescribing it. She knew I was military BEFORE she wrote the prescription. I want to find a way to hold her accountable for not only hindering my career currently, but also in the future as well, as this positive test will now follow me the rest of my military days. That record alone is a defamation of my character, will hinder further promotions, schooling, or awards I may have received in the future, and has caused me to have to undergo a substance abuse program and be treated like a drug addict by my command. Any help would be greatly appreciated. As it stands now, I have no idea where to go with this. It has affected my family in ways I cannot describe, my health has suffered for this, and now is affecting my family's finances as my husband has to take off work. 43761.6430555556 You have two issues.  First is with the military tribunal and most important.  Do you have a ### representing you?  Military ### are very different from civil court and abide by a different set of rules.  It may be that if your doctor is unwilling to testify, it could be enough evidence that you have a copy of the prescription, which was filled, and another doctor familiar with ###, or better yet a pharmacist, could testify that, according to their experience, may cause false positives.  Talk to your ###, they will know what to do best.  Second, it seems you want to pursue a medical malpractice lawsuit.  A medical malpractice suit is an action against a doctor or other healthcare provider for money based on the claim that they breached their duty of care as a healthcare provider and, as a result, you were damaged.  Usually the damage is physical, but here youâ€™re claiming career damage.  North Carolina is not overly favorable to medical malpractice plaintiffs (those are people that file lawsuits).  The state law offers strong protection to healthcare providers and caps monetary recovery for noneconomic damages, which is what you would be seeking unless you could demonstrate lost wages with strong clarity.You could consult with plaintiff attorneys that specialize in medical malpractice to see if they would represent you.  If a plaintiff attorney accepts your case and agrees to represent you, their fee would be 33% of whatever monetary damage you were awarded.  Representing yourself would be very difficult as medical malpractice cases are often complicated.  Search online for medical malpractice attorneys and ask friends and family for recommendations for medical malpractice lawyers.I caution that it may be difficult to find an attorney to represent you in this case.  Medical malpractice cases typically involve physical harm.  Also it is difficult to prove a loss of future wages or career ### because it necessarily involves ### into the future.  Also, the doctor, even if she knew you were military, may have, in her judgment as a healthcare professional, believed ### was the best treatment for you.  It is difficult to prove medical negligence in that and many situations.Best of luck - do everything you can to speak to a ###.  In answering this question, please note I have not agreed to represent you or pursue any claim on your behalf.  I have provided an answer to your posted question, for your reference, and consider the matter closed.  Thank you.43761.8694444444 Good evening, ###:Good question.  Attorney-client privilege is ### for the client's protection, not the attorney's, and is designed to protect the former, but not necessarily the latter (just as you described in your post).  The board member could have lawfully provided that information to the public on behalf of the town if he chose to, but it was also entirely appropriate for the attorney to warn the client about the sensitive nature of the information to be shared.  If the client overruled counsel, that would be legal, but may not necessarily be wise, prudent or advisable.  It really depends on what was being discussed.  If it pertained to a litigation matter, I would advise my client in that situation not to speak to any details of the litigation without conferring with me first.  It is appropriate for public boards to divulge some information in order to meet the public's need for information that pertains to their well being as local residents and taxpayers, but disclosures should still have prudential limits by board members, if not necessarily legal or ethical ones.Good question, nonetheless.  Have a blessed and productive fall and winter.43763.1083333333 i believe I understand attorney client privilege.If I say something to my attorney he may not share my statements or information with others unless I give permission. Is this correct?My question is, does this also work in reverse?  Is a client also prevented from sharing what was discussed while interacting with the attorney?During a public meeting one of the board members began sharing some information regarding an ongoing legal matter between the organization represented by the board and a local town. Note- the firm represents the board as well as a town currently suing the organization represented by the board. The immediate issue had been discussed during a closed session attended by the board as well as the boards attorney. The attorney shut the board member down, citing â€œAttorney Client Privilegeâ€.  The only one protected by ### the board member seemed to be the law firm. The board member was choosing to share information. Does this actually fall under attorney client confidentiality, or was the attorney full of ...?Thank you,###43763.05625 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  Generally, a full su###y ejectment process in North Carolina takes between two and four weeks, depending on a few factors.  Here below is a general description of how the process works:The tenant defaults on rent and is often given a five-day grace period (not required by law, but a standard period in many NC residential leases).  After the grace period ends, the landlord sends a final demand for payment of all outstanding rent and late fees, on peril of the landlord filing a small claims lawsuit for su###y ejectment.  Normally this final demand must be paid within ten (10) days.  On the eleventh (###) day, if the demand has not been fully satisfied, the landlord files a lawsuit in small claims court, and a hearing date is scheduled in front of magistrate within ten (10) to fourteen (14) days.  On the date of hearing, both sides appear and present their arguments, and if the facts are clear that the tenant has defaulted, the magistrate will enter an order of eviction in the landlord's favor.  The tenant would then have ten (10) calendar days to appeal.  If the tenant either does not appeal, or appeals but loses on appeal, the landlord may then go to the Sheriff for a Writ of Possession.  Notice of the Writ will be posted to the tenant's door, and be executed upon within three to five days.  At that point, the landlord and deputy sheriff will appear together at the residence, padlock the door, and if necessary remove the tenant by force.  The landlord may then remove the tenant's personal property in order to ready the unit for a subsequent tenant.All of this, from beginning to finish, usually happens just within a month's time, although it can be a little quicker or slower depending on the situation, and also how busy the small claims court magistrate's docket is during any given month.Note that if the tenant shows up in court at the last minute and is able, at any time before entry of final judgment, pay all outstanding rent/fees to the landlord, plus the court costs, the magistrate is statutorily required to dismiss the lawsuit altogether, and the possessory rights of the tenant are reinstated as normal under the current lease.  I hope this gives you an helpful overview of the process, at least in general terms.  No two situations are exactly alike, however.If this is your situation as a tenant, I hope that something will break for you soon so that you do not have to deal with being evicted and having a civil judgment entered on your record.  If you are the landlord, I hope that you will not be unduly inconvenienced.  Either way, I wish the very best for you and all in your circle who might be affected by this situation.Have a blessed fall and winter,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43766.7743055556 how long does it take to have someone evicted from their residence43763.675 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you so much for raising this very important question about your son; my goodness, what a trial he has been through.  While a lawyer cannot say definitively from reading this fact su###y that the hospital did anything negligent or intentional to cause your son an injury, these facts are credible enough that it is totally appropriate for you to consult with a medical malpractice lawyer to vet a potential clai###ainst the hospital and treating physician.  Many if not all medical malpractice lawyers offer free or low-cost consultations for around ###, so please seriously consider this; it is well worth your time and investment.  Gather all your son's pertinent medical records into an organized ###, and after you do a little online searching, reach out to a lawyer for an initial consultation on this matter.### Find a Lawyer" feature is a good research tool and contacting the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association is also a good idea.  If ### is not too far for you I recommend my ### colleagues Guy ### and ### ### (google the###d you will see their firm information; if you contact them let them know that I referred them to you).I hope you can soon get connected with a lawyer who can provide you with the candid legal ### the medical records and any ensuing ### you need to make an informed decision as to your son's case.

He was maybe ### 18th birthday we find out his elbow has still been broken all this time. He just had to have surgery on the 15th of this month for his elbow. Now when he broke his arm and they put the cast on they didn't tell me that it was still broken after removing the cast. So is the hospital  liable for this and if not who is liable for him having a broken elbow for all this time?43763.7916666667 Hello, Ms. ###:Thanks for your question.  I am sorry you got hurt at your residence.  While it would take a personal injury lawyer's close examination of the situation in order to determine the correct answer for certain, I will note on a preliminary basis that if the hole was easily apparent and ###, it is likely that the apartment complex will not be liable.  In order to have a good suit or clai###ainst the complex, you would need to show that the property was negligent in its maintenance of the common areas of the property (or ### of your home if the injury happens inside the rented space), and that the negligent maintenance was both the legal and factual cause of your injury.  You must also show, in a situation like this, that you did not act unreasonably, especially if the hole was in a conspicuous space where residents could have easily noticed its existence.  Lastly, even if the property should have maintained the parking lot better, the question of how long they had notice of the problem is relevant, since the standard for breach of care in negligence actions is whether the defendant (apartment complex, in this situation) acted reasonably under the circumstances."  If the property either was not notified; or if the maintenance crew had not yet discovered the hole due to a recent ### of the hole; or if the property knew about the hole but had not yet had a reasonable time to hire someone to come over and fix it the property will most likely not be held to have been negligent or to have acted unreasonably.  (Also note that if there were any cones or warning signs near the whole that would tend towards the property's benefit.)This is what I see as the principal aspects of this matter fro###preliminary standpoint and also based on limited awareness of the situation on the ground.  A personal injury lawyer during an initial consultation on this matter can go a little deeper and examine the photos facts and your medical records with you in person to determine whether you have a claim and if so what your claim would be worth.  Many personal injury lawyers offer either free or low-cost consultations so this would be worth your while if you believe that the property could have avoided this but failed to do so due to laziness or negligence.Use ### "Find a Lawyer" feature or call the ### County Bar for a referral in personal injury law if desired.  Also keep in mind the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association.

Your post is a little hard to follow, but I will answer this as best I can.  If you have a lease agreement for a fixed amount of time (such as three months, six months, a year, etc.), and the lease is not over yet, the landlord may not evict you based on a demand by you as the tenant (which you are completely entitled to make) for the landlord to adequately repair defective aspects of your rented premises.  If the landlord actually sues you based on this you can counterclaim against the landlord for retaliatory eviction which is illegal in North Carolina.  Retaliatory eviction is a defense rather than claim, so the only time you can raise it is when the landlord has actually filed a lawsuit for eviction based on improper, retaliatory grounds.The lines get a little more blurry, legally speaking, if you and the landlord have an informal verbal agreement on a month-to-month or week-to-week basis.  If that is so, and there is no set lease ### in writing, all the landlord need do is provide you with seven days' notice (if month-to-month) or two days (if week-to-week) to ###inate the tenancy.  Since either landlord or tenant can ###inate a periodic tenancy whenever each wishes to (assuming the proper notice in advance is furnished orally or in writing, per N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-14), there is much less of ground from which to assert retaliatory eviction; the landlord in a periodic tenancy can simply ###inate with proper notice for any reason, or no reason at all stated.So whether you can ultimately challenge and prevail over the landlord for this conduct depends largely on whether you have a written lease for a set ###; if so, keep paying your rent as usual and do not breach the lease in any way that the landlord can legitimately sue you for violating the lease in any material way.  If not, it is more likely than not that the landlord will prevail if you challenge his actions.This is the best I can offer based on my reading of your post.  I hope all turns out well for you, for your peace of mind.  Be well.43766.8819444444 Landlord evicted me due to asking to have the floor put back down after her tore it up ### left it open for ### ### ###'m disable can u pls give me some sort of understanding how he can do this 43766.8180555556 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thanks so much for this interesting question; I have been working on easement issues (for sewer, specifically) for the past few days, so your question ### out at me immediately.

This is not something one single person can do just because s/he wishes to do so.In North Carolina, here are the following reasons an easement can be terminated (none of which seem to apply to your situation since only one person wants to terminate):(###) Written, express release by the owner of the dominant tract (you);(###) Cessation of the original purpose for which the easement was granted;(###) Abandonment of the easement by the dominant tenant (you);(###) Merger of the dominant tract (yours) and the ### tract (your neighbor's) into one consolidated real estate parcel;(5) ### by adverse possession;(6) Expiration of a set period of time (if such a period was specified in the original easement language);(7) Transfer of the ### tract (your neighbor's) to a subsequent purchaser for ### ONLY if the easement itself had not been recorded with the Register prior to the transfer for value (due to the ### purchaser not knowing ahead of time, and having no way of knowing that the easement had existed, since it was never publicly recorded); or(8) Eminent domain/conde###ion by a local, state or federal government entity.While I am not intimately familiar with this situation, it does not appear that this in any way falls under any of the eight circumstances, nor does it appear that the easement was given to your predecessor(s) in title to your property with contingent ###.  Based on what limited information I have, I do not believe your neighbor will succeed in her expressed ###.

Until or unless actual charges have been filed against you, there is little you can do, except retain a local criminal defense lawyer to counsel you on how to talk (and not to talk) to police while the investigation is still pending.  It would be ideal for your to have legal counsel present for any future discussions you have with law enforcement on this matter.  It is very possible that in the course of the investigation, the officers involved will determine either that there is insufficient evidence to charge you, or that no charges are warranted in the slightest, at all.  It really depends on what is uncovered.  For now it appears that you are fine, but you really should have a criminal defense lawyer retained so that s/he can be available to deal with any sudden changes in the situation.  If you have any reason to believe that the officers might find something damning, you can confide this honestly to your retained lawyer, since the communication would be protected by lawyer-client privilege.  This applies even to consultation discussions, regardless of whether you retain that lawyer long-term.For now, be very careful about what you say to the police, as any comment you make can and likely will be used against you.  Speak with a local criminal defense lawyer in town as soon as you possibly can.  I hope you have a blessed and productive fall and winter in ### County.Best regards.43767.8909722222 Hello, Mr. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  It sounds like you might have good grounds to appeal your case into District Court and receive a larger amount, although a local litigation lawyer would need to confirm this by examining your evidence.  However, lawyers will not reach out to you first (on this website or any others), since there are strict ethics rules about lawyers directly soliciting business from new clients (we may directly solicit only in cases involving past clients and close family members, per the NC Rules of Professional Conduct).  Therefore, even if you have a good case, you will need to make the first actual contact with a lawyer, hopefully between now and Friday, in order to ensure a timely appeal, as you noted, within the ten (10) days.Several ### can help you quickly find counsel: you can use ### Find a Lawyer" feature and search locally for civil litigation lawyers and can also contact the Buncombe County Bar and Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association.  These tools can help you ### search for counsel make some initial contacts and gauge ### before close of business on this Friday.You might also reach out to ### ### of Waynesville and see if he has any interest in helping you.

A lawyer needs precise facts to analyze in order to determine whether the landlord is violating the NC Landlord-Tenant Act.  In any event, North Carolina does not allow a tenant to unilaterally withhold rent without a court order.  So if you and the landlord are not able to come to a settlement of your disagreement(s), keep paying the rent until this matter is resolved, so that you do not accidentally create liability for yourself.Feel free to add a little more detail about the landlord's actions if you want further guidance on whether your eviction is illegal.

The search warrant has to state with specific particularity what and where the search will occur, and if the officers are aware beforehand that this is a ###, they will need to state for the judge or magistrate approving the probable cause warrant which rooms would be searched.  The common areas (hallways, foyer, etc.) would be fair game, and the only way all eight rooms could be searched is if there was probable cause to believe that all eight boarders in the house are involved in the illegal activities.  The key thing for you would be to not be in the room of the boarder who is involved in these illegalities, and also not to be loitering around the common areas with people who are participating with that person.  Avoiding being in the wrong place at the wrong time with these people will likely keep you clear of the authorities, although of course nothing is guaranteed, since the officers have to make discretionary decisions sometimes based on what they see when they try to execute the warrant, or if they conduct a warrantless search based on probable cause.I would report this activity to law enforcement and the owner/landlord of the ### in order to try to preempt any issues like this ahead of time.

A lawyer would have to know a lot more about the business you wish to operate before giving precise, targeted legal advice to you about what entity to incorporate under; this is a broad question that actually requires in-person and detailed consultation with legal counsel before getting this right.  Generally, LLCs are an attractive option to folks who wish to run a relatively small and simple operation, although if there is a need for capitalization and investment, there could be benefits to incorporating as a domestic corporation.  Corporations require more formalities and organizational structure (such as a board of directors, with regular meetings, and also shareholder annual meetings) than do LLCs, but LLCs can be more vulnerable to what is called piercing the corporate ###" if they are not properly managed as genuine corporate entities and this can jeopardize the ### personal assets.  Certain steps like adopting a proper written operating agreement drafted by legal counsel (in ### law) and segregating personal and company accounts can help strengthen your limited liability protection and increase the likelihood that the LLC will protect you in the way you hope it will when you incorporate it with the state.  But this is just the beginning of your discussion with legal counsel to get this off the ground in the right way.Personally I do not recommend that low-income persons start either an incorporated enterprise for profit (LLC corporation) or a nonprofit corporation since the startup costs of doing this right are simply too high for such a person to afford.  I have seen quite a few people start incorporated enterprises with little or no money and I have never seen a single one that ended well.  All of my successful clients who have done either or both for-profit and nonprofit entities have had adequate means to hire lawyers accountants and other professionals to help manage the enterprise successfully.I am not aware of any waivers for incorporation fees for nonprofits LLCs or corporations.  The state depends on these fees for revenue so I doubt it would waive any of these.  You can always call the NC Secretary of State and ask however just to be sure.There might be instances in which multiple non-profits were linked in some way but doing this is going to require very experienced corporation lawyers and ### who would be expensive for someone without money to invest upfront.Sorry that I could not be more encouraging in my response but having helped advise or incorporate dozens of enterprises I have come to recognize distinct patterns as to what makes enterprises successful or not and I am convinced that money and professional services are absolutely essential if you hope to achieve your goals.Best wishes to you and I hope that at some time in the future you will have the resources to pursue your dreams and vision which I wholeheartedly encourage you to do.  Regardless of whether the present is the right time to begin I definitely would encourage you not to give up.

If your agreement with the Franchise allows for you to sue for capital contributions you made, you have three years from the date of breach, which, based only on what you wrote here, I assume to be November of 2017.  If that assumption is correct, you have until whatever date in November of ###-year period in which to file your lawsuit.  The legal authority for this answer is N.C.G.S.

Other claims might apply, including an equitable claim of unjust enrichment, but a lawyer would need to consult with your further on this before opining with any certainty.This would likely be an expensive case to pursue, so keep in mind that while some lawyers might be willing to take this on a ### basis, most are going to prefer either an hourly retainer of anywhere between $### $###, or at least $5,###, with a percentage to come at the end (such as a settlement, summary judgment, default judgment or jury award).

Yes, the information you heard is correct: under Chapter 7A of the North Carolina General Statutes, small claims courts are limited in their subject matter jurisdiction, and magistrates in those cases cannot hear a case if the defendant does not live or do business (if it is a corporate entity rather than a natural person) in the county where the plaintiff files; when that happens, the magistrate has no choice but to immediately dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction.This means that you can only sue the defendant in ###, unless she comes back to North Carolina.  You can hire a lawyer in ### to handle the matter if you know in what county there your roommate resides, but in order to do that, you need to analyze whether the ### is justified by what you hope to gain.  This depends on the money at issue, whether ### law allows you to recover attorney's fees in small claims cases, and also your own values.Wishing the best to you this winter.43773.7701388889 Good morning, Ms. Cook:Thank you for your question.  The only person who can lawfully require your exiting from your grandmother's house is your grandmother, or your grandmother's court-appointed guardian or agent under a power of attorney (the latter assuming your grandmother is mentally incompetent and the instrument authorizes real property transactions).  It is not so much who pays property taxes, but who actually owns the property, that matters.  Whoever owns the house you live in has the ultimate decision on whether you stay, how long you stay, and on what terms you stay.  I am not quite sure why the second cousins believe they have a right to eject you.Without knowing more about this situation, that is all I can offer at the moment.  Best wishes to you.43774.6881944444 I have a set of second cousins. Their father, my great uncle, owns the land. The house I live in, with my grandmother, is owned by my grandmother. She allowed me to move in and live with her when I lost my job in 2015. My second cousins are claiming they own the land and they have told me that they want me to leave in ###. I checked with the local land records and neither of them are shown to either own the land or pay the taxes. Can they legally tell me to leave the property? One has stated that she wants all of us gone, and that she's doing it because she hates us. She also claims that she can have my grandmother put into a facility.43774.2326388889 So far, this does not sound legitimate; people do not make such arrangements by contract"; they do so by trusts or power of attorney.  I would not worry about this until you actually see the documents and go from there.  It is likely that this is either a hard bluff or it is something that they might try but will fail at if they try to get a judge or magistrate to take this seriously.  I see no cause for alarm at least not legally speaking at the moment.  They either do not know what they are doing or they know but hope that you do not know.  Cannot tell which is which."43775.9402777778 They claim they have a contract that says only my grandmother and my now deceased grandfather are allowed to live in the house.

They say it also claims that if my grandmother leaves the house for longer than ###, they can take possession of the house and all the buildings. It was supposedly signed by my grandparents and my Uncle ###. My grandmother denies ever seeing or signing the contract, but she has dementia.The letter my mother received by certified mail states that because their supposed contract says only my grandparents can live here, I must move and take all my possessions. Their letter to my mother claims that my mother isn't keeping her property maintained, and that we both have harassed and threatened them. None of which is true. My grandmother has never been declared either competent or incompetent, as APS informed us that an incompetency hearing would require us to get permission from my mother's siblings for her to take over as guardian. And one of her sisters uses my grandmother as a bank account.Thank you for your assistance.43775.9201388889 After reporting my injury and being seen by a doctor, I was referred to a an orthopedic surgeon.  However, the Utilization Review Board denied the referral. I appealed the decision and the medical staff scrambled to get the appointment scheduled which they did, only for custody to not transport me to Central Prison in ###.  I was released shortly thereafter and am left disabled and disfigured.The injury is a torn left bicep tendon which is easily diagnosed, repaired and rehabilitated to normal function.  However, it is time sensitive and the lack of ANY medical advice and treatment has exacerbated the injury, ### surgery and subsequent rehabilitation.I'm in the process of filing for disability but it is an arduous and time consuming process that leaves me struggling financially.  Being disfigured is something I still haven't processed and hope that a comprehensive approach can be taken to any and all ###.It was the medical staff of the DPS that suggested I sue and instructed me as to what needed to be done, documented, etc.  I have requested my medical records and retained copies of correspondence with medical staff and custodial procedures such as grievances.Where do I go from here?43775.7625 Good afternoon, Mr. Field:Thank you very much for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  This is a terrible ordeal that you have been through, and even as an inmate, you did not deserve this in my opinion.  Even people who are serving time for offenses for which they have been duly convicted deserve to be treated ###.  This situation merits a closer inspection by a civil rights lawyer who handles prisoners' rights cases.I would contact the firm of ###, ### & ###, P.A., of ###; they are among the most reputable civil rights firms in North Carolina, and if they cannot take your case, I am sure they know civil rights colleagues in the prisoners' rights area who could speak with you further about whether you have grounds for a lawsuit against the State.I hope you soon obtain the preliminary guidance you need, and if appropriate, resourceful advocacy counsel for a lawsuit against the State.  I wish you all the best this winter as you heal, ###, transition to life outside the correctional system, and otherwise move forward with your life.  Blessings and best wishes to you.43775.7736111111 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Yes, if you are subpoenaed and were notified thus by the Sheriff, you are obligated to attend the court session; while it is not guaranteed that the judge will hold you in contempt if you do not show up, please know that that is entirely possible, since subpoenas are lawful court orders.  The prosecutor will decide whether to call you to the witness stand, assuming you are the State's witness, so I would try to speak with the assistant DA assigned to your case (usually this person is indicated in a written subpoena, but if you got only a ### warrant, you might call the courthouse and find out which DA works on this particular case, and share whatever concerns you have with that assistant DA.  Best wishes to you this winter.43776.6284722222 I was a victim of a domestic violence incident back in ###. My mother is still with him. I filed a police report & went to the Magistates office. The Sheriffs office called, I was subpoenaed to court as a witness. Is it mandatory I go? Will I will called to the stand? How can I drop this case? 43776.5388888889 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  The answer depends on a number of things, but generally speaking, I would say that you are entitled to a full refund.  This assumes that the lawyer has performed no actual work on your case.  Look to your ### agreement (assuming you and counsel signed one in writing), and see what it precisely says about the type of retainer that was paid.  If the retainer was an advance ### that went into the lawyer's trust account, the lawyer must refund the unused portions of the retainer and deduct only what was earned.  If the retainer was a flat-fee retainer for access to the lawyer's time, that is probably not refundable.  Much of the analysis will depend what the terms of representation were, so pay close attention to those factors.  You have the right to clarity on all terms like this, so speak candidly with your lawyer if anything is unclear.I hope all goes well as to both the legal fee inquiry and your overall legal matter.

You will need to work this out with your attorney by discussing the matter further.  I hope the conversation goes well and ### productive results.43781.8416666667 ###,I'm sorry to hear about your accident. It will depend on a number of factors beyond just your outstanding bills. When did the accident occur? Did you go to the hospital? Who caused the accident? If you are in a decent position, the insurance company will likely make you a settlement offer. Have they, and if so, how much?Keep in min personal injury attorneys are on a contingent basis by and large. Meaning they only are paid based on the settlement amount. I would be happy to provide reputable referrals. ###43782.7423611111 I have an auto accident claim my doctor bills or about $10,### ###,###43782.7347222222 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for this very important question.  Except for the confusion around dates to which you refer in your posting, it appears that everything you heard from the legal aid office and the opposing lawyer is correct.  Here are some general points of information you should know for situations similar to yours:First, if the creditor felt that the length of default and indebtedness came to the tipping point of actually having to sue you on the debt, yes, the creditor will generally not settle with you right after a complaint is filed and a civil summons is issued, although that opportunity might present itself during the mediation process (if in Superior Court), or arbitration process (if in District Court), which is when parties are required to talk to one ### briefly at ### arrive at an expeditious resolution (i.e., settlement) of differences and positions.  Generally, the only acceptable offer a creditor in this situation will entertain is that in which the debtor signs and ### a written Confession of Judgment, and a settlement agreement that includes a monthly payment plan.  The Confession of Judgment, which works the same way as an official court judgment against you, is held in trust by the creditor's lawyer and is not filed with the ### County Clerk of Superior Court if the debtor makes timely payments and otherwise ### by the terms of the settlement agreement.  If that fails and the debtor defaults, the creditor's lawyer can then file and docket the judgment, and then serve a Notice to Claim Exempt Property" form on you through the Sheriff's Office.  At such time you would have twenty (20) days to file any exemptions applicable under N.C.G.S. Chapter ### which in your case would include virtually all of your tangible personal property and up to $######.  Chances are with the exception of some small sums in your bank accounts none of your property would be seized by the Sheriff but the judgment would be good for ten (10) years subject to renewal for a second ten (10) years for a total of twenty (20) years.  Your credit would be ruined for the entire time in which the judgment goes unpaid and even for seven years after it finally is paid.  So getting a payment plan secured under a settlement agreement that includes a Confession of Judgment is likely your best option although I admit it is not in absolute terms an altogether desirable one.Hope this helps somewhat.  At the very least you need to address the allegations in the Complaint in a responsive pleading such as an Answer in which you admit deny or partially admit and partially deny each and every factual allegation of each and every enumerated paragraph of the Complaint.  Follow the format of the Complaint very carefully and in your own ### for Relief Clause at the end of the Answer (again see the Complaint for guidance on formatting and style since the Complaint and Answer follow the same format in North Carolina courts) note what relief you are seeking from the court and whether you are specifically asking the court to deny the types of relief "prayed" for in the plaintiff's Complaint.  You have thirty (###0) days to file an Answer with the Clerk of Superior Court although you can request and will automatically be granted an extension of an additional thirty (###0) days if you file a Motion to Extend Time within your initial deadline window.  Failure to file an Answer Motion to Dismiss or Motion to Extend Time within thirty (###0) days will result in an Entry of Default and Default Judgment in favor of the plaintiff.  Anything you file with the Clerk must be either mailed or hand delivered to the plaintiff's attorney under Rule ### along with a Certificate of Service that identifies the document being served the date on which service is effectuated and the ### to whom it is served and the method by which it is served (i.e. first-class mail or hand delivery).  See the requirements of Rule ###:###Also see here Rule ### (if you plan to file one) at the link below:###Hope this information is helpful to you in some way.

God bless you this winter and Thanksgiving."43783.0076388889 I received a civil summons from a law firm, for credit card debt that is legitimately mine. I don't know how to respond to the papers or to the lawyer representing the credit card company, whom I spoke to today.The legal aid office I called sent me really complicated instructions for responding to the summons and agreeing to everything, basically assuming there will be a judgment and the sheriff will come take my things. The man representing the credit card seemed to suggest I misunderstood something about the deadline, but he was very clear about not answering my questions because that would be legal advice (and obviously he represents them). He said settlement is not an option at this time, an offer of monthly payments IS an option at this time. He told me to contact him by email and make an offer. After a long period of unemployment, I'm currently in a ### part-time university teaching position that ends in December, so my finances are severely limited and I don't know what I'm going to do in January. I don't own property, my car is ###--I have only old used stuff. I seriously don't have anything worth the trouble of taking. I live in a horrible situation right now where I'm threatened with being thrown out regularly, and even if I don't find a job immediately in January I have to get out, even if it is to live in my car. I have some serious health problems and need to keep every bit of my paychecks to keep health insurance as long as I can after December. I had a stroke that was unrecognized and I'm dealing with a number of health issues that impact my ability to deal with all of this. When I had a job, and as often as I could when I didn't have a job, I made payments faithfully, I just can't promise that without a promise from an employer.In these circumstances, what should I send to the lawyer for the credit card? What do I need to submit to the court?(I believe the date the legal aid lawyer told me may have been ### said it was Nov. 20, but it looks like Nov. ### ###. ###. I don't know how that is calculated officially, I assumed she knew what she was talking about and that there must be some different method for NC courts.)43782.9875 Good afternoon, again, Ms. Bowling:Just saw your other question.  If you were ### by the landlord, you need to find out from the Sheriff (or from the municipal police department of the town/city in which this happened, if the trespass action was handled by an agency other than the ### County Sheriff's Office), why you were ###.  Whether the ban is lifted is ultimately up to the landlord, so if you have legitimate reasons relating to your mother's care and maintenance given her health condition, you and the landlord need to work that out.  You can email, call or write to the landlord in an effort to get this resolved.  Also look at your mother's lease and see what it says about lawfully invited guests.  On the one hand, your mother as tenant has the right to invite visitors and guests (within certain specifications that should be included in the lease), but on the other hand, if the landlord can point to legitimate concerns about your ### on the property, the landlord can still have you ###; it does need to be for good cause, however.So the three follow-up actions based on what you have written about this issue are the following: (###) find out what your mother's lease says about ### to the property; (###) find out from the relevant law enforcement agency why you were ###; and/or (###) try to arrange some reasonable accommodation with the landlord whereby your privilege of access to the property is restored so that you can take care of your mother, under assurance that the landlord will not call law enforcement on you.I hope something peaceful and reasonable can be arranged soon.  If needed, contact a local real property or landlord-tenant lawyer to send a letter/email to the landlord on your behalf, in an effort to work through the legal ### of this situation.Best wishes to you, again.43783.7451388889 I was banned by the landlord from my mother's residence but I was never given documentation as to why. I have read that you have to violate a rule in the lease in order to be banned. My mother had a stroke and was forced into agreeing with the landlord but wants to know how to redact this. Also like I stated he never told me as to why I was banned.43783.4368055556 Good afternoon, Ms. Bowling:Thank you for your question.  What particular reasons has the landlord given for proceeding with eviction?  The four main reasons allowed in small claims court are (###) nonpayment of rent, (###) material breach of the lease (other than nonpayment of rent), (###) illegal conduct on the premises, and (###) holdover status after the lease has naturally expired.  Any of these, in isolation or combination, would be sufficient for the landlord to file a Complaint for Summary Ejectment. Discrimination" in a legal sense means an adverse action taken by a landlord against a tenant based on the tenant's race color national origin sex religion disability or age (if over ###0).  That word has a specific legal meaning that may not necessarily apply in the more ### manner in which you likely intended it.Lastly North Carolina law forbids a landlord from engaging in a retaliatory eviction in response to a tenant's engaging in legally protected activities.  Under N.C.### Â§ ######-###7.### (Article ###A of the North Carolina Landlord-Tenant Act) a landlord cannot evict a tenant for doing any of the following:"(###)        A good faith complaint or request for repairs to the landlord his employee or his agent about conditions or defects in the premises that the landlord is obligated to repair under ### ######-######;(###)        A good faith complaint to a government agency about a landlord's alleged violation of any health or safety law or any regulation code ordinance or State or federal law that regulates premises used for dwelling purposes;(###)        A government authority's issuance of a formal complaint to a landlord concerning premises rented by a tenant;(###)        A good faith attempt to exercise secure or enforce any rights existing under a valid lease or rental agreement or under State or federal law; or(5)        A good faith attempt to organize join or become otherwise involved with any organization promoting or enforcing tenants' rights."As long as the tenant has otherwise met all obligations to the landlord (most importantly but not exclusively that of paying rent) the landlord cannot punish the tenant for doing any of the things above or causing them to happen.  "Retaliatory eviction" is a defense rather than a claim so it comes into play only when the landlord has actually sued the tenant for eviction based on improper grounds and then in that instance the tenant may show up in court and allege retaliatory eviction under the ### statute which will defeat the landlord's case and lead to a dismissal of the action without penalty or negative consequence to the tenant (as long as the tenant has paid rent and has not otherwise breached the lease).Please let me know if I need to explain further but this is generally what you need to know about both (###) discrimination and (###) retaliatory eviction.  Please note that mere ### by the landlord does not necessarily mean illegality although in some situations such as I have described above it may.Hope this helps somewhat.  Blessings to you and your mother this winter."43783.7375 The landlord has taken my ###. Now he has found another unfair untrue reason and is taking her back to court what can she do about this discrimination.43783.4388888889 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for this question.  First, I congratulate you on your ### in small claims court; it is rare for a tenant to win such a case against a landlord, at least based on my observation and experience as a lawyer.  Second, whether you should go the extra mile and report" the landlord depends on whether this landlord is a business or just a person who rents a ### apartment unit to tenants.  If it is a professional real property management company reporting the business to the Better Business Bureau Buncombe County Chamber of Commerce or the consumer protection bureau of the North Carolina Attorney General's Office might be appropriate.However if this is an individual landlord I would recommend that you simply stop here.  Your ### in court vindicated your interests and if this is not a corporate landlord you really have no vested interest in protecting the general public of Buncombe County from shady landlords.  While your motives are very noble and quite ### in the eyes of the law your going further and "outing" the private individual landlord can be interpreted as ### and might even expose you to defamation liability if the landlord is able to trace the negative comments to you; this includes online reviews and negative comments posted in social media and other online ###.  I am not saying that your criticisms would not be justified or that they would be wrong but just be forewarned that if the landlord wishes to risk money and time to pursue some sort of defamation action in court you could get sued even if you eventually win by pleading truth as an affirmative defense to the landlord's claim against you.  I do not know the chances of the landlord wanting to sue you but just know that that is a risk you run if you go above and beyond already beating this landlord in court; a judge might say "Why did you take this extra step when you already vindicated your rights against the landlord in a court proceeding?"  Food for thought.  I trust your judgement as to what you think you need to do going forward.  Have a blessed winter and Thanksgiving holiday."43783.7534722222 I recently won a small claims court case against my landlord.  I would like to know which organizations / agencies and/or people that I can contact in regards to him?  I won the case in Buncombe County, NC and the residence was in ### County, NC.  My plan is to write a letter explaining what happened while my wife and I lived there, and mail them to the appropriate people.  I would like to do what I can to prevent him from treating other tenants as poorly as he did us.43783.63125 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  This is very unfortunate, and I am sorry you are having to deal with this immaturity on the other side of your custody arrangement.  Thankfully, at least, you already have a separation agreement in place, which most people who post questions on this site do not have, and that generally hurts them.  At least you already have something on paper that says what your rights are, and which a judge can enforce should you go to court over this.Unfortunately, almost no reputable lawyer in private practice will do a custody proceeding for free, so your options are more limited than they should be (through no fault of your own, of course).  ### Family Law Clinic in ### might be able to provide you with some free guidance for a short period of time, in addition to offering you their ###" packet for custody matters which I think costs less than $30.###.  See more information at the below link:http://law.###.edu/clinics/family-law/###/Give them a call and see what they can provide you to help you with your case.Also contact the Craven County Courthouse to see if they have self-help filing packets in the family court section of District Court which might help you as well.  Should you litigate your own matter you need to become familiar with the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (available at ### under General Statutes Chapter ###) the Rules of Evidence (Chapter ###) and the Craven County District Court Local Rules (available at ###).I hope this is helpful and be sure to ask the ### folks whether an emergency custody hearing is warranted based on the facts of your situation.  Blessings to you and your family this winter."43784.6652777778 How would one go about trying to find a pro bono divorce attorney from a separate county as the other party? We have been separated almost two years and I have been living five hours away, and unfortunately the custody part of our separation agreement has come to light as a major issue. I don't have money for representation but I want to protect my rights and end this marriage formally. In a heated conversation about child support and having custody of my child this Christmas, I ### the conversation with I'm out" (he has a tendency to try to manipulate situations and conversation into unneccesary areas- generally I cut out talk short until he can get level enough to maturely approach the situation with me in an effort to make this split as civil as possible for our daughter's sake) and he is choosing to take this stament as a self revocation of my parental rights which is not the case. I'm at a loss as to what to do and am unable to contact my daughter now."43784.6097222222 Good afternoon, ###:Thank you for this question.  While I do not think you need to hire a lawyer for any long-term representation (a good thing, since that will not strain your finances), I would strongly recommend at least one consultation of one hour with a seasoned family law or civil litigation attorney.  The reason I say this is for two reasons: (###) the attorney can look at the subpoena (and any paperwork served with it when it arrived) and tell you whether you have any grounds to quash it under Rule 45(c)(5) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, and (###) assuming the subpoena was indeed lawful and proper, and you therefore must appear in court to avoid being held in contempt, you need to be advised of how answer the questions, and what questions you are likely to be asked.  I think you would find it highly useful to have an attorney familiar with civil litigation to walk you through how to make it through direct examination, cross examination and ### examination.  It would be well worth your hour and your money, although you would not have to spend too much for just a single consultation on this issue.I would try to set something up next week if at all possible.  Use ### Find a Lawyer" feature the Greensboro Bar Association and the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association as vetting resources.  I hope all goes well for you in this matter and hope Thanksgiving is rewarding to you.Have a blessed winter."43785.71875 I have been issued a subpoena in a civil case between a former husband and wife. I have been involved for a while with one of the former spouses. I received this subpoena at the person I am involved with home.

I do not know this person yet yes I am involved and have been involved with the defendant for some time now. I have been issued to testify in a court.

Court date is set for ### in Catawba County and I live in Guilford County. Thank you in advance for any help I ###.43785.1013888889 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Non-competes are matters that regularly come before me in my law practice, and I have found that, unfortunately, a lot of folks like ### are not acting maliciously or wrongfully against your former employers, but are simply trying to make a better life for yourselves and your ### yourselves in situations similar to this.  I read over your attached letter and non-compete agreement (thank you for that; it allows me to more accurately tailor my otherwise general information and advice to your situation), and have concluded that, as long as the geographical range between your immediate past and current employer is a reasonable ###, for example, 50, ### ###--this non-compete will be upheld under North Carolina.  This conclusion assumes that the non-compete was either (###) negotiated as part of your initial employment in ###0###5, or (###) was requested of you to sign in exchange for something else of ### as a raise, one-time bonus or ### if it happened after your initial hire by the past employer.  Assuming (###) or (###) is met by the facts in ###0###5, and the geographical scope of both businesses is roughly the same, the non-compete is legal.I nonetheless do not necessarily believe that this is fair to you and your kids, being myself the son of a single-mother who would have been hurt by a similar arrangement had my mother been subject to the same.  It is also unfair that some former employees are targeted by the company, and others are not, but that is not relevant in a legal sense; the company has the right to pursue, or not pursue, whomever it wants, as long as it has a valid non-compete to enforce against the employee in question.While I think you are good on the other things ### as not retaining any proprietary information from your past employer, and not trying to divert past ### from your former ### are likely in violation of the promise not to become an associate or employee of a direct competitor.  You do not have to quit your current job if you do not want to, but please be aware that the past employer has the right to sue you if it wants, and more likely than not, your past employer will win (not a guarantee, but a strong likelihood nonetheless).  The key ### here is to consult with a contracts, corporation or employment law attorney BEFORE you take a new position, in order to determine, on the front end, whether you risk civil liability for breach of contract, or any ### torts, by taking a job with a direct or ### competitor of your current employer.I wish I had more ### words to offer since I very much desire that you and your children ###, but this is an honest and ### legal opinion based on my prior experience with non-competes, both as a lawyer for employers and employees.Blessings to you and your family this winter and Thanksgiving.43785.75 I recently went to work in a different position an another HVAC company, and my previous employer is trying to enforce the non compete agreement.  I was a sales Coordinator at the previous company and I am a plumbing ###er at the new company.  I have nothing to do with selling HVAC equipment.  I am in charge of the plumbing ###.  I left my previous employer for better benefits with a smaller company and better hours that allowed me to spend more time with my family.  I feel I am being singled out because every one at the previous company that has left the company signed a non compete agreement and gained employment with direct competition doing the exact same job and the owner did not go after them or threaten them the way I have been threatened.  The company I am working for now has less than ### 150, with multiple locations all over the state of NC.  I am a single parent with limited income and I cannot afford to go up against this company for nearly trying to make a better life for my family.  43785.7236111111 Ms. ###:As your tentative written response shows, you are an intelligent lady.  This is as strong a response as I can ### of given the circumstances, and if there was indeed sex discrimination BEFORE you left employment, that will work against your past employer, and could be grounds for a lawsuit; that would require an in-person discussion with an experienced, full-time employment law attorney (which, admittedly, I am not), many of whom might offer you a ### ### initial consultation for free or for relatively low cost.  If what your argument turns on, however, is that you were bullied, or that you were treated rudely, or that only females were ### AFTER leaving employment, the court is still likely to side with the employer in upholding the non-compete, even if the judge privately regrets ruling in such a way out of personal sympathy towards you as the innocent single mother that I believe you to be.I appreciate your courteous follow up and preview of your response, which I thought was careful, deliberate and ###.  I think you are handling an unpleasant situation as best as you possibly can, and I commend you for that.  I hope you can get through this and keep your job, so that you can build a better future for you and your kids.God bless you.43785.8618055556 Thank you so much for your kind words!  If, after sending my response to my previous employer and I continue to work for the new company to provide for my family, and the previous employer still pursued legal action, do you know what the qualifications are for low cost or pro bono representation?  I cannot afford an attorney as I have spent 30k over the last ###.  I have all but filed for bankruptcy.   I am not ### of my financial situation, but I would do it all over again if it meant my family was safe.Thank you and may God bless you too!  I do believe in the power of ###!  43785.9055555556 Thank you so much!  I have attached my response to them for you to review, I havenâ€™t sent it yet, and I do have a witness (HR manager) to the meeting that was had in regards to my ###.  Itâ€™s almost as if Iâ€™m being discriminated against because I am a female. I have no direct knowledge of this happening to any males that left the company. I feel like I am being bullied or something for wanting to do better for my family.43785.7597222222 You are so welcome.  ### has gotten me through many tough places, including at present.  I am grateful for the many ###-induced ###, as I am sure you are.Let's hope that no lawsuit is filed, since almost no lawyer of merit would be able to defend you without a sizable retainer; there are no formal qualifications" for pro bono representation in civil lawsuits in the same way that there is for indigent defense (i.e. public defenders) in criminal prosecution cases.  Lawyers would typically need to budget for about ### ### (depending on how hard the other side fights it and whether a jury trial is needed to resolve outstanding issues versus having a judge do so by summary judgment assuming settlement does not occur during mediation) so very few lawyers can afford to ### that many hours at $### $###.  Some can afford to and might consider it but that is a relatively small number more out of financial necessity rather than greed or selfishness.Hopefully this will not get to that point.  Keep in mind however that if this becomes more of a sex discrimination case rather than a pure non-compete case an employment law firm with ### resources probably would take this with little or no money upfront since a discrimination case in federal court strong enough to entice a firm to take a case would likely prove profitable for the firm in the final run.  But if this is not a sex discrimination case as I suspect and it is purely a state court case about the non-compete only that will be very difficult to defend against without money for a civil litigation defense lawyer.Best wishes and blessing again."43785.9173611111 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for this question, and my sincere regrets that you are having to deal with such childish nonsense.  Yes, the facts you stated in your summary, if proven by documentary and/or other evidence, would indeed be justifiable grounds for a lawsuit.  While more claims might exist than are immediately clear to me from having read a brief paragraph about this, it is clear to me that at least two claims exist from the outset: (###) defamation and (###) malicious interference with prospective economic advantage.  The false statements against you constitute defamation in the form of libel (written format, as opposed to slander, which is spoken format), and by encouraging current or prospective vendors, customers, clients, etc., from doing business with you, there is unjustified interference with your ability to operate in the free marketplace, and earn your productive livelihood.  It is one thing for an actual client or customer to post a negative, ### review based on a negative experience with the business, and another thing to post false statements out of spite.  The first is not actionable, and the second is totally wrong and can be sued upon in court.This type of lawsuit will be expensive to pursue, and would likely require at least several thousand dollars paid upfront, as few lawyers would be able to pursue this on a pure or even mostly contingency basis, so that will be your major potential hurdle, depending on the state of your finances.  Also, you must keep in mind whether the ### defendant is capable of paying a court judgment should you win, versus being judgment proof" and unable to pay once you try to execute your judgement against that person's assets.   But if you consider these more practical points and still decide that this is worth your pursuing then by all means start researching North Carolina lawyers in your area who handle business litigation cases and see if terms of representation can be worked out.  I think you have a really good case as long as you can afford to finance litigation.Hope this helps and I really do hope you can regain your and your business' financial footing going forward.Be well this winter and Thanksgiving."43785.89375 Hello,I own a small online clothing boutique. Recently, two women on Facebook screenshot and shared a comment I made in a personal text conversation with a third party, shared it publicly, and then publicly posted several lies about me and my business (ie. That I had stolen photos, used photos of their kids without permission, violated someone's copyright, etc.). They have also encouraged the public to help them close my business, and my online store and Facebook business page are being swarmed with fake customer accounts, fake reviews, fake comments, etc., designed to hurt my business. They even posted my cell phone number and signed me up for ###. This has been going on for a month and my business is practically bankrupt. Does this sound like it meets the criteria for a lawsuit?Thank you.### ###43785.8701388889 ###* 43786.1722222222 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  You have two options, which you may pursue at the same time if you desire, or you can choose one over the other.  First, you can call law enforcement and report the suspects and mention that they have been seen wearing your clothes.  While I agree with you that their crime was not burglary due to the door being open, I do believe also that the crime of larceny still ###, the unlawful taking of the property of another."  A report should be made so that a paper trail with law enforcement is made with witness statements from anyone who saw the suspects with your things.Second you can also sue in small claims either for (###) the return of all items stolen (known as "replevin") or (###) for the monetary value of what was stolen (known as "###").  This would be $######.  Hopefully you can get your property back through the criminal justice process rather than through a small claims lawsuit but since one is criminal and the other civil you can actually pursue them both.Filing fee for small claims court is $### plus $30.### (you will need an address at which to serve the defendants; the deputy sheriff will do the actual work once you file the summons provide the addresses and pay the fee per defendant).One thing I would ask law enforcement when you make the police complaint is whether the restitution process is likely to get you everything back; if the answer is yes that might save you the headache and effort of having to sue in small claims court.  Best wishes to you this winter."43786.1916666667 My question is, how can I receive me stuff back?###,### $###. I was at work and my cousin usually stay at the apt when Iâ€™m gone but he left and didnâ€™t lock the door, itâ€™s fine because i live in a safe neighborhood. I choice not to call the cops because I had marijuana and marijuana accessories so i didnâ€™t want to go in the trouble clearing out my apt and plus the door was open so technically isnâ€™t wasnâ€™t a â€œbreak inâ€. I actually suspected someone and she told me it wasnâ€™t her obviously. One day i saw her and her friend and one of her friends was wearing my shirt that I was missing and i told her i have the same shirt but she told me she got at a store but the store she named dont sell that shirt as well as you canâ€™t find that shirt anymore. After that day i never saw them again. After some time I saw someone who knew who they were but I didnâ€™t really talk to that person. He comes up to me and said â€œman Iâ€™m telling you this because i really feel badâ€ â€œi know where you liveâ€ and i donâ€™t tell anyone random person where i live, he named the neighborhood, i was shock and he continued to say â€œthe people who took your stuff was those girlsâ€ i really didnâ€™t tell anyone what happened and out of no where he told me that i really donâ€™t know what to do as in how to get my stuff back. Should i go to the police or do a civil suit? I know the full name of one of the girls but only the 1st name of the second one. And should i get a lawyer? 43786.1708333333 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:As someone who has purchased or been gifted several cars from relatives or friends, without any involvement by dealerships as middle parties, I will say that you will most likely have to locate the owner and get the transfer form notarized.  I do not see a lawful ### (at least not based on the limited information I have about this transaction) that NC DMV would accept.  In order to confirm that you or I are not missing any ### or steps that could further complicate your situation, I strongly recommend that you Google the DMV ### office closest to your residence, and personally visit, explaining the situation for guidance from them.  (I would say call them, but it has been my experience that calling them means being on hold for half an hour before the automated system ### up on you; going in person and speaking with live people will be more effective in getting the information you need to get this done right the first time.)  If there are any more convenient ways to handle this besides the course I presently see, DMV can clear this up and tell you.  But more likely than not, you are going to have to procure the seller's notarized signature.I hope you can accomplish what you need to do without a lot of inconvenience, expense or headache.  I have dealt with DMV a number of times over ### relating to this, so I empathize with you in this situation.  Please have a good Thanksgiving, and I wish you a very productive and rewarding winter, and ###.43790.7541666667 Good afternoon,I purchased a used car online. I met with the owner and paid cash. They gave me the ### of sale and the title with their signature. I am from another state and didn't know that I needed to get the title notarized. I cannot get a hold of the owner at all. What can I do so that I can get tags on the car and drive it?43790.7444444444 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question, and I regret your recent hardships described herein, although they are totally understandable.  Since lawyers are ### prohibited from direct solicitation of business from new clients, no lawyer can come forward and offer his/her services to you without some indication of interest by you first.  Thus, I will offer a few recommendations of lawyers who might be willing to help you if you contact them first and express interest.  I have somewhat diversified the geographical home bases of the lawyers in case your ticket was from outside ### County, and please be aware that many lawyers who handle traffic matters practice in several counties, and not just one.  Please see the following possibilities:### Powers (###): https://www.carolinaattorneys.com/###-powers.html### Guy ### (NC ### and other counties): https://www.avvo.com/attorneys/27704-nc-###-###-1736343.html### ### (###): https://www.attorney######.com/### ### (### and possibly surrounding counties): https://www.polarislawfirm.com/teammate/###-m-###-esq/Hope this helps.  These are all good lawyers.  Happy Thanksgiving to you next week.43794.0666666667 I am  sad and have no money but need to get my driver's license so can go home. I need to see my dad who has been in a home.  I got stopped for my tag being expired and did not show for court due to my disability.  Then I got stopped ###. Called DMV they said I needed a lawyer.  So I am reaching out find one .43790.8215277778 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question, and I am so sorry you had this accident.  I can think of a couple ways to go about this.  First, alert the police officer who made the first report that the driver at fault provided you with false information relating to insurance, and see how the officer responds.  You can likely get driver registration information through the police officer when s/he looks the driver up in the law enforcement database, and the registration information should confirm whether Geico or any other provider is listed for insurance purposes.  The police officer can advise on whether (###) charges can be filed for knowingly providing false information to an officer investigating a car accident, and (###) the report can be amended to include the new (correct) information, upon the officer's confirmation of the same.You might also reach out to your own insurance and ask for advice on how to pursue the ### driver given the difficulty you have been getting from Geico.  I am sure they have ideas on how to approach this, and your agent might even be able to call the Geico agent who has rejected your ###, and work something out.Lastly, personal injury lawyers usually work on contingency bases, so if a personal injury lawyer around town confirms that ###00% of the fault is attributable to the other driver (note that NC is a contributory negligence jurisdiction, in which any shared fault will defeat the claim, even if the other driver is ###% responsible), it is highly likely that you could find a lawyer who would settle your claim and wait to be paid on the back end.  This assumes of course that your claim is strong enough to withstand contributory negligence claims by the opposing side's insurance.This is how I would approach this going forward.  You can find personal injury lawyers in your local area using ### Find a Lawyer" feature or by contacting the ### County Bar the Wake County Bar or the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association.  I wish you the very best in your inquiries and hope that Thanksgiving and this winter are productive and fulfilling to you.  All the best."43790.8458333333 I was in a car accident, the driver from that car gave wrong information about her insurance, she told she had state farm but in reality her insurance is geico. In the police report it can be clearly seen she is the one at fault. On the ### ### ### ###. Her insurance keeps saying that she's not at fault even with the proof.  My car has a busted ### on the driver's side and a hit above the front wheel. I was driving on Hardee St. Heading to Walmart. I was in a stop light on intersection ### st. it was on red. The other vehicle was on the turn left lane. When the light turned ### the vehicle turned abruptly to the right an hit my car by the front left light and instead of parking on the side of the road she tried to leave. There was moderate traffic on so she couldn't leave my brother took some pictures of her plate and I followed her to ### St. There was no rain or road obstructions that day. I got out the car to check the damage on my car and she asked me if I was going to call the police to which I replied yes. My brother ### called ###. The police came about ###. While waiting a lady came to speak with the other driver and left when the police arrived. What can I do in this case? I cannot afford a lawyer and I think what is going on right now is a great injustice.43790.8368055556 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I doubt that any petition or lawsuit against the lawyers would succeed.  It is very common in class action lawsuits to interview a large class of potential plaintiffs, only to sue on behalf of some of those ###, and not others; this is part of litigation strategy in terms of which plaintiffs are likely to meet all the required legal elements of whatever legal and/or equitable claims are asserted against the hog ###.  It is also possible that some claims failed during the lawsuit due to successful procedural defenses and motions to dismiss filed by the defendant(s) in the case, although I can only speculate since I am not privy to the minute details of the lawsuit you reference.  All I am saying is that there is a lot more to these types of decisions and litigation maneuvers than you have been informed about since the lawsuit was filed.Assuming that neither one of the lawyers or successful plaintiffs volunteers the information you are seeking, you will probably need to hire a lawyer to do some research for you by visiting the courthouse and photocopying the entire litigation file, studying it with a lawyer's eyes for procedural moves that might yield clues into why certain plaintiffs or ### plaintiffs were excluded from settlement proceeds.  Please note, however, that not all aspects of settlement negotiations make it into the public, courthouse file, since settlements are largely guarded by confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements (###").  More information will be available if compensation occurred as a result of a summary judgement order or jury verdict but less information will be available if the matter was settled before final resolution by a judge or jury.Getting the answers you want assuming that is even possible will require paying a lawyer for his/her time in doing some digging.  If you are interested in that reach out to a lawyer who handles civil litigation cases and see what can be arranged.  Have a blessed Thanksgiving winter and ###."43791.0895833333 Years ago, a firm came around & took names for a lawsuit pertaining to a hog farm nuisance". Since then money has been issued but the lawyers picked people out of the group to compensate & not others. Some people got money & no longer live in the county. Some people that live in the county that filed were let go by the lawyers. I'm trying to find a petition to file or something against the lawyers that won this claim. They got all these people to sign up for it in order for it to go to trial & then they dismissed people before the money was issued. I'd like to know how they decided who would be compensated & who would not."43791.08125 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  If an appeal is currently pending, the following are true:###.  The landlord may not forcibly evict you, either acting alone or with cooperation of the Sheriff, unless/until the landlord prevails for possession on appeal, AND ### a Writ of Possession from the Sheriff.  Only then can a sheriff deputy come by and evict you by force if needed, within approximately ### (give or take a day).###.  The landlord may come onto the premises with legal counsel (or alone) and take pictures of the property.  There is nothing improper or illegal about that.###.  The lease under which you are living, assuming you are not evicted, remains legally binding until the natural expiration of that lease, or the parties agree to modify it in order to shorten or lengthen the tenancy.###.  Even if you are liable for nonpayment of rent or any other grounds for eviction, you can still counterclaim for breach of the implied warranty of habitability (N.C.G.S. Â§ ######-######), and be awarded rent abatement for the periods during which the rodent infestation or any other serious habitability defect went unaddressed, after the landlord was afforded actual notice" of the problem and had a reasonable time to cure such defect(s).  You can cite the health inspector's sanctions as evidence of the landlord's negligence and/or bad faith.Read more about the habitability requirements at this link:https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_######/gs_######-######.htmlDo these points address your concerns?

If you remain in small claims, no subpoena powers are possible; if in District Court, the answer is yes.

I was saddened to see these photos, especially given that she is only ten years old!  I really hope she is on the mend.As a lawyer, I would be skeptical that you could get very far in a lawsuit against the manufacturer, retailer or ### most ### defendants in a products liability lawsuit.  Here is what lawyers representing one or any of these parties would say in a lawsuit (or would say through their insurance carriers if a private claim was asserted, short of litigation): the real injury came when your daughter insisted on pulling the jacket to make it fit, despite it being clear that it would not fit as she anticipated.  The lawyers or insurance adjusters on the other side would also argue that there is no way in telling whether the ### of the zipper came to you defective, or whether it was slid, bent or otherwise ### or ### the time it was purchased.  The manufacturer is the ### removed from the actual purchase of the jacket (unless of course it was at an ### store where it was purchased), so that might be the hardest party to sue.  In short, the argument on the other side will be that your daughter's use of the jacket, and not the jacket itself, was the real cause of the accident, as cold as that sounds.I do not mean to come across as insensitive here, but I have had enough fights with insurance adjusters and lawyers (usually as I represent plaintiffs) to know that the facts you stated, alone, do not really mean that you have a good claim or lawsuit against ###.  But if you wish to get a more detailed opinion than can be properly had on a website like this, by all means gather the medical records and photos, and consult with a products liability or personal injury lawyer wherever you can find a reputable one.  You can use ### Find a Lawyer" feature and also the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association.  Blessings to you and your daughter this winter Thanksgiving and ###."43792.1173611111 Hi, my ###, and she had a terrible accident. While she was attempting to put the jacket on, she slipped the jacket on over her head, only to see that her head wouldnâ€™t fit all the way through the head part of the jacket, she thought that if she could zip the jacket down just a little bit she could hurry and get the jacket on so she can get to school. She went to zip the jacket down and her eye lid got ### into the zipper instead. I immediately thought how in the world could this happen because Iâ€™ve never seen anything like that happen before. We could not release the jacket zipper from her eyelid. I had to take her to the emergency room where they had the right tools to cut the metal zipper frame off of her eyelid, it was as if  the zipper was made over her eyelid. She had minor right eye injury, we went to the eye doctor this morning and they are determining within a month if her vision in her right eye was ###red from the swelling or just a natural eye ### that she already had that we didnâ€™t know about. She was saddened about the doctors having to cut the jacket, but more greatful that they were able to release it from her eyelid. Iâ€™m going to send some attachments of her injury.

Assuming you already filed the motion with the Clerk, the wrong state at the top will likely not be much of a problem (especially if you got the case number right based on the NC court system's ### ### ###, ### ###, etc.).  However, I would try to correct both errors just for the record, even if that means you refile and re-serve the opposing party.  However, the safest way to know for sure what you should do here is to simply call the Clerk of Superior Court's office, ask one of the assistants to pull the file, and ask them whether you should come in and make the cosmetic corrections.  If they tell you are fine, you are fine.  Otherwise, consider making the corrections, and ### the opposing party.Best wishes to you in your litigation matter, and a blessed ###.43794.1465277778 Thank you43794.6131944444 You are very welcome.

You might very well indeed have a case or claim against ### Restaurant.  Hopefully you have medical records from an ER or other healthcare consultation that shows when, where and how you suffered, to show that this happened very quickly after your meal; the reason I say this is that, based on my prior experience with similar claims, the restaurant's insurance adjuster is likely to say that they do not know for sure whether your illness was a direct result of the meal (although common sense would tell you that it was; they know this, but this is the way the game is played).  Any evidence you have that confirms your illness and symptoms, and when and for how long they manifested, would be very helpful in pursuing a claim or lawsuit (probably a claim, since both sides will prefer to privately negotiate and settle the matter rather than litigate in court).  The restaurant's insurance adjuster is more likely to take you seriously if you have retained a personal injury lawyer who has properly vetted the chances of your claim's success and monetary value.  Many personal injury lawyers charge small or no consultation fees, after which they work almost completely on contingency if they decide to take your case.Try reaching out to local personal injury law counsel in ### or Wake County, in addition to using ### Find a Lawyer" search function (free of charge) and contacting the Wake County Bar for referrals.  The Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association is also a possibility.

I am very sorry you have had these ailments.  It is hard to say for sure why no lawyers have taken your invitation to representation as of yet.  While I have no definitive, authoritative answers to offer, I can fill you in a little on how lawyers factor whether to take a new ### in the medical malpractice or ### injury areas.First, these cases are the most risky for lawyers because they are done almost entirely on a contingency basis, which means that the lawyer and his/her firm might ### up to ###; at $### $###, this could be $25,### $35,###, yet the overhead expenses of running a practice, and of ### your expenses for depositions, discovery and expert witnesses, keep mounting by the day.  So a lawyer will want to be assured that this is a worthy gamble, and also that the party being sued has a robust insurance policy that will cover any liabilities established by a successful lawsuit.  Not every law firm has the financial resources to stick in the fight that long, although the other side usually does have the resources to wait it out until a negotiating advantage can be secured.  It is a very risky enterprise for both lawyer and client, though for different reasons.I do not know how many lawyers you have contacted, but I would reach out a little further, and try tapping the ### medical malpractice bar for its talents, as well as ###, Greensboro, Hickory and ###.Also, I think it could be helpful to politely inquire of the past lawyers who so far have declined representation to inform you as to their thinking on this, which might help you better understand some angles you need to clear as you discuss possibilities further with other lawyers.  It has been my experience, however, that highly capable medical malpractice lawyers who see a good case will generally take it, as long as they believe they will get paid in the end, and also that the client will be a cooperative one during the litigation.  You just have to be very diligent and savvy in these discussions, and exercise ### in the lawyers you are vetting online.Try considering ### Find a Lawyer" feature and also consider contacting the ### County Bar.   Lastly the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association might also yield fruit; contact them and see what referrals you get.I hope all goes well for you and that this winter will bring you better developments as you get ready for ###.

Honestly, having answered questions in this venue ever since it was opened in North Carolina in ###0###8, I think that your legal issue is beyond the expertise of the North Carolina lawyers who make regular, monthly commitments to answering questions here on a pro bono basis; in fact, none of the lawyers who regularly use this site (and I either know or know of them all, virtually), practice in the area of military affairs.  Rather, we are almost always family law attorneys, civil ###, estate ### attorneys, real estate attorneys, or general practitioners ### in the areas of law one would associate with a ### size law practice in a town or small city.  This is the first question I have ever seen on this site in two years that requires a deep knowledge of military law.

I STRONGLY recommend emailing ### ### of ### ### law firm in ###, and asking him whether (###) he would be willing to help you on a pro bono basis, or (###) whether he could direct you to military law attorneys in his professional circle (### actually started one of the sections in the NCBA on military law, I believe, and has been a ### advocate for people like you, so he would know others who can help you if he is not able to at present).

Assuming there is no issue with any of these three things, I can only assume that the person held in jail whom you reference will be soon released, once the paperwork and administrative details of release are complete.  I hope you have a safe, rewarding and happy Thanksgiving, and a very good winter.43796.7569444444 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and I hope Thanksgiving was rewarding to you.  Unfortunately, there is little you can do at this point if you cannot afford a lawyer to send a final demand to your former sister-in-law, and/or sue her if she does not reasonably comply with the same.  I believe you are correct in your legal analysis to the effect that you are entitled to a ###/###, absent a written agreement to the contrary.  That much is clear and straightforward, and I do not think the facts of this situation overall are complicated, but the problem is getting the sister-in-law to see reason, and to pressure her with legal means if that proves necessary.  If the amount owed you is below $###0,000, you might consider small claims court, which would allow you to easily pursue this yourself in a simple proceeding, but otherwise, you will need a lawyer to help you procure the funds to which you are entitled, assuming the sister-in-law persists in this unreasonable behavior.  I wish I had more ### feedback to provide.Blessings and best wishes to you this winter, and in ###.43801.7527777778 they are renting property that is one third mine keeping all the money which is not legal.

And I paid with my card so I have proof . Thanks 43801.8715277778 Ms. ### -- To pursue a case against the nail salon you would have to prove that they committed some act that caused the infection.  The receipt alone is not going to be enough.  The receipt just shows that you paid them to perform whatever service they did that day.   For example, if I have a receipt from a ### shop that doesn't mean I can prove they caused me to have a head concussion that I treat for some time later.  The question is what proof do you have to show that ###) they did some wrong act that ###) led you to have the infection.  Did they cut you or injure you somehow at the time of the service?  Were their witnesses?  Any photos taken that day?  When did you first notice you had an infection?  When did you first get treatment?  How close in time was your first treatment date to when you were in the salon?  Did you mention going to the salon when you first got treatment for the foot?  Is a medical doctor saying that the ### actions caused the infection?  In court the burden is on you to show that they did something wrong and that what they did wrong caused an infection.  Whether or not you have a case depends on how strong your evidence is to prove those two things.  You may be able to make a claim with the Nail ### insurance carrier (assuming they had insurance) but often they deny these types of cases and your only recourse if you want to pursue it further would be to file suit.  If you feel that you have strong evidence proving the above you may  want to consult with attorneys in your area to see if you can find one to take on the case.  Simply look for attorneys who do premises liability" or "personal injury" type cases in the ### County area and you should find several that you can talk to in your search.  Best of luck to you!"43801.95625 Good evening, Ms. Cook:Thank you for your question, and I hope your Thanksgiving holiday weekend was rewarding.  This is a borderline case for a civil no-contact order, which falls under N.C.G.S. Chapter 50C rather than the more often used Chapter 50B, which applies to domestic violence situations.  If the letters in the mail are frequent enough and abusive enough in tone, you might be able to persuade a judge to issue a no-contact order based on either stalking or harassment; note that this will come down to very specific facts proven in court.  At the link below, see N.C.G.S. Â§ ###, which provides what remedies can be sought for a civil no-contact order:https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_50C/GS_###.pdfMoreover, N.C.G.S. Â§ ###. informs as to how to commence an action for a civil no-contact order, and there are no fees required to start one, which should help you since you would be able to do this on your own without any significant financial outlay (although you are always welcome to retain a family law or civil litigation attorney if you so desire).  See below:https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_50C/GS_###.pdfIf this situation has hit the breaking point and you can show that the party of whom you complain has crossed the lines of legality, visit your courthouse when you next have a chance and inform the Clerk that you wish to commence a civil no-contact proceeding (be sure to distinguish this from a domestic violence proceeding under Chapter 50B).Blessings and best wishes to you.43801.9645833333 I'm being harassed by a neighbor. Even though there are no credible threats of violence, just verbal threats, cussing, and harassment by mail can I get a restraining order to prevent my neighbor from contacting me?43801.9451388889 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and I hope Thanksgiving holiday weekend was rewarding to you.  I am not sure what you mean by this question in terms of leav[ing] the title open."  If you are selling your vehicle pursuant to a verbal agreement or written ### of sale you are in effect agreeing to transfer title to the buyer.  If you wish to reserve lienholder rights in the event that you are not receiving all payment upfront you can do that on your MVR form that you would hand over to the buyer for processing purposes.  If so title would provisionally transfer to the buyer upon condition that all terms of the ### of sale are honored.  At that time you would release your lien against the vehicle and the buyer would own title unconditionally. Make sense?Best wishes to you."43801.9777777778 I have someone who lives in another city who wishes to buy my car, but wants to leave the title open.

Based on what you have written here, you need to speak with an employment law ### one who handles lawsuits in the federal Eastern District of North Carolina, assuming that these issues arose between ### and the ### Banks (definitely, if this all happened in Halifax County).

If you are not an employee or independent contractor in relation to this organization, no, you do not need an employment law attorney (I had previously advised so because I mistakenly thought that you were an employee), but you could still talk with a corporate law attorney (many such practitioners are well versed in both corporate and nonprofit governance law, which would cover some of the issues you mentioned about not following certain policies).  It is possible that a ### advisory letter from an attorney to warn senior leadership to abide by protocols, policies, bylaws, laws, etc., will be enough to set things right.  The attorney in such situations often will send such warnings to the board of directors or trustees, and to the chief executive officer.Thank you for your blessings, which I fully accept and ###. 43802.0118055556 I'm looking for a pro bono bankruptcy attorney in ### 43802.6791666667 Blessings received, and ###!43803.8354166667 Mr. ###:This would be question for the Illinois officials running the website you mentioned, assuming all ### matters in your situation arose in Illinois.  There is little we in North Carolina can do concerning this, as expungements are entirely governed by statute, state to state.  I would try to find a helpline by which to raise your follow-up questions, and if needed, contact a nonprofit legal aid organization, or Illinois law school clinic, that handles expungements.  Sometimes you can find nonprofit groups or law school clinics that will help with this free of charge.Wish I could offer something more directly helpful to you, but almost all aspects of resolving this issue will reside in Illinois.  If you are currently a resident of North Carolina, you likely cannot register as a ### under the ABA Illinois Free Legal Answers, but you can still reach out to organizations in Illinois that do offer free help with expungements.  I hope you can find a good resource for you very soon.Have a safe, ### and productive winter and ###.43803.8319444444 Thank you.

I was travelling when i was arrested.43803.8277777778 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thank you for your important question, and I am so sorry this happened to you.  YES, you need to make a police report and that should ALWAYS be your immediate thing to do after you have retreated to safety following a violent altercation.  Alert the police that the person has also withheld access to your property, and law enforcement will let you know whether they can enter onto the property to help you retrieve your property in the course of the criminal investigation, or whether you need to proceed through small claims court.  As for demanding money from you, I suppose that she has a claim if you truly do owe her money, but given what she did to you, I seriously doubt that any small claims court is going to be sympathetic to her given that you were physically assaulted as part of her collection efforts."  There is an equitable doctrine in North Carolina called the "doctrine of unclean hands and what it means is that you cannot use the legal process to try to right a wrong when you have committed a corrupt act against the person against whom you are now asserting a claim.  It is up to the judge or magistrate as to whether to apply the doctrine of unclean hands, but I wanted to make you aware of that just in case your relative tried to sue you and present herself as the ### one in this relationship.Contact local law enforcement as soon as you can after reading this message.God bless you this winter, and in ###.43805.7145833333 I'm now back home which is in Florida. Does that change matters in any way? 43805.7166666667 No.  The ### County Sheriff's Department (if the incident happened outside a municipality) or the ###boro or North ###boro Police Department (assuming it happened within those towns' jurisdiction) still has local jurisdiction over this investigation.  Thanks for following up.43805.71875 On Sunday ### night I was attacked by a family member. I have a black eye and a split lip. She also forced me out of her home with only the bags I could carry. She's now demanding money before I can get my personal belongings out of her home. I didn't press charges or make a police report. Is it to late? What steps should I take from here on out?43805.4138888889 Filing a claim againist daughter who has attempted to have me involuntary commited ###, using a medication I have taken for awhile with no problems, with no ### ### last week with total fabrications as read on ED Report. I do not reside with daughter and very little communication with her. Need to know where to even begin a claim againist her.43805.8298611111 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Filing a defamation claim would be extremely difficult without a lawyer, so your first recommended step is to consult with a local civil litigator who handles defamation lawsuits.  Most such lawsuits are unsuccessful, for a number of reasons, and they are very expensive to pursue (usually at least $5,###, just to get started).  If your daughter tried to have you committed based on ### premises that this was necessary (even if she was misguided or mistaken), she can be faulted for being wrong, but being wrong" in this instance does not mean that she committed defamation in the legal sense (this word is used by the public too loosely often).  Defamation requires (###) a concrete statement of fact (###) of and concerning the plaintiff (###) written or spoken to a third party (###) resulting in ### or economic damage to the plaintiff.  The standard of proof is that the defendant either negligently made such disparaging remarks or did so with reckless regard for whether the statement was true or false.  I make no judgement as to whether you have a good claim here since I am not thoroughly familiar with every detail of this situation (not possible on a website like this which is designed for general information and brief legal advice not comprehensive guidance) but I do want you to be aware of just how difficult pursuing a defamation claim is especially if one is doing this without a lawyer.The filing fee for a civil complaint is $TERM00065### (payable to the Clerk of Superior Court) and the fee for service of process is $TERM00133### (payable to the Sheriff).  You would need to consult a civil litigation practice guide to see what the format should be for a civil complaint and can probably find such guides at one of the branches of the ### County Public Library.  You can do this on your own if you wish but I STRONGLY recommend at least one initial consultation with a civil litigator before you attempt this difficult process.Blessings and best wishes to you this winter and in the year ###0###0.  I hope that the new year will be better for you and your family."43805.8493055556 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers, and I hope you had a good weekend.  This is a tough situation since there does not appear to have been a written agreement that your aunt would be holding your vehicle only in trust, until such time that you could afford to insure the vehicle after the negative effects of your DUI wore off.  While trust arrangements like this can be verbal (as it appears yours was), this is hard to prove without other documentary evidence.  The only way to try to do this would be to sue in District Court or Superior Court (depending on how much money is at stake), and proceed under the equitable theory that is called constructive trust or sue on the actual theory of a trust; both would be based on the premise that your aunt had a fiduciary duty to you based on her agreement with you to hold the vehicle for safekeeping.  I cannot at all recommend doing this since, as someone who is involved in multiple lawsuits every year, I am not sure that you would win, especially if your aunt disputes your trust theory and tries to maintain that you outright gifted the vehicle to her.  The fact that she has already one one court case over this will most probably strengthen her hand.Two things I have learned after consulting with or advising clients on disputes involving transfers of title to motor vehicles are the following: (###) if there is some legally binding arrangement between you and someone else regarding the car that would not be readily apparent to outsiders looking in, be sure to have the arrangement in writing (and preferably either drafted or vetted by a lawyer); and (###) when there is no written contract to the contrary, the courts and the law will almost always side with whoever has legal title ACCORDING TO DMV.  No matter what the parties initially intended, failure to work through these two legal facts will cause problems in the future if/when disagreements later arise between the parties about who has what rights to the vehicle, whether they are rights of mere possession or rights of ownership.I wish I could write something more ### from your point of view, but having had clients with situations very similar to yours, this is the honest truth from a legal perspective.I hope you can work something out, one way or another, that allows you to be mobile and financially productive enough to take care of your pressing needs.  I realize that this is an uncomfortable situation, and I do ### with your difficulties.  Blessings and best wishes to you.43808.7763888889 I purchased a vehicle and have the ### of sale as well as receipts for all the work I had done to the car. However, due to a past dui I put the car in my aunts name on the title for a cheaper insurance rate. She stayed with me for a few weeks but when she didnâ€™t help with any ###s or rent, I put her out. She felt obligated to take my car because it was in her name. The court gave her my car. Because of that reason (title in her name). But I paid for everything and have proof of that. Am I not allowed the money owed for that car if she wants to keep it? She never paid for anything for it. I genuinely owned it and paid for the insurance for it and everything. How do I go about getting either my car back or the money I spent for it? She has no right to the car. It was only in her name so that I wouldnâ€™t have to pay a crazy insurance rate while the dui was on my driver record. I now donâ€™t have a vehicle because she took mine. And I lost my job because she kept taking me to court for it. 43808.7534722222 Is there a way I can convince the DMV to put the title back in my name with the evidence I have that proves the car is mine and I was completely and solely paying for it? Can the DMV help me at all with this situation? 43808.8194444444 No, DMV will not help at all.  They will read this situation literally.  From their point of view, and the law's, the car belongs to your aunt.  DMV is totally unconcerned about what ### arrangements might have existed between you and your aunt.  Unfortunate, but also true.43811.1673611111 I have been served a summons claiming I have ### on the property occupied by my mother. It claims that I was notified to neither stay nor remain there and was filed by the property owner's daughter. What documents do I need to take with me to prove that I told verbally to leave my grandmother's house, and was never told anything about the property my mother lives on. My mother owns the house on the property, but not the property itself.The summons lists code I ###.S. ###43808.9625 So I was charged with felony fleeing to ### arrest, reckless driving to endanger, speeding, driving while impaired, no operator's license and failing to stop for a stop sign. The police had ### ambulance take me to another countys hospital, left me, and never arrested me or took me into custody. Now they want me to turn myself  in. They also say an officer broke his arm while chasing me. I want to turn myself in so I can get a bond, but I just want to be prepared before going. 43809.5833333333 Good afternoon, ###:I appreciate your question.  This can be approached in a fairly straightforward manner: either you or a personal injury lawyer you retain can contact the hotel or the ### insurance, and indicate that you wish to file a claim for compensation based on bedbug infestation.  If you handle this yourself, you can expect that an insurance adjuster will contact you and take a recorded statement by phone; be very careful with what you say, as the goal of the insurance adjuster ### you will be to elicit statements from you that will reduce the monetary value of your claim as much as possible.  I have handled a very similar claim in the past on behalf of a client who had skin bites and clothing damage while visiting a timeshare in ### Beach, and after an initial ### offer of $###,500, we were able to settle for $###,800.  If you are offered a settlement sum, be aware that what you are really entitled to is likely $### $###, so counterclaim for that, and you will likely get to a deal, or very close to one.  You will need to show photos (such as the ones you have attached here, which are very helpful; thank you for that), as well as any emergency room, urgent care, ### or other type of medical treatment or consultation you might have sought in the aftermath of your vacation.  This will bolster the facts of your claim.  Also write down or show documentation for any complaints, maintenance requests, or other actions you immediately took while still at the hotel, which would support your claim that your room was infected with bedbugs BEFORE you arrived.  All this will increase the monetary value of your claim.Unless you suffered uncommon physical ###, I would guess that your claim would be worth, at most, at $###,000, accounting for (###) physical discomfort, (###) perhaps some mild clothing or luggage damage, and (###) general inconvenience.  This is a general educated guess, but if you believe in good faith that you are entitled to more, and you have adequate documentation, evidence and supporting facts to justify a higher demand, then by all means do so.Whether you hire a personal injury lawyer to handle communications and negotiations with the ### insurance really depends on your comfort level.  Doing this on your own will help you avoid legal fees on the one hand, but it also means that the insurance adjuster will work harder to lowball you based on an assumption that you lack the sophistication to negotiate a robust personal injury settlement; there are certain tricks that an adjuster will try against an unrepresented person that s/he would never try against an experienced personal injury lawyer.Use ### Find a Lawyer" feature and consider contacting the ### County Bar for referral possibilities.  The the type of lawyer would retain for this matter would be a personal injury lawyer.  There are many excellent choices in the greater-### area.One strong possibility if you choose to go the attorney route is ### Law Group in ###.  See the link immediately below:http://the###lawgroup.com/firm/If you contact them scroll down under the subject heading "Firm and find ### ### email.  Let him know that his old law school classmate, ### ### of ###, recommended his firm to you.

I HAVE PICTURES OF INSECTS BITES.  I DID INFORM FRONT DESK THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.  NOTHING WAS NEVER LOOK AT DID GIVE ME ### WIPE FOR MY ###.  AFTER RETURNING HOME I DID SPEAK TO THE GENERAL MANGER OF THAT LOCATION MR. ### TURNER43809.7194444444 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for this important question.  It really depends on the specific language of the final order of dismissal.  If the dismissal signed by the judge is narrowly worded to include only dismissal as to claims for liability against the driver in his/her individual capacity, then the employer is still in the lawsuit and might be found liable later in the litigation, assuming the plaintiff is able to win on the merits against the same.  If the dismissal with prejudice cancels out all claims against both the driver and the employer, then you cannot ever sue either again for the same claims that have been dismissed.Typically, if the dismissal is based only on failure to make effective service of process on a party (an objection the defendant(s) can raise under Rule 12(b)(5) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure), the dismissal is without prejudice, and the plaintiff can simply cure the procedural defect, the serve again (with new filing and service of process fees, of course).  But again, the most precise answer to your question depends entirely on the wording of the order.  Judges will typically make their rulings on dismissal narrow in order to give all parties the maximum opportunity to assert and defend against claims based on the factual merits, but this typical practice is not necessarily ### of what will happen.You might consider consulting with a local civil litigator for a brief period of time (###) to make sure that all of this is properly understood before the case is actually dismissed (assuming that has not yet happened).  This is especially true if the party drafting the order for the judge to sign is represented by legal counsel, and one side is not.  Both sides must have the chance to review and provide input as to the proposed Order before the judge accepts and signs it, but even so, the party without counsel will always have a disadvantage relative to the party who does have counsel.Have a blessed holiday season, and a productive and ### ###.43811.7222222222 What happens if the driver of the vehicle is dismissed with prejudice but the company owner of vehicle was served can a case still be ### on ### superior against the owner or is a dismissal for failure to serve adjudication to the merits and bars claim.43811.65625 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  While it appears that Jiffy Lube did something seriously wrong (based on your lengthy and helpful fact summary), the only way to get compensated is either to assert a claim against Jiffy ### insurance, or file a lawsuit.  I seriously doubt that you will get anywhere from this point on in terms of the local Jiffy Lube management; you are going to have to go up the corporate ladder and speak to a regional office official, or maybe even someone at headquarters.  You might be able to find a personal injury or general civil litigation lawyer willing to work on a contingency basis, but you will need to invest some time in finding the right lawyer who would be willing to attempt a private settlement with Jiffy Lube corporate management, or a lawsuit for money damages, that would not require to commit financial resources up front.  I really hope that a lawyer exerting pressure on Jiffy Lube through a demand letter threatening litigation will be sufficient to have your car repaired the way it should have been all along, AND for the claims department at Jiffy Lube to cut you a modest check for your inconveniences.  I hope all goes well for you in this matter.  Consider using ### Find a Lawyer" feature as well as the ### County Bar and Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association as referral resources.  God bless you and your family this winter and in ###."43811.7881944444 I have attached full detail of what has transpired from ### to present with Jiffy Lube. I have been in contact with ### and will be sitting with them soon to document my story with this matter.I entered a case with BBB and Jiffy Lube has not responded to the case yet and the deadline is approaching.  I have been calling the manager and he no longer returns my calls. Could I please be advised on what to do? I do not have the funds to sue Jiffy on my own and I am even interested in settling/ joining someone else's case. I also have screenshots of the phone calls made and returned to me by the manager of customer service for the company. 43811.7395833333 I had a car accident on ###. I called to file a claimed and was told by the representative that my insurance had lapsed (###) but that I could just make my late payment to reinstate. I did make that payment and was directed to continue to file the claim.  I filed the claim and continuously called to follow up on the claim.  In ###, I was sent a letter from the insurance stating that I was not covered.  I was informed that the insurance company has to grant a ###, is this true? My insurance company was State Farm Insurance at the time of the accident.43811.9090277778 So sorry about your accident.  You can call the Department of Insurance and they will be able to assist with your question and any complaint you may have.  In particular, the Consumer Services Division of the N.C. Department of Insurance assists consumers with resolving ### questions and complaints and helps them understand their options for dealing with these matters.  You can call them at ###-###.  43852.73125 A few factual questions:How does ### ### have the ability to turn off your water?  Is he your landlord?How does your neighbor know Mr. ### turned off your water?  What steps did you take, other than hiring a plumber, did you take to have your water turned back on?  Did you call a relative for help? Why did those steps take a few weeks"? What did you do for drinking water in those few weeks?  What about food? Was your fall the result of a lack of water or food? How did your neighbor insist that your water should be turned back on?  To whom?  Why were you unable to so?  You may have a case however it will be important to know the relationship you have with Mr. ###.  If he is your landlord or superintendent you have a stronger case.  If Mr. ### is a neighbor or a stranger it will be difficult to justify why this man would have turned off your water or why he cared that you washed your car.   If you can demonstrate that he is in fact mentally ill that may be sufficient justification as to his seemingly inexplicable actions.You will also have to  demonstrate the you took steps to mitigate that is help resolve your situation.  Did you call the utility company?  Police?  A family member for help?  It may be difficult to explain to a jury why your water was off for a few weeks -- your illness may have made taking action very difficult but most juries would feel that making phone calls is not overly strenuous.Additionally you will have to prove that your weight loss weakness and subsequent fall was due to a lack of running water and not your terminal illness.  This will require your medical records and very likely testimony from a doctor linking your injuries to your lack of running water.I recommend thinking about these questions and contacting a plaintiff's attorney in your area for further assessment of the strength of your case.  Most plaintiff's attorneys will provide a free consultation and do not require payment up front.  Rather they would accept 33 - 40% of whatever settlement or judgment you might receive.  Bringing suit against an individual is problematic however as even if you were to obtain a monetary verdict it is entirely possible that that individual does not have the means to pay.Best of luck and I'm sorry to hear this happened to you."43837.9270833333 I am a ###  My water was suddenly turned off in May of this year.

I seek monetary damages for my pain, suffering and monumental hospital bills.Do  I have a case?43812.8868055556 I have a case were my family was involved in that a bank in south ### did to us a few years ago trying to help someone that they know is real after ###. The bank sent us credit cards from chase bank, and a new Walmart card and only made ###. I was given ###. Now its on my record even tho the court paper says I was not involved. What should I do ?43812.8965277778 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  You are correct that you would have a claim against the landlord for failure to keep a working heating system in place; this violates the implied statutory warranty of habitability, codified at N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-###.  More specifically, a landlord is required to keep all aspects of the premises in a fit and habitable" condition under N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-42(a)(2).  Also under N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-42(a)(8)(h) failure to install or maintain an "operable" heating system capable of heating to ### ### ### and ### is considered an "### dangerous condition" that must be cured upon the landlord's "actual knowledge" of the defect and within a "reasonable time" following the landlord's knowledge.When the landlord is in breach for the violation of the implied warranty of habitability the tenant may sue in small claims court for what is called "rent ### adjustment of fair rental value for the months during which the habitability defect existed plus any specific special or consequential damages the tenant sustained as a direct result of the breach.  The small claims magistrate would have broad discretion in determining what amount the rent abatement should be based on the evidence the tenant produces on the day of the small claims court appearance.Note however that even when the landlord is in the wrong on the habitability issues the landlord cannot unilaterally withhold rent in North Carolina without a court order to do so.  So as long as you are staying in the rented apartment condo town home or house you need to still pay rent in full and if you do not the landlord can still sue in court to evict you although you will be able to counterclaim in that instance for breach of the implied warranty of habitability.  This will lessen the amount that the landlord can win against you in terms of monetary damages but it will have no effect whatsoever on the landlord's ability to have you evicted if rent has not been paid in full or if you have otherwise breached the lease on the tenant's side in some material way.The most beneficial way forward for both tenant and landlord is to negotiate a WRITTEN agreement about how this tenancy is to end early; note that verbal agreements are hard to prove in court when one side fails to honor his/her word and are not even enforceable at all if they are intended to override a written agreement made previously (such as the original lease agreement if there was one in writing).  Both parties have a reason to sue the other (unpaid rent for the landlord and habitability breaches for the tenant) so it is in both of your best interests to try to work this out privately; otherwise you will have to sue and countersue each other with the likelihood that judgments will be entered against you ### damages against the landlord and either a judgment for eviction judgment for money damages or a combination of both against you as the tenant.If needed the forms for a Complaint and Summons are at the Clerk of Superior Court's office at the local courthouse.  It costs $96.### and then $### Department.  I hope that this information is helpful to you.  See the below link if you wish to review N.C.G.S.

First, God bless you and your child as you still work through, even today, the emotional and spiritual consequences of this unfortunate incident.  This is very grievous to read, and only more so for you and your daughter to have experienced, I am certain.Yes, I think you should speak in person with a civil litigator to see about a lawsuit against the ### County School system.  I suspect that you will need to reach beyond ###, Waynesville, and ###, however, since local ties might dissuade even the best lawyers in those towns from taking on the same school system in which many of their friends and relatives are either administrators or teachers.  I suggest contacting a civil litigation lawyer in ### or ### (or both) to speak with you in a consultation. One of the main issues from the outset will be determining exactly when the three-year statute of limitations began ### the relationship with your daughter began or ended, or when the plea agreement was accepted.  Based on my limited knowledge of this situation (although your fact summary was well written and very helpful; thank you for that), I cannot tell you for sure, but since some of these dates are in the ###### range, you need to consult with litigation counsel as soon as possible (before Christmas if you can work it out), just in case you are close to your filing deadline.  One factor that might help you is that a lawyer might be able to argue that the statute of limitations period is tolled while your daughter is still a minor, which would give you a little more time to file a lawsuit, if your lawyer agrees with you that the legal disability of infancy" applies here since most of the claims and legal harms you would allege in a hypothetical lawsuit would be those accruing to your daughter as the victim of the defendants' wrongful conduct (both the school system and the teacher individually) rather than you.I would use ### "Find a Lawyer" search function and also contact (###) the Buncombe County Bar (###) the ### County Bar and (###) the Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association for referral sources.  To the best of my knowledge all of these resources are free.  You would then need to contact the lawyers on your ### and determine if any of them can consult with you on this matter.  Some lawyers might offer free consultations whereas others might charge anywhere from $### $### ### consultation.  If your case shows promise you can probably find a reputable lawyer who would take this on on a contingency basis (because if there is real promise of a settlement or jury or judge award the chances are guaranteed that both you and your lawyer will get paid since the school system has insurance for exactly these kinds of liability possibilities).Hope this is enough to get you started on the right path.  I wish you and your daughter much success in this and for your healing as you work towards a resolution of this matter.

I would contact the Greensboro office of Legal Aid of North Carolina, and see if one of their staff attorneys would send the landlord a final demand for payment in writing; this will likely be taken more seriously from the landlord if it comes from an attorney.  If that does not work, either you acting alone, or with the help of the Legal Aid attorney if one can represent you beyond sending the letter, should sue the landlord in small claims court for the refund amount.  I have copied and pasted the link to the contact information for the ### offices below:###I hope this will prove ### in achieving your goals.  Sorry you have had to wait so long to get your deposit!

My question is how do I proceed on filing to get my deposit back?43818.0083333333 Thank you same to you.43818.04375 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Assuming this is a landlord-tenant situation, your landlord MUST fix this problem within a reasonable time" of the landlord being informed by the tenant of this problem so if the landlord knew of this since mid October and has not adequately repaired it you have a very good case in small claims court for breach of the implied warranty of habitability (N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-4###).  You would likely be entitled to rent abatement for the months of November and December (and parts of October and January assuming you sue right after the holidays during January).  This would be the diminution of fair rental value of your residential premises due to the habitability defects proven through ### evidence.  If you could show personal injury or property damage you would likely be able to recover additional money damages though if you hope to combine this into a personal injury case you should also think of filing in District Court rather than small claims and using a personal injury lawyer to do so.  Note that the personal injury claims would not be supportable without sufficient ### records relating to the mold which a personal injury lawyer should examine before you try to assert such claims.Most likely your options are either (###) to settle a compromise with the landlord that either allows you to leave early or results in your having your rent lowered or you being paid a negotiated sum or (###) you sue in either small claims court or District Court (probably small claims) for rent abatement.  If you wish to be released from the current tenancy also you can ask for that in your civil complaint as well.The forms for small claims court are at the Clerk of Superior Court's office at the local courthouse.  You will need a civil complaint and a summons; it costs $96.### and then $### Office.  You would need to provide a physical address at which the landlord can be served.You have several sources you can use to consult or retain counsel for this matter.  First see if the ### office of Legal Aid of North Carolina would be interested in taking this case.  Links to the ### regional offices are below: ###Also consider using ### "Find a Lawyer" feature and searching for under the legal practice area of "Landlord and Tenant" in the ### area.  You will see the names of several if not more landlord-tenant lawyers whom you can contact.

Ordinarily, your household furniture would have been protected up to the value of $3,500.00.  Without exemption protections, this and anything else you own is fair game for execution.  Exemptions would have protected at least ###% of what you owned, whether valuable or not.43826.6368055556 Assets meaning money in bank or personal stuff like my TV's ###?43826.6347222222 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question, and I hope your holidays are going very well.  The specific answer to your question depends on the party or parties against ### the judgment was entered.  If you incorporated your business as an LLC or corporation before the lawsuit and the judgement is against the incorporated entity only, your personal assets are safe, but anything the business owns is fair game for the Sheriff to take through the judgment execution process.  If the judgment is either against just you personally, or it is against both the business and you personally, certain things you own might be seized, but in your personal case, you have to be served a Notice to Claim Exempt Property" before the judgement is executed and that will give you twenty (20) days to claim any exempt property eligible for exclusion under N.C.G.S. Chapter ###.  The form will describe what can and cannot be exempted and you can also read N.C.G.S. Chapter ### at ### and/or consult with a litigation lawyer for help on filling it out properly.  Anything not exempt that you own can be seized up to the amount of the judgment if there is a judgment against you personally.Most of your ### as your primary car (up to $######) your furniture (up to around $TERM00133### the last time I checked) and other things necessary for day-to-day living cannot be seized AS LONG AS you timely claim them in your form.  But keep in mind that if the judgment goes unpaid because you have nothing left to have seized above and beyond your exempted assets the judgment will dent your credit almost instantly (within thirty (###0) days in all likelihood) and can stay on the books for at least ten (10) years subject to a renewal for another ten (10) years.  So even if you protect your assets by using exemptions you still need to pay the judgment off as soon as possible.Note that there is no exemption for company assets in the same way that there is for personal assets.I hope this is helpful.  If a judgment has been entered against you personally be sure to be on the lookout for the Sheriff's "Notice to Claim Exempt Property which will be sent to you first before any execution efforts may lawfully begin.Have a blessed, safe, productive and ### ###.43825.7256944444 I have a painting business and completed 75% of work when I was told if I dont finish by the end of the week they will find someone who ### I was never going to finish so we left the owner filed for repayment of deposit from ### and won he then filed a small claims case and after presenting all my evidence and pictures the judge awarded them ###'t have the money to pay and have been told the sheriff's office will come and take what I have?43825.6083333333 I understand.

If you did not timely file the exemptions after receiving notice, all the questions you raised in your follow-up message are entirely at the will and discretion of the creditor.  The creditor may, but is not required to, accept installment plans for repayment.  You will have to work that out with the creditor.  The creditor's duty is to wait patiently until the debtor has had a chance under the statute to file exemptions.  Once that happens, the creditor may proceed full steam to seize assets, so long as the creditor works through the Sheriff and follows the protocols outlined in N.C.G.S. Chapter ###.  The debtor at this point runs out of any options.43825.93125 We received the notice to claim and didn't understand what it was we were under the impression that it would effect my credit but didn't in our ### dreams think they could come and take our stuff out of our house and there is no way we can pay off is there any way to make payment arrangements we also received a notice of levy they say they want full payment no payments excepted 43825.9284722222 Yeah I didn't understand the form thanks for your help 43826.6388888889 You do not have to claim" judgment proof; that will become ### if/when the creditor attempts to execute the judgment through the Sheriff and no assets are found.

I believe there is no fee for such filings, but if you desire legal representation in filing and the court hearing to get the order, contact either a family law or domestic violence attorney, who will know how to handle these cases (technically this is not a domestic violence" case but domestic violence attorneys will know how to do this well since they follow similar procedures for 50B protective orders which differ only slightly from the 50C order that is more applicable in your situation).### "Find a Lawyer" feature is a useful (and free) search tool for local attorneys in your town or city and also consider contacting the ### County Bar for information about referrals.

I see two aspects to this question: (###) breach of contract and (###) the status of the partnership.As for the breach of contract, you can sue your partner on this theory if needed, since the partnership agreement you presumably mutually signed can and will be enforced as any written contract can be in a court of law.  As for the dissolution, are we talking about a registered limited partnership, or a registered limited liability partnership?  Those are distinct.  Unless your partnership agreement says otherwise, dissolution can happen without a court order, under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###, which provides: The dissolution of a partnership is the change in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in the carrying on as ### from the winding up of the business."  The partners can of course stipulate different requirements for dissolution if they choose to do so in the written agreement but the default rule under this statutory provision is that when one of the partners wishes to end the partnership s/he can unilaterally do so (unlike a more formal entity such as an LLC or corporation).  Check your written agreement to see if there are any contradictory provisions to the general rule.You can sue for both breach of contract and judicial dissolution if the other partner will not sign the subsequent agreement that her attorney drafted but if you want to take the non-litigation approach and your current agreement allows for unilateral termination of the partnership provide written notice to the partner's attorney that you are ending the partnership and that you will need to work with that attorney to fairly split up all partnership assets once any creditors of your business have all been paid.  No final distributions of profits or partnership property should be made to the partners until all obligations to third parties have been ### with evidence of such satisfaction in writing.Should you desire the litigation route to resolving both the breach of contract and dissolution issues I think you will need a business litigator since doing this properly in District or Superior Court is going to be very difficult with legal expertise.  I hope that helps somewhat.  Please let me know if you need additional issues clarified.  Be well this year."43835.9479166667 I need to prepare a document to initiate a court ordered dissolution of a registered limited partnership.  My partner is in breach of contract (Partnership Agreement).  She will not sign the agreement prepared by her attorney and has not responded to my inquires.    43835.7826388889 In my opinion, you can do this if you are the only general partner, and the difficult person you speak of is the limited partner only.  The LP-###, not limited partners, so if you are the only general partner, you can unilaterally cancel registration with the Secretary under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###-84.2 (keep in mind that we are under Chapter ###, not 55, as you cited in your follow-up posting; the latter pertains to corporations).  I include a link to this provision immediately below:https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_###/GS_###-84.2.pdfIf both of you are general partners, you are probably stuck for the moment, until all general partners sign the form.  If that is the case, the attorney on the other side needs to get moving.  Either way, as a courtesy to the other side, and as a way to preempt any accusation that you were acting ### or in bad faith, notify the attorney ahead of time that you intend to file the LP-### (giving the side time to respond and take appropriate action if it intends to be helpful), assuming again that you are the only general partner.Sorry you are having to deal with such a headache as this.

I have had two family members pass away from prescription overdoses. You have several options in terms of legal remedies for both liability and money. You could pursue a wrongful death action, medical negligence, and a few other potential actions. I highly recommend you hire an attorney who handles these types of cases. I am happy to provide reputable referrals and will give you contact info below. If you pursue this on your own, you will likely face a wall of insurance lawyers. Additionally, in these types of situations an attorney handling your case will not require money upfront, instead they work on a contingency basis.

I am a mother of a deceased daughter who was brought to a pain management physician who was aware of the well documented facts wherein my daughter was treated by a previous pain doctor for her bone pain. My daughter was diagnosed with ### at age one.  The ### came out on the market and she was in remission from age ### 28.  The bone on bone pain an bone spurs in her knees and the joints in her ankles and wrists was unbearable so I brought her to a private pain physician and he gave her copious amounts of ###.  She became dangerously addicted to the ### and I overdosed and saved both at ### and ###.The pain had to be treated according to each rehab I spoke with and the drug rehabs would not accept her.    I brought her to another pain physician who was only supposed to treat her with methadone as it controls pain and. addiction, however, within one year he was prescibing additional medications including the ### she had been addicted to, he also added gabapentin and xanax and would also give her other ### when she ran out early.My daughter died of a toxic mix of these medications according to the ME report.  We will hit the two year statute of limitations this coming ###, ###.Please keep in mind that the negligence is due to the fact the 2nd pain management physician knew she had an addiction to ### and xanax and prescribed them ###I hope to hear from you..  I have to live with the crushing guilt and have had additional physical problems since my only child died at age ###.  She :was due to have full knee replacements in the fall at ### per a consultation with an orthopaedic physician and she was in good spirits and looking forward to being able to walk around for exercise and return to her career in radio.  Her life was cut short due to the neglect of her physician and I am half dead from her loss.  I truly hope you can point me in the right direction.  ###,TERM010###1 ######-### 43836.9493055556 Hi, ###,I'm so sorry for your boy.   Take some time to consider - what do you want to happen and what do you want to happen for your son?  Do you want the dog deemed dangerous?  Do you want to file criminal charges against your father and/or stepmother for the attack?  Do you want you son's medical expenses paid for?  Just his past medical expenses or for his ongoing treatment?  If so, what about his future plastic surgery or surgeries?  What about any, if you deem necessary, counseling or therapy for his fear and trauma?   Do you want criminal charges filed? According the NC statutory law, a dangerous dog" is a dog that (###) without provocation has killed or inflicted severe injury on a person; or (###) is determined by the person ... authority responsible for animal control to be potentially dangerous because the dog has engaged in one or more of the behaviors listed in subdivision (###) of this subsection (below).Subdivision (###) defines a "potentially dangerous dog" to mean a dog that the person or ... authority responsible for animal control determines to have as applicable here inflicted a bite that resulted in broken bones or disfiguring lacerations or required cosmetic surgery or hospitalization.Possessing a dangerous dog who attacks another person causing over $###00.### ###.  Leaving a dangerous dog unattended on the owner's property (without being in a secure fence or inside) is a class ###.  There may be other applicable charges.If you want criminal charges filed -- who would they be filed against?  Your father?  Your stepmom?  Both of them?If the attack occurred in ### County you can contact the prosecuting attorney's office.  If you had a police report filed I would follow up with the report number with the police and/or the prosecuting attorney's office.Do you want Animal Enforcement to deem the dog "dangerous dog" or request that it be euthanized?If the attack occurred in ### County you can contact their Animal Enforcement department for information on how to proceed.  https://www.###countync.gov/###7###/Animal-Enforcement  They may refer you to the county's Department of Health.### County's ordinances outline generally the procedure for requesting a dog be deemed dangerous.  It will likely involve some sort of complaint notice to the dog's owners and possibly a hearing or hearings.  You can find the ordinance here.  https://library.municode.com/nc/###_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=COOR_CH5AN_ARTIIANCO_DIV###GE_S5-39DADOPODADODEPR If the dog is deemed dangerous the ordinance requires particular fencing roofing locks and signage.  If those requirements aren't fulfilled there can be citations and penalties from the county's health director or animal services director to the dog's owner.  If the attack did not occur in ### County look up the Animal Enforcement department of that county and their local ordinances.  Have you spoken with your father and/or stepmother about their homeowner's insurance to cover your son's medical expenses?Sometimes homeowner's insurance will cover injury to guests.  It may be that their homeowner's insurance covers dog bites.  If so you should speak with them about filing a claim.  If the homeowner's insurance is unwilling to cover your son's injuries unwilling to pay you sufficient funds or if your father and/or stepmother are unable or unwilling to help you with the insurance process you may choose to file suit.Do you want to file suit to recover your son's past and ongoing medical expenses his pain and suffering future plastic surgery and (if you deem necessary) the cost of therapy?  If you choose to sue NC law states that the owners of dangerous dogs will be strictly liable for injuries inflicted by that dog.  Which means liability is imposed on the dog's owner without a finding of fault.  This standard may make it somewhat easier to prove your case.  Consider if you file suit you will sue your father and/or stepmother.  If they have homeowner's insurance however their homeowner's insurance may provide their legal representation. If you only want to sue for $###0000.###'s small claims court (also known as magistrate court).  However some counties may have a cap of $### however so call the county court clerk's office to be sure. If you would like to sue for more than $###0000.### for example your son's pain and suffering future plastic surgery or future therapy costs you would file in District Court if the amount you're asking for is less than $TERM00065###.  For more than $###5000.###.  If your son's doctors recommend plastic surgery consider that plastic surgery is costly.Of course as your demand for monetary damages increases so does the complexity of the court proceeding.  In small claims court for example it would be easier to represent yourself (also known as "pro se") because the process is designed for lay people to represent themselves.  If you would like to read more about the small claims process and learn about what forms you would need to file visit this site:  ###  If you decide to proceed for more than $###00 you will have to proceed in District or Superior Court.  In those courts you will be treated the same as an attorney and will be bound to the Rules of Civil Procedure and Rules of Evidence.  As such it would be difficult to represent yourself in district or superior court.  Without knowing the complete facts of this attack it seems that you might be better served hiring an attorney and proceeding in District or Superior Court.It is a possibility a plaintiff's attorney would take your case (especially if your father and/or stepmother have some type of potentially applicable insurance).  I recommend contacting a plaintiff's attorney in your area.  Most have experience with dog attack cases.  Most will provide a free consultation to discuss the strength of your case.  They typically do not require upfront payment but rather their fee will be 30-40% of whatever you might recovery from the suit.  Some plaintiff's attorneys will initially cover the costs of filing fees fees in obtaining records like medical records and other case related fees - but some will require you to pay them at the time the cost is incurred or shortly thereafter.  More likely any case associated costs or fees would be added on top of the attorney's 30-40% fee once the case resolved.I recommend you contact a plaintiff's attorney should you choose to sue.  There are fairly complex causes of action related to a dog bite case including causes like negligence negligence per se scienter and/or contributory negligence. Think about what you want to happen for your son and your relationship with your ###.  I recommend you consult a plaintiff's attorney soon to discuss every detail of the attack - they can likely help you with both the homeowner's insurance process and if necessary the lawsuit.Best of luck and I'm very sorry for your son.  Continue to take pictures and video throughout his treatment and recovery.  "43838.6923611111 Sunday night my ###.

Your question raises the issue of what constitutes a valid gift under North Carolina law.  It comprises three things: (###) donative intent by the donor; (###) delivery of the gift from donor to donee; and (###) acceptance of the gift by the donee.  If there was no specification that these items were to be loaned it is presumed by law that the items were indeed gifts.  If the gifts were intended for the young child, it is the legal and moral duty for the custodians of that child to use the items consistent with the purpose for which they were offered in the first ### this case, to provide for the care and maintenance of the child.  Unless the person told you on the front end that she expected the items back at a certain time, they are not loaned, but gifted items.Her remedies would be ###, although neither would be very effective: (###) sue in small claims for either return of the items or for their monetary value, and/or (###) report the items as stolen to law enforcement.  Option (###) is weak because she would not be able to prove that she conditioned the transfer of the items upon an explicit understanding that the they would be returned; Option (###) is weak because police generally do not get involved in domestic, he said she said" situations and will typically tell people "that's a civil matter so we should not get involved."  While the other person might be able to cause you a little stress and headache over this if she truly gifted the items nothing legal will come of whatever she might threaten to do.  Just make sure your actions are in the right with respect to the items and you will be fine.Hopefully you will not have to deal with any nonsense over this and can just live your life in peace.  I hope that ### safe rewarding and productive for you and your family.  Be well."43838.8569444444 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.

My mental state ### suffered. Ive been on heavy medication and was hospitalized amd basically put of it for a year.Any suggestions Just Google his name43843.8791666667 Good afternoon,I pray this message finds you well. I looked over your question and I did some research and my findings are below:Suing the Housing Development A wrongful death claim is a type of negligence claim that may be brought when the negligence of someone or some entity results in the death of another. Typically, for negligence, you must show that the party whom the action was brought against had a duty to the person who died, the party breached their duty and the breach of that duty resulted in the death of the person.In NC, landowners have certain duties to those on their premises depending on the reasons for the person being on the premises. If a person is on a landowner's property for business (wherein the landowner is profiting from the person being on the premises), the landowner owes that person a duty to make the premises safe. Further, the landowner may be liable if the breach of that duty results in the person being injured.Here, the problem that we run into is causation. if you move forward with a claim against the housing development, you must have sufficient evidence to show that the housing development has had numerous incidents where there has been dangerous criminal activity that has occurred on their premises. This will show that they had notice that dangerous criminal activity was frequently occurring but they did nothing to make safe the development (like hire security guards or put up a gate or something). Only by showing that the development had previous occurrences of dangerous criminal activity could it be proved that the housing development could foresee the harm that came to your son. This would satisfy the causation portion for a wrongful death negligence claim against the development.Honestly, it would be a tough case to prove but it could be done. I think that could be a suit that could be brought. If you have any such evidence about the housing development then definitely seek an attorney to take on the case. If not, honestly, it will be a tough case to prove.Suit against Parents of the Accused In NC, and other states, parents are not responsible or liable for the torts of their children. Thus, although a child may have committed a crime and even if they are below the age of majority and the parent does have legal custody of the child, the parent is still not held liable for the wrongs or crimes of their children.I'm sorry this has happened. I hope this is somewhat helpful.43847.6881944444 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for this question, and I hope that besides this issue with your sorority, your life and academic progression is otherwise highly ###.  This is a tough one, but I think there are ways to better ascertain the answers you are seeking.  I would first examine the bylaws of your local chapter and see if there is any language regarding fines and assessments, as well as whether/when the board of your chapter can impose the same.  I realize that you said you do not know of a written document but there have to be bylaws.  I cannot imagine a Greek organization having a local chapter without governing bylaws.  If you cannot find bylaws, I would suggest going up the ladder to your regional (or if needed, national) level of your organization, to see what legal guidance they can provide.  Lastly, your ### of Students, Greek Life Coordinator, or some other senior leader in student affairs can speak with you and provide helpful guidance.I think the answer to your question is very likely to come from either (###) your sorority's internal bylaws, or (###) the student affairs regulations of your institution (with a strong tendency toward (###) ).  I know that this is not a comprehensive treatment of your issue, but in the absence of knowing your organizational governance protocols, this is about as much as any lawyer can responsibly provide.I hope this helps nonetheless.  Please be safe and productive this semester; I wish you success in achieving your most ### dreams.43844.1638888889 Hi I am apart of a national sorority on a private university campus. We are currently preparing for recruitment and various girls have been issued fines for missing recruitment practices. Many of the reasons are valid, will not be on campus due to physical and/or mental health problems requiring them to be home" "evicted from university housing with no local housing available" "will not be present for recruitment due to an abroad program and was already told that they would not be charged". Some girls are missing recruitment practices for much less reasonable reasons yet they are not being fined. Many of these entailed "decided to not take a course over the universities one month long winter ### and instead stay home". There is no written document explicitly defining reasons for fines from our sorority on a national or chapter basis. Furthermore we have little visibility as to where the money from these fines are being allocated and we had no representation in deciding a reasonable price for a fine. My main concern here is the practice of fining members based off of no written or agreed upon document outlining valid reasons for absences. My main question is whether sorority members in positions of power have the legal right to fine other sorority members for actions deemed "unexecuted". While this appears outrageous it opens the question as to what else we can be fined on. Could we be fined for wearing yellow on Wednesday? Or for talking to members of another organization? Or anything under sun considering there are no explicitly written rules or bylaws other than vague emails that appear to be inconsistent?

If the morphine did cloud your judgment, there is a question as to if you were of sound mind to be able to give consent to the procedure that was performed.

Since I was given morphine do I have a right to file a law suit? 43844.1847222222 If you can prove the establishment did something negligent to cause your father harm then they could potentially be held liable for his medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages, future medical bills, etc.  The basic elements of a slip and fall claim are:A dangerous condition existed on the premises;The condition was such that the owner of the premises knew or should have known that it existed;The owner failed to correct the condition; andAs a result of the condition you suffered injury.However these types of cases can be tricky because there are certain defenses to liability that are almost always raised by the establishment and their insurance carrier's attorneys.  For example, if the fall was due to a spill on the floor, was the spill open and obvious" to someone if they were reasonably paying attention.  Did the injured person "contribute" to the fall (for example if someone was highly intoxicated at a bar or the like) which could be a complete bar to recovery.  Also it is often vital to try and lock down evidence early.  Getting contact information of any witnesses sending a "###" letter to make sure the establishment doesn't destroy vital evidence such as video tapes taking photos of the area etc.  This website is really meant to respond to legal questions so it is not an "attorney finder" site but you likely want to consult with an attorney in the ### County area who handles "slip and fall" and/or "premises liability" type case to go into further details and see if based on your fathers specific facts you have a case above the medicals worth pursuing.

You may want to speak to a criminal defense attorney and explain fully the circumstances of your father's permission to drive your vehicle, your knowledge, or lack thereof, of his driving intoxicated on the day in question and any prior knowledge or lack thereof of his driving intoxicated and/or prior DWI charges.  The question typically ### around whether you knew OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN that your father was getting behind the will of your vehicle while intoxicated. These cases can be very  complicated and fact specific.    Because of the wrongful death though, you should at least consult with a local criminal defense attorney. Given the vehicle was yours, you could potentially be sued by the personal representative of the  estate of the deceased driver.  If your vehicle was insured, your insurance carrier would have to provide a legal defense.  They would not likely hire a defense attorney unless and until you are actually sued.

I need to know what kind of trouble I can get into, if any. 43857.8618055556 Also, it doesn't  matter whether you are a resident of ### County.  In North Carolina a Plaintiff can file a lawsuit in the county where they live or where any of the Defendants live.  So likely the reason this suit was filed in ### County is because that is where the Plaintiff lives or one of the other defendants.43859.6625 I have never been a MD or lived in ### County.43859.6375 I received a court summons with my name listed and it was done in error.They have me listed as an MD which I am not. I have already viewed the documents.What should I do next? 43859.6368055556 You are listed as a defendant in this law suit.  It looks like it may be some type of medical malpractice case.  There should have been a complaint enclosed as well that explains what the lawsuit is about.  It should explain what the Plaintiff is alleging your role in the lawsuit was.   If you were involved somehow in the case as an employee of any of the other listed defendants or in some other way, you will need to consult with an attorney.  If you were an employee of one of the other defendants then talk to your employer who will likely already have a defense attorney who may represent you as well and can advise you going forward.  Even if the employer's attorney doesn't represent you as well, they may help you find your own separate attorney.If this is a case of mistaken identity (i.e. you literally had nothing to do with this case at all and they just served the wrong person with the summons), then you may want to  contact the Plaintiff's attorney and let them know they've made a mistake.  However if you are involved in this case you should NOT contact the plaintiff's lawyers if you are involved somehow in the case, regardless of whether they were wrong about you being an MD. 43859.6597222222 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  You have a mess on your hands.  First, you need to read the Complaint and determine what claims at law or in equity the father is pursuing against you and/or the company you run, and second, your company might have a claim against the partner for taking company funds and misusing them for personal use.  This is going to be a very complicated ### with a bankruptcy in the mix, which might stay certain civil proceedings in state court, given that bankruptcy is in federal court, and the federal bankruptcy judge has the power to issue stays of state court litigation when a Suggestion of Bankruptcy" is filed.  It is going to take your working with a civil litigator to make sense of this.  You can start with a consultation on the matter and then see whether you can afford a civil litigator to defend you in this suit.  Defending yourself in a case like this will be very difficult without legal counsel and impossible as to your business if the business is both an incorporated entity and a defendant in this case (in NC corporate entities must retain legal counsel for litigation matters in state court).Check ### "Find a Lawyer" feature to search for business/civil ### in and around ### and you can also reach out to the New ### County Bar Association for possible referrals.  I hope you can work something out with counsel to get you through this lawsuit in good shape.

They found him not guilty despite his own recorded confession, internal affairs finding him Guilty, etc. he was found not guilty because a â€œtechnicalityâ€ the officers who wrote the summons did not fill it out correctly (on purpose, so he wouldnâ€™t be convicted) and that criminal summons error allowed him to get off ### simply because he resigned.

There are plenty of people you can be friends or companions with.  43864.9895833333 Good evening, Mr. Pigeon:Thank you for your question.  The answer to these questions constitute more practical advice than legal advice.  Although there is apparently no court order in this situation, to be safe, you should assume for your own good that you should never talk to this young lady again unless she clearly indicates to you that your overtures or communications to her will be welcome; and even after that point, you should still be on your guard.Just assume that no contact is literally meant--whether by in-person encounter, email, text, social media message, letter, fax, call, or anything else.  Err on the side of caution, and do not test your boundaries given that law enforcement already has something of a paper trail on this matter.  That will keep you on the right side of the law, and preclude your being charged with criminal stalking, bullying, harassment, etc.  If you do not go looking for trouble, trouble will probably not come looking for you.I hope that ###, productive and rewarding year for you.  Be well.43864.9291666667 Hello! On ###th I had two police officers show up at my door and they told me that I couldnâ€™t contact this girl anymore. And I understand that I canâ€™t contact her. But I have multiple other questions like, how would we ever talk to each other again if we decided that we did want to start talking to each other again if she was told she couldnâ€™t contact me and I was told I couldnâ€™t contact her by a police officer. If we both mutually wanted to start talking to each other again and had some agreement on it how would we even go about that? And am I able to message her or talk to her even once. And what about following on social media? She didnâ€™t go to court for it, just called the police and they said for us not to contact anymore.43864.9076388889 I am helping you, you just do not appreciate it because it does not cohere with what you wish to believe--a common solecism that we lawyers see when people come to us with problems.  I am trying to be as respectful and patient with this dialogue, but at this point there is not much else to discuss.  You do not have any legal options; the cops were totally entitled to do what they did, and you have no recourse to challenge the prohibition they imposed.  Just because you were told something you do not like or believe is unfair does not mean that you have legal options."  Your option is to comply or not and risk criminal sanction.  Please stop making what is simple complicated.  Move on with your life.  Life is short so make each day count.  There is nothing for you to do to change this situation.  With all ### God bless you this year."43865.0340277778 I answered this already.  Don't send the text asking if you can contact her again, and neither of you should contact each other, period.  It really is that simple if you do not want the cops to come see you again.43864.9868055556 I get that! but I am asking what I legally can do. I know there are many others, I know that there is a way to contact again if we both wish to. And you aren't helping me. You are basically just telling me what to do, and not telling me what my legal options are.43865.0090277778 I stand on my original answer--just make it easy on yourself and stop contacting the woman, period.  This makes perfect sense.  Keep yourself out of trouble and find other people for ###, companionship, etc.  This is not worth putting yourself in a situation where there can be misunderstandings that result in your being charged with a crime (even if it is a relatively minor one).  Once a charge is placed on your record, it usually stays there for a very long time.  This is not worth it.  Best wishes to you, again.43864.9625 Okay I understand what you are saying. But that isn't what I am asking. I am asking if I could ever contact them and send one single text message asking them if I can start talking to them again. And if we did want to start talking again how would we even do this if the police officer told both me and her to stop contacting each other?43864.9694444444 Please read the prior responses.  I have already answered this multiple times, and am now closing the question. Nothing personal or disrespectful, but I have done the best to explain what is a very simple, straightforward situation.  I sincerely wish you the best in all aspects of your life.  Take care, and be well.43865.04375 So I couldnâ€™t send a message to the lady asking her if it is okay for me to speak to her again? She was told she canâ€™t contact me either so how would she tell me that I can start talking to her again. Just doesnâ€™t make since to me.43864.9465277778 So thereâ€™s literally no way at all to ever talk to this person again if we both mutually agreed and wanted to start contacting again how would any of us know? What would we do. 43864.9888888889 So we could never contact each other ever again even if we wanted to even though this didnâ€™t even make it to court we still can just never contact again if we mutually agree to start contacting again is what you are saying?43865.0395833333 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question, and I hope you are well.  Since there is no rental agreement and this person has probably been in your home for a while, I suggest that you give the person a written notice (typewritten and signed, with you having a copy as evidence in case you need to produce it later) to vacate within ten (###0) days, with the warning that you will sue for summary ejectment in small claims court if the person does not comply with your demand.  If the person does not vacate by the effective date, you can first call the police to see if they will remove the person, but sometimes the police will treat this as a landlord-tenant matter despite there not being a lease, and will ask that you first sue in small claims court.If that happens, you would need to go to the Onslow County Clerk of Court at the courthouse, and ask for a Complaint for Summary Ejectment and a summons.  It costs $96.###, and $###0.###.  You would fill out the appropriate spaces in the complaint and summons, and do at least three (###) copies--one of which will be on file permanently with the court, the other two to be served on the person, and retained by you for your own records, respectively.  The Clerk will normally assign a court date to take place within two (###) weeks of the filing date, which would be the day on which you would need to appear before the magistrate and tell him/her about the situation and why the person needs to be evicted.  There are four grounds listed on the complaint for ejectment: (###) nonpayment of rent; (###) breach of the lease; (###) criminal activity on the premises; and (###) holdover status.  Based on the limited information I have about your particular situation, it sounds like holdover status would be the most correct description of your grounds for suing, since the person would have held over" past the date in your ten-day ### to vacate.If the trial in front of the magistrate (likely to take only ### although you may have to wait a little longer before it is your turn to speak) is relatively simple and straightforward you should be given a judgment of possession by the magistrate.  The person if s/he appeared will have ten (###0) days to appeal.  If s/he appeals and loses or if no appeal is filed at all you can then go to the Sheriff and pay $55.### which the Sheriff will then execute within three to five days.  If necessary the deputy sheriff who arrives will forcibly evict the person from the premises.This is a brief sketch of the overall eviction process in North Carolina.  From beginning to end it can last between two to four weeks depending on the circumstances and how the person to be evicted responds to each stage in the process.God bless you this ###0###0 which I hope will be a rewarding year for you."43865.0548611111 I have someone in my house that has no rental agreement! I want to know what I need to do legally to get him out?43864.9472222222 I really appreciate that, Mr. ###.  I hope this situation can get resolved without a lot of headache.

If your charge was ultimately dismissed and you have no other felony convictions on your record, you are likely eligible to pursue an expunction under NC General Statute 15A-156.Please note the following criteria for an expunction of a dismissed charge:Felony charge or misdemeanor charge was disposed of by a dismissal, finding of not guilty, or finding of not responsible.Multiple charges may be expunged.A previous expunction does not disqualify a person from expunging a subsequent criminal record.Petitioner has not been convicted of a felony.*If your dismissal was pursuant to a deferral program, you will either be required to pay $###.The appropriate petition form for this type of expunction can be found at nccourts.org/forms. The form number is ###. To file for an expunction, you will have to fill out this form and take it to the criminal clerk of court at the courthouse where the original court case was heard. The clerk of court will get the judge to sign the form. At the time of the first signature, the judge is not making a decision about whether to grant the petition for  expunction but, instead, is authorizing or allowing the process to move forward. The clerk will mail the signed petition form to the NC Administrative Office of the Courts and to the State Bureau of Investigation who will help research your complete record and mail it back to the judge so she/he can determine whether you are eligible for the expunction. If you are eligible and meet the criteria above, the judge will grant your expunction and the expunction order will be sent to the clerk of court and law enforcement offices so they can destroy their records. Please note that the entire expunction process can take several months.One option to you is to call Legal Aid of North Carolina to request assistance in the preparation of your expunction petition. To do that, you will need to call their intake line at 1-66-219-LANC or apply online for their services here: ###43874.0159722222 In March of ### ###. I did a first time defender program and I had to turn in a certificate and my case was dismissed but now I want to get it expunged but I see that the statues are for age ###.

I havenâ€™t been convicted of anything and nor have I been charged with anything. 43865.8555555556 Hey there. So Ive got a situation that I need legal advice on.

It is a pleasure to serve, and I wish I could offer something more to your liking.  I really appreciate your courtesy and professionalism as well.  God bless you and your family richly this year.43868.2430555556 Awesome.  Good thoughts!43868.2715277778 Hello, Ms. ###:Your concerns about fairness are very understandable here, but this is not worth a complaint to the Senior Resident District Court Judge, or the Judicial Standards Commission; in fact, judges make changes like this periodically, in their discretion, and are allowed to do this even if upon a suggestion by a lawyer who is no longer a counsel of record in the case.  While what remains from here is uncertain, I would not at this point make any conclusion that the judge has acted unethically--at least, that does not appear in the facts here.Also, in local legal communities, the judges and lawyers ALWAYS know of one another, as they regularly attend monthly or quarterly ###, social events and holiday parties, etc., as a local bar association.  Any District Court judge who sits in the same district where the lawyer in question primarily practices, will know all the lawyers who regularly appear in District Court.  That is true in any county in North Carolina.  I hope your case goes well, and is ultimately resolved with a fair and just result.  Best wishes and blessings to you in ###.43867.2847222222 Ms. ###:I am sorry to hear of these unpleasant experiences in this particular judge's courtroom.  You can possibly move for the judge to be recused, and that motion would be heard by another judge, but I seriously doubt that will happen.  I also do not believe the judge will be disciplined, but if you believe you have a case of actual wrongdoing by the judge, that is what the Judicial Standards Commission is for; just be sure that you can point to specific instances in which the judge violated the Code of Judicial Conduct in North Carolina.  Most complaints of this kind that are filed are dismissed.Nonetheless, I wish you the best in your cause.43868.0513888889 Thank you for your response. That incident is just the most recent thing the judge did. The judge has done much more. He put a minor child with mental disabilities in the home of a stranger(defendant) that has NEVER paid child support or cared for the child period who is 9.###/home state with no just case or evidence to support it. In fact the judge stated I was not unfit and a good mother. With that said, the minor child previously been arrested under fake charges, touched sexually and inappropriately by a peer, taken put of regular therapy and of her medication, alienated from her family and much more. All evidence provided to the judge was ignored and he ruled on hearsay that was untrue. These things mentioned still do not cover everything that's been done. I realize judges will know attorneys however they are not to be in positions that question their impartiality. If any reasonable person has cause to question the judges ability to be impartial, the judge needs to recuse themselves and that was not the case here. The connection with the attorney is just one of many that the judge has with people very close to the case and on the defendants side. ### also began ruling in favor of the defendant once his attorney was retained. But the attorney did absolutely nothing and produced no evidence. The attachments from the Judicial Standards Commission was from a previous complaint on even more unethical and inappropriate things done by the judge.43867.625 Thank you. I did that before and he laughed at me. I'm going to refile it and a motion to change ###. There are too many people in the court tied to this case & witnesses of the defendant. It's impossible to get a fair hearing in ### or any neighboring counties. He's using my inability to affordan attorney against me. After all I've been put through with this judge, I'm losing all respect for the courts. They're supposed to uphold the law and protect children. But no matter what I'm going to keep fighting. Who knows, maybe I'll find someone to take the case Pro Bono. The year's just started so someone has to have hours to complete. I just have to find them! But thank you so much for taking the time to answer my question and respond to my other messages. It's greatly appreciated!43868.2375 There is a show ### hearing because the defendant keeps violating the order. The plaintiff and  defendant are Pro Se. The defendant did not appear but the plaintiff could continue, per the judge. The judge receives an email from the defendants previous attorney making an excuse for them. The judge shows the plaintiff. The email and court order in place confirm this attorney is no longer the attorney on this case. The judge then tells the plaintiff they cannot proceed and that another date had to be set. Can a judge legally change what he said like that, especially from an email from someone who is not an active attorney on the case?It's worth mentioning the judge and attorney have a relationship outside of the courtroom and they both are connected heavily to the defendants side. This judge has also been investigated by the Judicial Standards Commission for other wrong/unethical behaviors. I need to determine if this incident is inappropriate so I can report it correctly.43867.1194444444 What you said helped more than you know. Thank you again. God will bless us. I don't understand why I'm going through this but He makes no mistakes. I pray your ###. 43868.26875 Good evening, Mr. ###:I am very sorry at what happened, and by the pictures you attached, I know that the damage to both person and property (eyeglasses) is real.  While I do sincerely believe that a consultation with a personal injury lawyer will be necessary to say for certain whether you have a valid case against the owner of the lot where you fell, I will note a couple things first.If the curb was in good condition as to structural integrity, it may not be enough to argue in a lawsuit that its being deceptive" in its appearing flat by itself is sufficient to impose liability on the owner.  If the kind of curb you fell on is a standard curb that appears in similarly situated parking decks commercial ### etc across the state and country that is within the "reasonable standard" that the owner may rely upon in planning the area and will not lead to liability because a ### may occasionally fall on it.  If however the design of the curb can be ### argued to be inherently dangerous no matter how careful a reasonably prudent ### may be then that would strengthen your argument that the premises owner should be liable.  That will be a hard fight to have but if you can find a lawyer who agrees with that it might be worth an attempt to assert a claim.This website is designed to answer questions and provide limited guidance to people on how to handle legal issues in their lives but is not designed for us to actually take the cases of the people whose questions we answer.  However if your case shows promise of leading to a worthwhile claim it will not be difficult to find a personal injury lawyer who would take it on and contact the lot owner's insurance company in order to settle a claim (or litigate it in the unlikely alternative that nothing can be worked out).Vetting a claim and ascertaining its precise monetary value is the work of a lawyer actually consulting with you and being retained by you following the consultation.  Thankfully the vast majority of personal injury lawyers will offer an initial consultation for either free or low cost and will then work with you on a contingency basis if they agree to take your case.  I suggest using ### "Find a Lawyer" feature and also searching the lists of lawyers on the Greensboro Bar Association website at this link:https://www.greensborobar.org/member-directory/#!directory/ord=lnmHopefully this will get you to one or more lawyers with an interest in talking with you further.

In what county did you get this ticket--was it ### or some other county?  Depending on where it was issued, I may be able to recommend a good traffic lawyer for you.  I can respond either way and let you know.  In case I do not know of someone who regularly appears in the relevant county, I would also recommend going to ### and doing a Find a Lawyer" search based on the towns cities nearby under the practice area "Speeding & Traffic Ticket."

I am glad that you responded however as I was hoping I could provide a personal recommendation.  I hope this goes well for you."43868.9840277778 My ticket was in Bertie County . If you can recommend a lawyer that would be great ! Thank you 43868.9645833333 Good afternoon, Ms. Yelverton:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  I am very sorry that you are experiencing pain and inconvenience in your life due to these surgery-related matters.  Medical malpractice is always a very hard thing to predict or analyze from the distance of a website forum like this one, but fortunately for you, many medical malpractice lawyers will meet with you for an initial consultation (usually for ###) either for free or low cost.  To be honest with you, it is impossible to say whether your case against your surgeon is strong without your having the benefit of an in-person discussion with a medical malpractice lawyer who has also had the benefit of at least a cursory review of your medical records.  After such a consultation, the medical malpractice lawyer should be able to develop a clear idea of whether a case can be made against the doctor, and if so, what the approximate value of your claim would likely be.  The lawyer can also project costs for court filing fees, discovery and expert witnesses, which the lawyer's firm would front for you as part of a contingency fee arrangement that would be reduced to a signed writing between you and the firm.You can find many excellent medical malpractice lawyers using ### Find a Lawyer" feature (a free resource).  You can also contact the Wake County Bar Association and see if they offer free referrals in the medical malpractice area (not sure whether they do but this is still an idea to pursue).

Assuming that you are still suing the person who caused your accident in your second case and it is their statement, then the answer is likely yes. Rule of Evidence ###. That rule also specifically ### out an exception for statements of a party opponent, allowing those statements to be admitted into evidence so long as they comply with other rules of evidence such as relevance and not being unduly prejudicial. If these statements were not made by a party opponent then you're on thinner ice, but if they were given in the previous case under oath, such as at a deposition or while the person was on the witness stand, you can still likely use them in your re-filed case. Whether or not the statement is in the court record is less important than the independent admissibility of the statements, which based on your statements, seem strong enough to make it into evidence. Can you use the recording you took of the police officer at the scene in court? This is a slightly complicated question and the answer essentially boils down to maybe. Whether the recording is usable in court depends on what you're seeking to use the statement for and also depends on your ability to authenticate the recording. I'll briefly discuss each of these issues in turn.Authenticating the recording. You'll need to have a witness that can authenticate the voice on the recording as that of the officer who created the accident report/took the report. This witness could be the officer himself or another person who knows the officers voice from interactions with the officer that are unrelated to your case. Experience gained with the voice for the purposes of your case does not work. This is Rule of Evidence ###.How you use the recording. Once you've authenticated the recording you will be able to use it only for a select few purposes. You won't be able to just throw it into evidence as substantive proof that you were in fact injured. However, you could use the statement while cross-examining the officer on the witness stand as an inconsistent statement. You would have to first conduct an examination of the officer, or hope the other side does so, wherein the officer states that you didn't go directly to the hospital or tell him that you were heading straight there. Once that statement was made you could then introduce this recording, assuming of course it has been or immediately is authenticated, showing that you had in fact told him you were going to the hospital and then ask him to explain the inconsistencies in his testimony. Also, if the opposing side has the accident report itself admitted into evidence as a public record you could likely seek to call the officer as a witness and ask him questions about that report's inconsistencies and likely reference your recording as proof to the contrary/impeachment evidence while doing so, again only once it has been authenticated.Is there a database where attorneys report that they have rejected a person as a client? No. There is no database where the number of times you have been turned down as a client is reported. Finally, some admittedly unsolicited advice. If several attorneys have turned down your case, they either all see a weakness in your case that leads them to do so or they may simply not see any way to make any money on your case. If you've been requesting that they take your case on a contingency basis and the financial settlement or judgment will be too small to justify the amount of work necessary to try to win the case, they will likely turn down your case even if they think they could win it. To get around this problem you could offer to pay an hourly rate for their time, but that would likely be very, very expensive, and you could of course still lose at trial or during the pre-trial motions practice, so I would be extremely hesitant to go this route.Trials are complicated and difficult processes for even experienced attorneys to successfully carry out. I would encourage you in the strongest terms to continue seeking an attorney to assist you in litigating yours rather than atempting to do so pro se.Also, please recall that having dismissed your case once already, assuming you took a voluntary dismissal pursuant to Rule ###, the next time you file your case will be your last chance to bring your case. If you file and then voluntarily dismiss this case again the dismissal will be WITH prejudice, meaning you can't ever refile your case unless the court makes a special exception to this general rule.I hope this has been helpful. 43872.8020833333 I have an admitted statement from the person who caused the vehicle accident I was involved in and injured in and it is on a previous court record, I filed pro se but dismissed on my own due to the pain from my injury interfering with how I handled the case and the court would not let me have a continuance to deal with the injury or allow me to transfer locally even with knowing I by doctors orders I could not drive from Greenboro to ### County due to the injury (the case was filed there at the time but I had to move to Greensboro due to housing related issues). I just wanted to know can this statement from court (or anything filed in that previous court record) be used as evidence in a new court proceeding without the defense attorney getting it struck from the record. Also can a recording of the police officer conversation with me at the scene of the accident be used in court to prove that the accident report differs from what I stated to the officer at the scene of the acccident including the fact he left out of the accident report record that I stated I was injured and was going to the hospital from the scene as soon as he released me from the scene. North Carolina is a one party consent state, I know that much and I recorded the officer because while he was talking to the other driver he seemed friendly with him so I felt that he may try to ease the record for the other driver and I recorded him because I felt I was gonna be treated unfairly and the report is proof that the officer disregarded my statement of injury at the scene, and the impact was harder that ###, it was a hard hit. I now have a Spinal Cord Stimulator for the constant lower back pain and the ### pain in m left leg. I also have a loss of strength and motion in my left leg from the accident. One last thing is there a data base of people who seek attorney help showing how many times they have been turned down? because its weird that a website stated that if other attorneys turn someone down others will also do the same as well. I did not tell every attorney that I was turned down but they immediately turned my case down. Doesn't mean I will just give up. My statue of ### has not run out and I have an injury and the other driver caused it; his insurer, his lawyer, and the police officer at the scene admit this fact and he is the proximate cause of my injury because I never had any of these medical issues before the accident occured. My life has affected in a major way with this injury, I will not give up the fight.  43871.9152777778 Thank you for those answers.43872.8229166667 I just filed paid for an appeal on a small claims case and no one at the clerk of courts could advise when I should go to court.The documents given back to me with a case number DOES NOT" state when to go to court.I understand that they at the clerk of courts can't help me with legal matters but there should be some kind of documentstating when I should go to court to appeal my case.Any help in this matter would be very helpful....thank you"43873.84375 Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  I must admit that this is a little odd; your thinking is correct that there should have been some kind of notification as to when your appearance in District ### court of appeal for small claims cases--is to take place.  If they did not offer you a date, you may wish to ask whether you can request a date in the near future, and when you do, you would need to serve the opposing party at its mailing address as listed on the complaint in the small claims case.I am not quite sure why the Clerk's folks did not explain this to you (as it is not legal advice, but just nuts-and-bolts logistics), but if I were in your situation, I would request an appeal date before the District Court judge.Best wishes to you this new year.43874.0131944444 I have a claim dated ###( pending)43873.8645833333 I have a court date in March in Wake County.Friends of mine were drinking in a car in a quiet neighborhood quietly.

I drafted these myself based on what the statute requires and using similar types of forms for other types of actions.  There are no sample forms that I could find that are specific to ### a judgment but I believe the sample forms I drafted cover all the statutory requirements. I wanted to give you WORD files that you could edit yourself but the system only allows me to send ### JPEGs and the like -- not Word files. Hopefully you can convert these into Word files or recreate them yourself without a lot of difficulty.Finally the attached PDF document lists some WEBSITES that I think are helpful for understanding how the process works in North Carolina.A couple things to note:###.  The sooner you file your judgment with the ### County Superior Court the better since priority for satisfying a judgment is determined on a first-come first served basis (in case others have judgments against these same people).###.  I read that a judgment lien in North Carolina will remain attached to the debtor's property (even if the property changes hands) for TEN YEARS.  So there appears to be a limit on the amount of time you can collect on that judgment. I hope this is helpful and easy to follow.Let me know if you have any questions.RegardsLinda"43878.9430555556 Dear Ms. ###,I will look into this question for you and get back to you soon with some information.Regards,Linda43877.7090277778 I have a money judgement from small claims court in ### County, WI. I want to place a lien on their rental home i Concord, NC.The couple moved to Kannapolis, NC, and took out a land contract on that home that they currently live in. They also bought a single family home in Concord, NC (### County) that they rent, they do not live in it. I would like to place a judgement lien on the rental home in Concord, so if they sell it, they would have to pay me. I also know this would effect their credit rating so they could not buy more houses. (these people are slum ### and rented me a house that was uninhabitable)Do I need to file the money judgement from ### County Courts, WI in ### County, NC first, to place the lien, or do I just file the lien papers with the Clerk of Superior Courts in ### County? Please explain if you could.Can you tell me or direct me to a web site, that shows what needs to be on the lien paperwork, so I do this correctly?I don't have a ton of money so I am trying to do this myself.I appreciate any help you can give me. Thank you!43874.8875 Thank you very much! This was very very helpful!###43884.8673611111 You are very welcome, ###!Best of Luck!Linda43884.89375 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  While I would normally say that your rights for recoupment of labor/materials-related costs would have been forfeited due to failure to file a notice of lien under North ### statutory mechanics and materials lien provisions (i.e., N.C.G.S. Chapter ###), I believe that you can safely pursue a claim here based on a simple legal theory of breach of contract.  My thinking on this stems from the fact that there was a negotiation for a lower amount to be paid, with installments that continued for some time before default occurred.  This makes this situation a little different (and legally distinct) from the normal case where a laborer furnishes labor and materials at the site of an owner's home and real property.I do not believe a final demand letter for payment will prove effective in procuring compliance, given what your communications have been as of late.  However, a lawyer can send one for good measure--and as evidence that you tried everything in your power to resolve this fairly and amicably.  In order not to run afoul of any fair debt collection acts under federal and state law, the letter would need to warn that the next step is to pursue a small claims lawsuit.If you choose the demand letter route, I would just demand the entire outstanding balance rather than an installment plan--mainly because that approach has already proven ineffectual.Either at the local courthouse or at ###, you can obtain a Complaint for Money Owed" form as well an "Alias et ### Summons."  You would fill out the small claims complaint form and the summons as directed by those documents then make your filings with the Clerk of Superior Court and the Sheriff (you will need at least three (###) copies of both documents).  It costs $96.### and then $###0.###.  If both spouses hired you to do the work jointly you should list them both.  You can request a hearing as early as ten (10) to twelve (1###) days out but in order to ensure that the Sheriff has sufficient latitude to timely serve the defendants with legal process I suggest that you request a date at least fourteen (14) days out from filing.  Service can usually be perfected within two (###) to three (###) days of filing.The hearing will likely take around forty-five (45) minutes give or take depending on whether everyone shows up on time and whether the magistrate has many follow-up questions.  Be prepared with all documentation you have of the transaction history with the owners of the property and just in case it becomes necessary be prepared to ask a series of pre-considered questions of the defendant(s) in front of the magistrate under oath that can supplement whatever invoices printed texts/emails and other evidence you can produce to the magistrate's satisfaction.If you get a judgment against the defendant(s) they will have up to ten (10) days to appeal the ruling to District Court which is where the matter will all but certainly end one way or the other.  If the defendant(s) lose/s or if there is no appeal at all you can then proceed to executing your judgment through the Sheriff after the same serves a copy of the judgment and a "Notice to Claim Exempt Property which will protect some, though not all, of their personal property against the judgment.  Once the notice has been served and returned (or the defendant(s) has/have had the chance to file one), the Sheriff can then seize non-exempt property in order to pay the judgment.Best wishes to you in this matter.  I hope all goes well as you seek to recoup your justly owed sums.43875.1881944444 I did a landscape job for a customer in November of 2016.  The agreement was material which was about $### + labor which was going to be $###.  I finished the job in about 10-### ###.

I have found that every county in NC is different with their resources and ability to provide all the information you need.  Some are amazing and others just don't have the resources to walk you through the process.  Also, sometimes one county will do things a little differently from another, even though these procedures are spelled out by statute--meaning, everyone should be doing it exactly the same way.  But that's not always the reality.  Doing any sort of legal paperwork can be maddening and frustrating.I will take a look at this over the weekend and get back to you as soon as possible. I may have additional questions, so stay tuned.Regards,Linda43875.9590277778 Dear Ms. Mote,In order to answer your question, I need additional information.###.  What is the purpose of your name change? (marriage, divorce, other)  The procedures are different depending on the reason.###.  Can you attach the other forms you have completed, so far?  Or at least provide a complete list the names of the forms you have gathered (the name of the form should appear at the top of the form)?For example:PETITION FOR NAME CHANGE (ADULT)NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE NAME CHANGEAFFIDAVIT OF CHARACTERETC.###.   Finally -- can you tell me where you got the information about how to file for a name change? (Internet site, etc.)  I can look to see if you missed something in the instructions, or if the source of information you used was incomplete.Hopefully, we can get this sorted out for you.I look forward to hearing from you.Thanks,Linda43875.8423611111 Hello, ###,I have done some research on the name change procedures in North Carolina and have some followup questions to help determine what might be holding up your application. I am also attaching the applicable statute, which you might find helpful â€“ particularly, Â§###0###-5, which lays out the specific requirements for a name change application.###. More specifics about how and what you were told by the court?How did you receive the rejection from the court that your application was somehow incomplete? Was there a hearing with the clerk of court? Who did you speak to, and who gave you the information about the draft Order not being correct? Did you receive anything in writing? If so, can you share that with me?The reason I ask is because if the court undergoes a formal review of your application, it must either grant or deny the application, and if it denies the application, it â€œshall state the reasons for the denial.â€ See Â§###0###-5(f). If there was a formal denial of your application, you should have received that in writing, giving the reasons for the denial. But I donâ€™t know if the court actually reviewed your application in a formal way, or if some staff person at the court looked at your application package and told you something was missing (and therefore gave it back to you to complete and did not give it to the clerk of court to make a decision). If you can provide more details about that, maybe we can get to the bottom of this.###. The forms you have collected look correct, but what about a Criminal Background Reports?From what I have researched, the forms you are submitting are correct, including the draft Order for Adult Name Change (which also can be called an â€œOrder and Certificate of Name Changeâ€--but it's the same form). However, it's not clear from your response whether you included the criminal background reports, or if you just had your fingerprints taken.  Under the statute, the clerk of court is supposed to inform you of the requirement to order these reports yourself and to give you the information on how to do that.  See Â§###05(a)(###) and Â§###05(b) of the attached statute.If you have not yet ordered your background checks, here is an excellent website that spells out all the steps for applying for a name change in North Carolina â€“ which includes a step-by-step process for ordering your state and federal criminal background reports (including the necessary forms): https://eforms.com/name-change/nc/#AdultNameChange (see Steps ### ###).If you have already ordered your criminal background reports and included those reports with your name change application, then we are back at my Question ###. We need to find out specifically what it is the court says is missing from your application â€“ because aside from the criminal background reports, you appear to have provided all the correct forms.Let me know what more you can tell me and if you have any questions about the information I have given you.Regards,Linda43877.9791666667 Hello, ###,I'm just touching base with you because if this matter remains inactive for too long, the ABA administrators will close it out with only ###, and then we have no way to communicate with each other.If you have any news, let me know.Otherwise, I'll wait to hear from you.  Mainly, I just wanted to keep this matter active so it doesn't get closed out.Linda43904.7777777778 Hello, ###.Still no response from the clerk's office.  I have not yet called back since leaving a message on Tuesday, as I explained above.I would like to have the details concerning the dates you submitted your application or supplemented it, and the dates when you contacted the office to follow up (and ### to the extent you know them of the people you have spoken to or who have contacted you about your application).  Please see my list above.  It would make it easier for me to make the point that this application has been sitting in limbo for too long if I know the details about the dates and your attempts to follow up.Thanks,Linda43889.625 Hi Linda!  The reason is other, I am currently undergoing transitioning and am changing my first name to fit how I present myself socially and professionally.

But I will indeed compile a list of when we started it to the times that we contacted them, I will try to have that to you by tonight.  Thank you for all the help, hoping there is not something else going on too.-###43889.6701388889 I am hoping not and I did not receive such a warning but I will keep that in mind!  Thank you so much for making sure this stays active and I will keep you updated on what happens.  And I am hoping the same, I know NC is in a state of emergency but I am hoping the same.### 43904.7875 I have actually done both background checks, SBI and FBI along with the fingerprints.  Everything included in the checklist has been submitted but when I tried to check on the status the clerk told me that a typed Order for Name change was needed saying the document I included which was called the order and that showed up on Forsythe Court website was a certificate.  The ### country Court has not been very helpful and when I tried to ask for an example they directed me to Forsythe website.  Which just showed me all the documents I submitted.43878.3131944444 I have been working to file a Legal adult name change and have submitted all the forms, yet the court keeps claiming that I've not submitted an Order the name change, I thought it was the correct document and even verified that it was but they are trying to say that the Order is a certificate and now I am unsure what exactly they mean by an Order for Legal Name change and they have not been much help in trying to figure it out or help me find it.  I was wondering if I could get pointed in the right direction? I have attached what I thought was the correct file but they are saying that it is not it.43875.7902777778 I have not, unfortunately.  I left a voicemail on Friday morning reminding her that I had left several messages, already.  I also asked that if she got my voicemail to please leave a date and time when she would be available to speak to me.  No response.I think the next step would be for you to go back in person with a complete copy of your file and ask specifically what is missing and when they plan to make a decision on your petition. I think you should also have a copy of your receipt showing they accepted payment to demonstrate your file was complete.  Also -- the timeline of your actions to get them to act on your petition.If they continue to say there's something wrong with your draft Order, you should have a copy of the draft Order from the ### County website to show that yours is exactly the same and make them point out specifically what they think is missing.  I would also suggest printing off everything from the ### County website that gives instructions and sample forms for an Adult Name Change in case they say something else is not right.I started typing up some specific questions for you to ask so you have some type of a road map to follow if they continue to give you vague or ### responses.  If you can wait for that, I think it will be helpful for you to know how to respond.  I also would strongly suggest that you write down all the answers you get and who gave them to you so you have a record.Another option -- but it's premature right now -- is to file a public records request (NC version of FOIA) to get copies of adult name change petitions and orders that have been granted by this court so you can see (or show) that your petition and order are the same.  Of course, there is no deadline to act on a public records request, either, so I could see them sitting on that, too.  But it's a step to show that you are trying your best to get them to do their job.I really hope that this is just a lack of initiative on their part and nothing more.  A couple days ago I got a query from someone in a similar situation in another county who wants to make a simple name change to her 3-year old's last name because she (the mother) was never married to the father, the father is not listed on the birth certificate and the father has basically abandoned the child.  The clerk's office was also very ### and suggested she could not file the papers without an attorney--even though she already had all the forms she needed.  Totally not true, of course.  A different situation from yours, so maybe this is just bureaucratic ### at play.  Anyway, I will finish that list of questions for you and send them.At some point, if you/we really cannot get them to move on this, a more aggressive approach might be necessary using a local attorney.Linda43899.8527777778 I hope so, too.  I am not familiar with how that office works.  A clerk of court is like a judge and may be in court all day handling cases.  I don't know if that's true for an assistant clerk of court.  It could be that she's not at her desk very much to handle phone calls.  The next time I call, I will try to speak to a receptionist to ask what the assistant clerk's schedule is like, and whether it is difficult for her to return calls.  No one offered that information the two times I called and left a message with a live person, but it's worth asking.Thanks for pulling together the information.  Linda43889.6805555556 I managed to get my name change to go through!  I wanted to message you to let you know and to thank you for all the help that you've given me!-Officially ###43934.1145833333 I posted the answers in bold to keep with the ###:-###rd:  Posted Petition (after coming in before and being told that I would have to find everything on ### county's website).  It was the intent to file, the one you have to post on the community board and leave up for ###.   Put it up at this time. -###th: took down the petition, tried to file, said order was missing. When I went to the front desk there was a lady named Ms. ###, she was unsure if I had everything I needed so she went to the back to get another woman, unfortunately her name escapes me but she had dirty blonde hair, ### likely late forties.  This woman looked through the files we had and said we needed to get the order. She told us to check the ###e website and that was that for the day.  -###th (a delay due to everyone having the flu: We came in and filed everything, including the order which we even verified while we were there, and even have the receipt where we paid the fee.) Were told it should take a week tops but that they would try and call us in a few days.  Going back to the court we were again greeted by the desk clerk (everyone at the desks were nice and did their best to help) but again they fetched the same woman from the back and she told us that we had everything, she placed it in a folder and we paid.  She stated we would hear from them within a couple of days to a week.-###rd: Went in to check since we did not receive a call, just to check, were told it would take a bit more time.  The woman at the desk greeted me and went to go check before coming back to tell me that she was informed it would take a bit longer and that we would receive a call, there was no mention of the order. -###th: Tried again, the lady at the desk said that she would leave a message to have the clerk call me back.  This time I called as I had been busy most of the day and could not find the time to physically go in. -###th: The day I put a message on this board, I called again and was told I was missing the order and that I had never submitted it, even though I had and confirmed the paper was correct.  When I called I called the civil line and had them patch me through to the clerk because they were unable to help me, but then the clerk of the court told me that I had not submitted the order which had to be typed up.  But when I pointed out I had submitted the order and that it was confirmed she stated that it was not the order but instead the certificate. Also -- when I refer to you to someone else about your petition, which pronoun do you prefer?  The ### I prefer are he/ him though they/ them is also fine as well.   I appreciate you working with me on this and sorry it took so long to get back, VA decided to throw a bunch of appointments at me.  Let me know if there is anymore information you need.Thank you so much for all the help,###43893.9458333333 I spoke to the people in the civil department (at the courthouse itself it seems to all be in one room) I spoke to the woman at the civil affairs desk and the clerk herself.  When I went in person they told me that it would just take a little more time for them to get it finished, which I was not very surprised about because, as a Veteran, I know how long paperwork can take to process.However, when I called over the phone last week they suddenly told me that I was missing the Order for Adult name change, even after I submitted the attached document and verified that this was the correct one.  When I mentioned this, they stated this document was not the order but the certificate.  Even if Forsythe's website has only this when looking for an Order.Also thank you so much for all your help.I'm changing my name to ###, ### is my legal name.43878.7083333333 I spoke with the clerk and brought in the order, she said this was the correct one.  And I made sure she put in the folder.  She said she will try and contact me by the end of this week or at the latest next week (due to coronavirus lockdowns).  From what her, the counter folks say is they recall this being brought in but she admitted she may have misplaced it.  She also seemed much more friendly than last time.  So hopefully I hear from her soon.-###43910.9284722222 I think I have a basic idea of the timeline.  It might be a little ### because my memory isn't so great sometimes but I think I have it down:-###rd:  Posted Petition (after coming in before and being told that I would have to find everything on ### county's website).-###th:  took down the petition, tried to file, said order was missing.-###th (a delay due to everyone having the flu:  We came in and filed everything, including the order which we even verified while we were there, and even have the receipt where we paid the fee.)

I think that is what there is so far, if there is anything else please let me know.  Thank you again and I do hope it isn't anything else that is holding this up, just people not knowing things well enough.  But I appreciate all your help.-###43891.05625 I understand.  Hopefully, with some ### and persistent ###, they will move this along.Attached are the list of questions I suggest.  If you can think of anything else, please add it.   The objective is -- anytime you get an answer that is not satisfactory, follow up with more questions and press them for detail.I also included the Timeline at the end for quick reference.And as I said, please write down as much detail as you can about the responses you get and from whom.If you go in, and Ms. ### says she is not available, insist that they make an appointment when she can meet with you.  I gave you a list in the attached document of documents you should take.  One of them is the statute -- in case they say something that is not consistent with what the statute requires, or in case you want to ask them to point to the exact provision that supports whatever they are claiming.Let me know if you have any questions.Linda43899.9625 I wanted to check in, still no call but I called today and left a message.  They are working in shifts so I am going to try calling again on Monday when ### ### is working. 43924.8305555556 I was just checking in to see if you have heard anything yet?43899.8305555556 I would prefer ###, I just used ### cause of the whole complication of legal vs. preferred.   But thank you, I know I was personally confused as well.  Both I and my parents have dug into it as well and we're all very lost. But again, thank you so much, this has been a wild ride.  43878.7256944444 I'm happy to help, ###.Ms. ### has not yet returned my messages from last week.  I called again today and got her voicemail.  Instead of leaving a message, I called back to speak to someone in person, and the receptionist told me that Ms. ### was in the office today but was away for lunch.  It was shortly after ###:### (I specifically waited until ###:###. . . .).  I told the receptionist that I had left two voicemails last week and that she had not yet returned my call.  Without my asking, the receptionist offered to give Ms. ### a written message asking to call me.  It's after 5:###, their office is closed, and she has not returned my call. I will give her until the end of the day tomorrow (Wednesday).  If I don't hear back, I will call on Thursday morning and leave a voicemail if she doesn't answer.  I also will call the receptionist to ask if Ms. ### has an e-mail address I can use.  (They are not posted online)  Another option would be to send a letter by regular mail requesting a date and time for a phone call.  I think it is too soon to jump to conclusions, but I wonder if there is a reason she is not being responsive.  Hopefully, not.  But we will cross that bridge when we get there.  The problem with the statute is that it does not require the clerk of court to respond to an application within a certain time.  Presumably, she could sit on this as long as she wants until it gets to the point where it's really unreasonable.  Which reminds me -- can you give me a timeline of your application process?  ###.  On what date did you first submit your application? ###.  What was the last date you submitted something to them (I think that was the draft Order)?  ###.  On what dates (as best you can remember) did you contact the court to inquire about the status of your application? Please give the way you contacted them each time (i.e., by phone, in person)Who you spoke to (if you don't know the name or their title, just give whatever information you can about the person)What they told youI think we need to start a record of your attempts to get them to act on your application.Thanks,Linda43886.9256944444 Just keeping the thread alive until I can get there weds, but the questions will help alot and hopefully they actually do something this time.43907.0305555556 No problem, ###!  I can imagine these bureaucratic ### are the last thing you need.It occurred to me that it might be more productive if I am able to identify to the ### County clerk's office that I am calling on your behalf.  If it's a small court that does not handle a lot of name change applications, it's likely someone will be familiar with your file.  Maybe that way I can get them to explain exactly what is missing.  But I need your permission first.  If you prefer I call without identifying you, I can do that, too.  Just let me know.I see you were born in ###.  Was one of your parents in the military, as well?  My family has personal connections to Heidelberg, and I've been there a few times, myself.  A very beautiful city.  What branch of the military did you serve in?Linda43878.7569444444 Oh, I was not aware of that!  But we're going to head to the courthouse on Weds my dad is going to be joining me to help as well.  We had to delay going because we had a family emergency.  Thank you for checking in!43904.7819444444 Oh, that sounds very hopeful.  I hope it doesn't get delayed any longer.Thanks for the update.Have a good weekend,Linda43910.9541666667 Ok, good.  I usually get an e-mail from the ABA giving me notice that it will be closed out in ###.  I don't know if you get the same type of notice.  Since it's the weekend, I was concerned that the notice might come today and I wouldn't see it until Monday after they closed it.I'm glad you have a family member to join you.I hope this coronavirus doesn't interfere.  So many things are being shut down, and I know that some of the courts are cancelling their dockets.  I just hope this isn't another thing that delays your petition.Good luck, and keep me posted.Linda43904.7840277778 Ok, thanks for the update.  Good Luck!Enjoy the weekend.  Good weather, at least.Linda43924.8979166667 Ok.  I agree that is very confusing and not at all helpful.When you tried to check on the status, did you do so by telephone, in person?  Do you know who you spoke with?  In which office?I will call the clerk of court's office at the ### County Superior Court to see if I can get some answers.  I won't mention you or your name specifically.  I may not be able to call until later today or tomorrow.  But I will do it as soon as possible.Stay tuned.Linda43878.6368055556 Okay thank you, I will go about doing so and get things together.  Along with printing off a list of what is needed from Forsythe county,  I really appreciate it and will get everything together, and I hope it is just ### or incompetence on their side.  A local attorney will be tough, as my funds are nearly non-existent.  43899.8861111111 Okay, thank you very much for all the assistance!43893.9861111111 So, I've not heard anything yet.  I'm not sure if things are delayed cause of covid but I'll keep you updated!###43918.4118055556 Thank you for doing all this for me, I really appreciate all your hard work.  Hopefully, her husband is okay and hopefully, we can figure all this out.  I hope your weekend is going well and thank you again.-###43884.8298611111 Thank you for sending that and also for clarifying the name change.  I had assumed ### was the new name.  Do you prefer that I call you ###?I will call them and try to nail this down.  Their response makes no sense because the document IS an Order.  I don't see how they can say it is not.  And as you said, you used the model they recommended to you.  I have searched and searched, and so far, I have found only two sites that provide a sample North Carolina Order for Name Change -- ### County and a website that provides sample forms for a number of jurisdictions across the country.  They are essentially the same, and as the ### County website states, there are no official" forms for North Carolina adult name changes.  I will let you know what I learn.  Linda"43878.71875 Thank you so much for all your help, Linda.  Yeah, it is a little frustrating, but I was confident I had done what was needed, but I really appreciate it.43875.9611111111 Thank you so much!  I appreciate all the help you are giving me and I also hope her husband is ok as well.  I truly appreciate how much you are doing for me and aiding me in this confusing situation.-###43880.7381944444 Thank you, ###.  That's helpful.Some follow-up questions (in ALL CAPS) about who you spoke to, who gave you information:-###rd:  Posted Petition (after coming in before and being told that I would have to find everything on ### county's website).  YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE ### PUBLIC NOTICE, RIGHT?-###th: took down the petition, tried to file, said order was missing. WHO TOLD YOU THE ORDER WAS MISSING?  DID THAT PERSON TELL YOU VERBALLY?-###th (a delay due to everyone having the flu: We came in and filed everything, including the order which we even verified while we were there, and even have the receipt where we paid the fee.)

WHO TOLD YOU THAT?If you don't know the person's name or title, just tell me as much as you remember (###, a receptionist or office assistant, the assistant clerk of court (### ###), the clerk of court (### ###, etc.).Also -- when I refer to you to someone else about your petition, which pronoun do you prefer?Thanks, again.Linda43891.6722222222 Thank you, ###.  This helps me understand the timeline better.  I will continue to try to get through, and if that doesn't work, we will think of a Plan B.Stay tuned,Linda43893.9847222222 Thanks.  It seems the ABA allows about a week of inactivity before they give notice that they will close the matter, but it's smart to have the last communication during the week so that the notice comes on a weekday/workday instead of over the weekend.Good luck!  I really hope you made some headway.Linda43907.5423611111 That is completely fine, you have my permission.  And yes, both parents were active duty actually and stationed in ###.  They were off work and I were in Heidelberg when I was born.  We lived there for a bit after, I would really love to go back.And I served in the Army, though I kind of wished I had gone Air force but it's okay, working towards getting into a graduate school to get my masters in Sociology currently.43878.7645833333 Good afternoon, Ms. Noguera:Thank you for your question.  There are a few points to consider here, which I will lay out in brief statements below.  Please see the following:First, the statute of limitations for personal injury claims is three years, so whatever lawsuit or non-litigation claim being asserted need to be within that timeframe.  If your injury occurred on ###, your limitations period ends on ###.Second, not every slip and fall incident in a store necessarily means that the store was negligent (although it could very well be, based on the facts).  It depends on whether the store failed to take reasonable care, not extraordinary care to prevent harm to its customers.  What reasonable care" in this context means is that the store kept a regular round-the-clock check on inspections of produce areas restrooms and other places in the store where it is reasonably likely that someone will trip and fall if the surface is slick and unattended to the store might be able to avoid liability entirely or at the very least not be liable for a large monetary sum.  If the store can show that it kept its staff on a ### periodic check of the area where you fell--usually once ever ### although that is not a ### rule that satisfies the "reasonable care" standard necessary for the store to avoid being liable for your injuries.Third assuming that the store did its periodic inspections every ### its offer of $###.  Certainly they will lowball you at first since you do not have a lawyer but if you can counter-propose for something closer to the $###000487### that will likely be a fair settlement as long as you do not have permanent injuries from this incident that will cost you more in doctor's visits and physical therapy.  Fourth even if you cannot find a personal injury lawyer to handle your claim and negotiation with the store at least have a consultation for ### ### (even if you have to pay a modest consultation fee for it) to get a personal injury lawyer's more precise valuation of your potential claim.  Should you elect to do this bring with you any documentation you have of EMS doctor's visits and physical therapy sessions to the extent any of these apply.  The information you gain from this conversation would be worth the fee and would arm you better in your negotiating tactics with the store's insurance claims adjuster thereby maximizing your final settlement amount.Fifth personal injury lawyers might not be taking your case so far (for the long ### that is rather than an initial consultation) due to what they might perceive as the relatively low value of the claim.  This is not to belittle or minimize what happened to you or the pain you might presently feel but I write this only to inform you that in order to meet overhead costs some personal injury law firms have a minimum threshold of what they believe they can recover before taking on a case.  It is not greed or selfishness but just a business decision to ensure that they can survive given that besides consultations their work is almost entirely on contingent bases; this means they might go weeks without a paycheck.  Even working 5060 ### ### law firms that hope to stay afloat amid ruthless economic competition from other firms must be selective in what they take on and liberal as to what they decline.Sixth and final personal injury lawsuits are not brought in small claims court; the lowest level at which you would take this to court is District Court where the amount in controversy is between $###0004870### $25000.  However I would never attempt a District Court lawsuit without legal counsel.  Unlike small claims court which is designed for people to represent themselves if needed District Court and Superior Court ### procedural rules that truly require legal education and litigation experience.I hope these points are informative and helpful even if not everything I said may be to your liking (which I can understand given the circumstances).  Hopefully you can soon seal down a settlement for at least moderately more than what the first offer has been.  As a last precaution any settlement agreement that might be forwarded to you should be reviewed between you and a lawyer before you sign it.  Many lawyers will review a document like this for consultation fees ranging from $### $### $300.  Remember that once you sign the settlement it is binding regardless of whether you fully understood it in a legal sense.Blessings and best wishes to you and your family in ###."43878.7833333333 I walked in to the new Wegmans ### ### and was browsing produce in the front of the store when I slipped and fell on the slick concrete floor where a small piece of fruit had been smashed and produced a ### of juice/fluid.  I was in a great deal of pain when I fell and was advised to stay still until EMS arrived in case of a fracture or other injury that might be worsened by moving.  A family member was with me and captured pictures (attached) and video of the slick floor at the time of my fall.  I was taken to ### ###, had an xray done, and did not have a fracture but sustained damage to ### in my ankle.  I completed home physical therapy exercises and took over the counter pain medicine.  My recovery has been slow and difficult.  I have frequent discomfort when walking and putting on shoes, I have difficulty with balance, and can't wear certain types of shoes without pain to this day.  I've contacted numerous personal injury law firms and none have picked up my case.  I am now responsible for $###.  With the pain I have endured and the difficulty I continue to have, my sense is Wegmans should be held responsible.  If the floor had been clean and maintained, I might not have slipped and I wouldn't have needed to go through all of this.  I have been in contact with Wegmans claims department in Rochester, NY and the lawyer there, ### ###, wanted me to sign something releasing Wegmans of all responsibility for $###.  According to ###, she states we have no liability insurance to cover this".  As no law office in the area will take my case my only recourse at this time is to file a case in small claims court.  Is this the wisest and best action?  Should I settle with Wegmans for $750?  I received a letter from O'Malley Tunstall turning down my case stating "there is a specific amount of time in which you must file suit or you are forever barred from doing so; therefore if you wish to pursue your claim please do so immediately".  Am I beyond that specific amount of time?  I've even contacted legal aid of ### to no avail (they do not handle personal injury law).  Do you know of any lawyer that might help or provide guidance with my case and situation?  Is small claims court the appropriate next action? "43878.6388888889 Back in ###. Paid them up front before each surgery. The first surgery was done at the office but last ###. The next two surgeries had to be done at hospital. I have emails that The ### Institution was responsible for paying the hospital in full. This has not been done and last February it was turned over to the Medicredit and they garnished my State Refund. Iâ€™ve also have sent a check $5,### $###.  Total refund request from ### Institution $###. Could you please give advise or direct me to attorney that could help? I would want additional refund to cover the attorney fees43880.1347222222 Hello, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I would call or see a debt collection or consumer lawyer about this.  You can search on ### using the Find a Lawyer" feature or ask for referrals from the ### County Bar.  See the link below:https://www.meckbar.org/index.cfm?pg=LRS-home#Hopefully this will connect you with someone precisely fit to represent you if needed.  Keep in mind however that one practical obstacle that might seriously jeopardize your case is the statute of limitations issue; under N.C.G.S. ### you must pursue a claim at law for unpaid debts or breaches of contract within three (###) years so depending on when the breach occurred it may be too late to pursue this.  I understand ### but the key legal question from the outset is "When did the actual breach occur?"  I can guarantee you that if you decide to sue for a refund (or demand it privately short of a lawsuit) the argument on the other side will be that regardless of whether there was a breach that genuinely entitles you to a refund the time for pursuing this passed sometime in ###.If you can get over that hurdle you might have a good small claims or District Court case to pursue against the practice perhaps even with the prospect of being reimbursed for reasonable attorney's fees.Blessings and best wishes to you in ###."43880.2368055556 Thank you so much for your quick response and advise. This is more than what Iâ€™ve gotten from anyone.Thank you###43880.5166666667 You are very welcome.  I wish you many good and wonderful things this year.43880.6416666667 Son was driving girlfriend car and was in an ### rear end accident. The girlfriend's car was insured and my son is fully insured as well. This week he received civil summons for damages to other party car when he taught girlfriend's insurance had taken care of the matter. What should he do in this case. Can his insurance pay for damages if he files claim? Not sure yet if girlfriends insurance denied claim or other party refused amount offered. If other party refused offer what should he do now?43880.7020833333 Good afternoon, Kedar:Thank you for your question.  The correct answer cannot really be boiled down to as simple a list of resources as you desire.  While there are certainly resources you can consult--such as ### on North Carolina Corporation Law (good mostly for C and S corporations incorporated in North Carolina), there is really no one-stop database or book that will incorporate what it takes a competent ### lawyer several years after law school to fully learn (to the extent any area of law can be fully learned).  Even if you were to read ### cover to cover (and this would be the best one-volume treatise on the subject), that still would exclude much of North Carolina law as it applies to sole proprietorships, limited liability companies, and general and limited partnerships.  You can look up the statutory chapters on these areas (N.C.G.S. Chapters 57D and ###, principally, in addition to Chapter ###) at ###, but the annotated print version of the statutes at your local public library (or at ### ### if you wanted to use its undergraduate library, which should be open to you as a North Carolina citizen and taxpayer), you will have access to footnotes to specific NC cases that have interpreted the statutes in a particular way that would not be readily apparent when looking at the most current statutory forms online.  Access to the most cutting-edge information about the intersection of case law and statutory law is available only to licensed attorneys who are paying for access to the best databases--such as LexisNexis, Westlaw, Bloomberg Law, and the like.In short, a non-lawyer wishing to educate him/herself about North Carolina business and corporation law can consult several good resources if s/he has access to a library well-stocked with legal materials, but the simplicity that you are looking for as described here will be so elusive as to be virtually impossible.  The only way to truly master these areas and understand all the ### in which they intersect--and bear upon ### situations involving real people and businesses, in which real money is at stake--is to practice law in these areas for several years.  I know few lawyers who have practiced for less than five (5) years who are truly competent to handle complex business problems.But this answer at least gives you a start, and no cost to you.  Whatever you undertake as an entrepreneur in ###, I hope that you succeed and ### in this new year.  Thank you for your interesting and worthwhile question. 43880.8604166667 I am starting a business under the NAICS code 541611 & ### code 8742.  I am conducting legal research, but am not legal savvy.  My goal is to structure the business in compliance with State & Federal laws. (Preferably, I would like a source simply designed that even a legal incompetent person can easily navigate.)My questions are:What books or databases provide current north carolina state business laws? What books or databases provide current Federal business laws? 43880.7666666667 I am on supervisee probation for a year for fleeing to ### in NC. I have been on it since October. I have had one ###. My question is, is there anyway to terminate probation early, or be transferred to unsupervised? I lost my license for a year also due to the charge, and getting back and forth is not easy or cheap. What steps do I need to take to ask the courts to terminate my probation early?43880.9833333333 Hi. I was in a car wreck not my fault but my car was totaled. His insurance co sent me a check for my car not enough to pay it off. So I used to money to get another car and I am still making pmts on the totaled car. Where my car is financed said that their lawyer had taken over this and it was out of their hands. I am not sure what to do? Can you give me some advise?Thank you,### ###43881.6819444444 The fact that your old car was totaled doesn't mean that you're not responsible for the debt on it.  Unless you can negotiate a new arrangement with the finance company for the old car, I think your options are either (###) keep paying on the totaled car until the debt is satisfied, or (###) stop  making payments and see what happens.  If you simply stop making payments, I suspect that it will hurt your credit and that the finance company for the old car may sue you.  If they sue, they could get a judgment against you and try to collect on the judgment by, among other things, selling your assets (such as your new car).I'd try to contact their lawyer" (ask for the lawyer's contact information) and if it is financially difficult for you to keep making the old car payments ask if you can compromise the payments in some way (reduce the monthly amount reduce the amount owed).  Suggest that if they don't compromise you'll have no choice but to default and that they will be unlikely to collect on a judgment against you.  Their collateral for the original loan (the totaled car) is of course worthless now.  So without the ability to repossess the vehicle they might be willing to give you a break in order to keep some payments flowing and avoid spending money on legal proceedings."43922.6826388889 Good afternoon, Ms. Rhoades:Assuming the two disbursements (the ### ###) were actually loans, you can of course sue for repayment in small claims if the sums are not otherwise repaid.  This assumes of course that it was expressly understood between creditors and debtors that this was truly a loan situation and not a gift situation.  You can sue in small claims by filing a Complaint for Money Owed (cost $96) and by serving an Alias and ### Summons (cost $###) in the county where the debtors live.  The statute of limitations in North Carolina for breach of contract (including verbal loan agreements) is three years.As for the vehicle, the person who is entitled to sell, gift or otherwise dispose of the vehicle (whether for parts or otherwise) is the person who is listed as the title owner per the records of the DMV.  If the vehicle is outright in your name, and no further debts attach to it, you are entitled to do with it as you please.Is this situation as straightforward as I am assuming, or is there something important I may have missed here?  If the latter, please let me know and I will be happy to provide a follow-up observation.  I will leave this question open for a couple days just in case I need to address additional points.Stay safe, dry, well fed and warm amid the snowy weather in our state today and tomorrow.43881.8958333333 In ###19, I loaned a friend $###,###. In ###20, I paid off a $###,###-signer for because vehicle was set for repo. It was her ###.I discovered that the friend and her husband withheld funds that were to pay back total amount loaned. They have since terminated the ### and have no contact. They just purchased a home and have intent to sell their mobile home that is paid off. We have the title of the vehicle and planned on selling it until we discovered that the transmission is shot. What options do I have?Thank you for your time!43881.775 Ms. Rhoades:Thanks for your follow up; your supplementation here does provide the context for me that is helpful.  In essence, my answer does not change: you will need to sue in small claims court within three (###) years, if the debtors will not otherwise accede to requests/demands for payment in full.  In North Carolina, a small claims lawsuit can be brought only in the county where the defendant resides, or otherwise it will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  So if the debtors live outside Catawba County, be sure to file and serve in the appropriate county.Note that verbal loan agreements are legal and enforceable in North Carolina; the only loan agreements that North Carolina law requires to be in writing are commercial loans in excess of $50,000 (N.C.G.S. Chapter 22).  So if you have texts, emails and/or other documentary evidence of the debt and the underlying agreement, you can use these in small claims court, and show the magistrate what you have to establish your case.  If the magistrate agrees and the debtors cannot assert a credible defense (and so far, based on your postings here, it does not appear they can do so), a judgment will most certainly be entered, after which the debtors have ten (10) days to appeal.  If they do not appeal, or if they lose on appeal, your rights become fixed and you can serve the judgment through the Sheriff with a Notice to Claim Exempt Property which must be completed within ###.  Most essential household items and at least $###,###.Yes, you are correct that North Carolina law does not authorize a private individual to garnish wages, even with a judgment.  The Sheriff, however, can levy the judgement against saleable assets and bank accounts once the deadline for claiming exemptions has passed.Thanks for your well wishes.  Best wishes to you again.43881.9354166667 Thank you for your reply!Yes, you are correct in assuming that there are obviously more details to this situation but they are all as said but simple context. I did not want to provide an abundance of details and get lost in them but I can certainly clarify it fully. I loaned my friend (Via Check) ### to pay of her credit card loans to open her available credit to pursue buying a home. No official contract was done and the terms of repayment were by means of ###'s VA benefits. All of this was discussed via text messages as well as in person/phone call. In January, it was discovered that her ###-signed on. Only way to proceed with them buying the house they found was to pay it off. It was stated to all ###. Both my friend and her son signed the title and handed it over to us. (Discovered today that it is apparently an open title and it is illegal).Agreement for the car was we fix the car (costs added to amount owed) and resell it. The difference between what the car has sold for verses and amount paid out of pocket is what he was responsible for. After the son stopped payments, my friend agreed to take on the debt. The son made ### $### ###. The friend and her husband went back our original agreement of us receiving their tax returns as payment and they used the funds towards their down payment on the home they purchased last week. After confronting them (via text) about them breaking the repayment deal, they advised that they did not have the funds to pay us back. They made a claim that when they sell their mobile home (its paid off), they will then pay us. The person whom is buying said mobile home is a friend of their and buying it cash.I believe that North Carolina is a non garnishment state other than when it comes to the sale of property but I am worried that even if I am granted a judgement and a lein is placed on that property, they can find loop holes and all the court proceedings was for nothing.I have countless text messages from the friend, her husband and the son about all of this as well as both checks for both loans. I apologize If I went from zero context to an over abundance of details. Hopefully that makes the situation more clear cut. You as well stay safe and hope for an extended weekend as Catawba County tries to figure out what season we are in. LolThank you again! ### Rhoades43881.9194444444 Thank you so much for clarification on this matter. This platform is awesome and your help I greatly appreciated. Take care! 43881.9597222222 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question, and I hope you have fared well in the recent snowfall in ###.  I am very familiar with this situation (frustrating, I know), as a lawyer for a plaintiff in small claims court.  It is highly likely that the continuance will be granted; these are usually granted at least one time as a matter of course, with second or third continuances being progressively harder to get without good cause shown by the party or the party's lawyer (the latter if the party is represented).  You can object, but it will likely not go anywhere if the magistrate has already decided to grant the continuance.  I would call or visit the Clerk's office to see what the status is about the case, and whether the continuance has been granted.  If so, I would just let it go and move on, as the decision will likely stand in any event, and you do not want to antagonize the magistrate who will eventually end up hearing your case.  If the continuance has not been granted, you can share with the Clerk's staff why you believe the case should not be continued, and if necessary, the Clerk's assistants will put you through to the magistrate directly.Either way, I hope your case is eventually heard very soon, and that fairness and justice will prevail in the final outcome.  Have a blessed winter weekend.43883.1555555556 I am the plaintiff in a small claims suit in Wake County. The court date is Tuesday, ###th. I was just notified by the defendant's attorney that she has filed a continuance today (Friday, ###st). The defendant was served on ###th. Can I object due to the extremely short notice? If so, how? How will I find out if the case has been continued?  Thank you!Ã—43882.9180555556 Thank you again. You've been very helpful to me, and I'm very grateful for your generosity. 43883.70625 Thank you so much for your answer. I am on disability because I suffer from major depression and a panic disorder. This continuance, which I think is just a tactic on the part of the defendant to try to wear me down, would likely exacerbate my condition, and my psychiatrist would submit a statement to that effect if there is a likelihood it would make a difference. Do you think it's worth a try?Thank you again for your kind assistance.Ã—43883.2666666667 You are welcome.  Probably not.  Yes, it is most likely a delay tactic, which is the kind of game that people play when they do not want to face the inevitable.  But again, continuances are often granted as a matter of course if requested for the first time, so I would let it go and prepare for whatever alternative date has been set.  The Clerk's staff can confirm the date, day and time of your next scheduled hearing date.  Best wishes.43883.6361111111 My moving work box truck  been towed without reasons by ### Towing LLC.

Since you posted this question from ### County, I assume that that was the county where you were cited, and also where the incident leading to the officer's alleged violations of your rights occurred.  The citation would be governed under the local traffic section of District Court, and any defenses to the citation that you or legal counsel would assert would be brought in the same forum.  Any civil lawsuits to be brought under the same set of facts should be brought in District or Superior Court in the same county, or in federal court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, if you have valid constitutional or civil rights claims that you otherwise do not wish to pursue in state court.  You should definitely consult with a local civil rights lawyer if you intend to bring a civil litigation claim against an officer or law enforcement agency.Be well.  Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.43887.8104166667 Good evening, ###:Thank you for your question.  Just to be clear, there is a difference between being sued and being served with a notice to execute against property; if what you got recently was a civil summons and complaint, that would be a new lawsuit entirely from the first proceedings in 2010, and if the debt or obligation being sued upon in ### (###) years old, you would have a valid defense of expiration of the statute of limitations, unless the obligation arose under a contract signed under notarized seal, in which case the statute of limitations would be ten (10) years instead of three (###) years.  If what you got is a notice of execution of judgment, you should have gotten a Notice to Claim Exempt Property" along with a copy of the judgment (presumably from ###).  I suspect however that this really is a full-blown lawsuit and not a collections matter.Either way it sounds like you will need to consult with a civil litigator very soon so that you can arrange for counsel to be in place to either move for a ###0-day extension (which is granted as a matter of course as long as the Motion for Extension of Time is sought and filed before the initial ###0-day window closes) or prepare an Answer Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim or any combination of one or more of the following forms of responses as may be appropriate based on the complaint and surrounding facts of the litigation.  If you do not respond by filing and serving the appropriate response (Answer Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim etc.) the plaintiff will get a default judgment against you in North Carolina which can then be "domesticated" for execution purposes in ###.If you are thinking of bankruptcy you need to do that now (through a lawyer) as the "Suggestion of Bankruptcy" that will then be filed will then stay the state court proceedings while the federal bankruptcy proceedings are still pending.  One strategy might be to secure the ###0-day extension first and then use the extra time to consult with a bankruptcy lawyer in order to see whether filing for bankruptcy in federal court in ### would be a wise step based on legal ### advice.You can have a local ### County lawyer prepare for you the Motion to Extend Time with the corresponding Certificate of Service that will need to be filed alongside the motion and an Order Extending Time.  One of the local lawyers in ### County could prepare all of this for you for a small fee.  You could then search online for bankruptcy lawyers in your part of ### and plan your next steps.Best wishes to you going forward.

I know that at some point that I may not be as competent as I am now. How can I make my granddaughter power of attorney of my finances and health?43888.7083333333 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thanks so much for posting on NC Free Legal Answers, and for this very concise, yet informative, fact summary.  Unfortunately, I see this problem come up a lot in situations where there are two or more co-owners of real property, and no written property owners' agreement ### them, by which to enforce obligations related to maintenance, property taxes, improvements, repairs, etc.  There is no affirmative obligation imposed on two co-owners to pay their ###/###, even though there is a clear moral responsibility to do so.  Despite it being unfair for you to continue paying your ### share, if the taxes are not paid in full, the county can foreclose upon the property to pay the taxes (with the balance going to you and the other owner after subtraction of costs).  The county makes no distinction between whether one owner has already paid ###/###; its bottom line is only that it gets paid in full for whatever the tax invoice indicates is due.Normally I would say that the owners should enter into a written agreement concerning duties related to the property, but I doubt that the owner is willing to do this if he is not paying his ###/###.The one ### ### to this (maybe) is that when the property is sold, you can have the real estate closing lawyer adjust what each party on the seller's side is paid, based on your getting a credit for your paying property taxes above and beyond your ###/###.  But both sellers would need to know this beforehand, and it would need to be ### if the lawyer were to incorporate such adjustments in the written contract of sale.If the property is sold due to foreclosure, you can make the same argument to the Clerk of Court in special proceedings, and perhaps if there are funds left over after a tax foreclosure, you can similarly persuade the Clerk to adjust the balance of proceeds in favor of past overpayments as credits.  In order to do this, you would need to have receipts confirming that you and only you paid such taxes, and that these payments were not shared for 20###7, ###.Not entirely the answer that a person in your position would like to read, but there is some positive aspect of this, even if a sale occurs either voluntarily or involuntarily.  I hope that the property can be sold to a buyer you both are comfortable with, and that you can realize a nice profit soon without having to pay more than your share of taxes going forward.  I appreciate this question, and wish you a blessed spring of ###.43889.1659722222 I co-own a piece of property in ### county.

This is a very good question.  A voluntary dismissal does not change the statute of limitations for the claim(s) asserted in the lawsuit.  Under Rule ###, the plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses suit gets the benefit of two options for refiling, and can opt for whichever period is longer: (###) the one-year standard refiling period, and/or (###) the applicable statute of limitations for the claim(s) to be refiled.  So for example: a civil plaintiff files a lawsuit based on breach of contract, alleging that the breach occurred on ###.  The lawsuit is filed in TERM000###88 of ###0###8, and is voluntarily dismissed in ### of ###0###8.  The plaintiff has two options for refiling: the one-year period under Rule 4###, until ######9, or the three-year statute of limitations period, concluding on ###.  Since the plaintiff has a statute of limitations period that is longer than the standard one-year allowed under Rule 4###, the law gives the plaintiff the flexibility to opt for the longer period, in order to afford the plaintiff every meaningful opportunity to pursue his/her rights in a court of law.Really good question!  This is not something a non-lawyer would find easy to figure out, so I am glad that you had the ### to ask it in a forum for lawyers like this one.  It even took me close to a year of practicing law before I knew this.Best wishes to you this spring, and in your litigation matter.43891.7722222222 Consent order for temporary child support filed.Opposing party fails to abide by the order for ###, failing to provide court ordered support for the minor child.

It sounds to me what you are saying is that you want to notify the court that the obligor under a child support order has failed to provide such support.  If that is what you are trying to do, complete and file the attached motion to show cause.  If you want to ask the court to modify the current child support order, complete and file the attached motion to modify.Best of luck.43893.9361111111 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I am sympathetic to your financial ### as a single mother.  However, if you want to get the best result from this traffic matter (especially given that fifteen (15) mph over will likely cause insurance increases should you not secure a lesser offense or dismissal), you probably will need a local traffic lawyer in the county where your citation was issued out of state.  Many of these lawyers, fortunately, handle speeding tickets in mass volume, which allows them to charge low fees and still be profitable.  Some will charge fees as low as around $###, so representation may not be nearly as expensive as you might think.  It would be more a matter of making sure you can handle whatever court costs come as a result of getting a ticket.

I have never had to domesticate a judgment in ### or Maryland so contact a litigator in whatever county the defendant-debtor now lives and see if that option is open to you in this situation.  Hopefully it is.Second you can proceed only against the defendant-debtor named in the judgment.  If the judgment is only against one spouse you cannot proceed against the other or the other's assets--or for that matter against jointly held marital property.  You can proceed only against the wife and the wife's individual property.### "Find a Lawyer" feature can help you ### search for civil ### in VA and MD to the extent needed.

I think you should consult with a law firm that handles wrongful death actions; this is much more complicated than simply filing" a suit.  Wrongful death is a complex and nuanced area of law and it requires legal expertise to handle properly (some cases even take well over a year before they conclude in a settlement or jury verdict).

If you did not suffer an injury due to malfunctioning airbags, you would have far less of a case in terms of monetary value (if a case exists in that instance at all).  The only way to know for certain is to consult in person with a local lawyer who handles personal injury or defective products cases.  Many of these types of lawyers will offer either free or low-cost initial consultations of up to one (###) hour.  If you hope to make out a possible personal injury claim, be sure to retain any records of emergency room visits or medical consultations relating to incidents in which the airbag malfunction was a part, as these will help your lawyer evaluate the monetary value of a potential claim.### Find a Lawyer" feature might be a useful resource for you to use to search for local legal talent in the appropriate areas.  Search under "Personal Injury" and "Dangerous and Defective Products and see what lawyer profiles pop up in your search results for your town or city.  (Note that you may have to go as far as ### in order to get more numerous results, although I am sure you can find good firms in the small towns in western North Carolina as well.)Also keep in mind the ### County firm of ### Law Firm, P.A..  If you contact them and speak to ### (the son), tell him that his old law school classmate, ### ###, highly recommended him and his father to you for your legal consultation.  See the law firm information at the link immediately below:https://www.###lawfirmwnc.com/attorneysI hope this helps, and I wish you the best in this legal inquiry, and this spring more generally.  God bless you and your family.43897.8256944444 Cannot answer your question without a copy of the entire lease agreement.  Please attach so I can review it.###44077.6347222222 Hi ###, thank you so much for taking the time to respond. I am attaching the lease from the mall. It will be very much appreciated it if you can assist me with this issue.This is a brand new business as of last August, I applied for multiple grants, but was not able to receive any government grants or not eligible for any relief programs. I would like to also know if I don't have the money to pay for the rent, would filing a bankruptcy be the best option?Sincerely,Su Zheng44077.9979166667 I leased a ### at a mall, however due to covid the mall was mandated by local township to be closed down. My business therefore was shut down for three months, specifically ###, May and ### with no revenue.  Now that the mall is back in operation, management is demanding all full rents paid ($4,000/month) during the months of pandemic regardless. I would like to know what rights and options do I have in terms of negotiating with the mall. Am I obligated to pay for those months that i couldn't use the space for business operation? What part of a standard lease would I look at to find out any terms apply to such unforseen situation on rent payment obligation? Thank you so much for taking the time to answer my question.SINCERELY SU ZHENG44077.1527777778 Thank you so much for taking the time on a busy Friday to respond. Yes, we do have business insurance but does not cover natural causes like Covid. I guess I will have to speak with the mall management and see what is the best option they can offer me.Again I really appreciate your help, thank you for being so kind as a volunteer attorney.Sincerely,Su Zheng44078.8333333333 There is nothing that covers if there is a shutdown due to outside government actions in the license.  You might be able to fight the three months in court but it is unlikely you will win. You might want to try to negotiate say a 75% discount on those three months ($### instead of ###), or worst case is spread the three months over the rest of your license period and also add the amount added to your monthly fee to the calculation for what you pay if you make over a certain amount of money each month.The issue is the shopping mall has all the power.  They can just tell you to leave if you take them to court just to not have to pay the money.  This is kind of like the stores in the building that have a lease instead of a license and still owe for the rent on their location for every month.If you want to try to fight it, you can try contacting the Department of Consumer Affairs and file a complaint, but again, if the owner finds out you did they can cancel your license.  Did you have any insurance on the business for loss of income due to natural causes, etc?  If so, that might be a way to go.Good luck,###44078.7173611111 Have you checked the Where's My Refund?" web page and what is the status of your tax return? Does it show the return was received?  When you talked to someone on the phone did they confirm that they show your return was received? Did you keep a copy of everything you mailed in?  Did you use a trackable method for the mailing to prove they received it (if there is no received status on Where's My Refund)?There isn't much to do at this end except maybe contact the Taxpayer Advocates and see if they can help.  Next time don't mail your taxes.  It is the ### and most unreliable method.  Did you at least complete the taxes with a computer program?###"44078.7208333333 Have you tried getting your IP PIN through the online system? That might be an option for you to get your PIN.  If you get it and your return still shows as not received you can efile and get your refund faster.Good luck,###44079.1166666667 Hi ###, I check the website daily and it does not show ups as even being received yet. I also have a copy of all the documents I sent in. When I speak to agents at the IRS they say they can see exactly what I can see on Whereâ€™s my refund and thatâ€™s nothing so far. I had to mail in only because I recently moved and was not able to receive an IP PIN which would allow for me to e-file. The taxes were completed with everything except an IP PIN by a CPA at H&R Block. 44078.7305555556 Hi, I filed my taxes by mail back in ###th, ###. Due to the pandemic I was informed that staffing at the IRS was not at full capacity causing the mail to be backed up. Iâ€™ve been calling every week sometimes ### a week to check on the progress. The first update I received was that I should allow ### ###st, ###, however this is the end of week ###. Iâ€™m getting frustrated because Iâ€™m left to put my faith in one more week, however if there is no update in the system by next week, what can I do because the pandemic was no ### fault, but the word has been given to me to allow ###. I have two children to take care of, I have bills and no employment due to the pandemic. I would like to know is there any legal standing here if I do not receive my taxes or have a ### update in their system in the time frame for which they have provided me? 44078.5979166667 I was a victim of identify fraud from back in 2015. In the event of the move, I cannot have the IP PIN delivered to me by mail and they cannot give me a new one over the phone. It sounds to me like there is not much to be done.44079.0458333333 What is an IP PIN?  I know that you need a PIN from IRS if you are a victim of identity fraud and registered with the IRS for it.  Any other PIN you just enter one that you choose during the e-filing process.  And, most likely not a CPA at H&R block.  They hire at minimum wage for people to fill out taxes and then they are reviewed by a higher up, sometimes CPA, sometimes not.If they have not been shown as received you should be able to go back to H&R block and efile from the return they have in their computers for you.###44078.7597222222 Hello,My question is will I be able to press charges and sue for emotional distress for an incident that happened back in 2015. Iâ€™m unsure because I donâ€™t have any physical evidence anymore and my witnesses will most likely not testify for me because they love the person much more. This person physically assaulted me after an argument he initiated on ###. All persons involved are my family members. I was body slammed, slapped, punched and stomped on which re triggered me not being able to speak correctly again which my siblings can attest for from me calling them and my mother. He triggered this because I had a minor concussion weeks prior to the incident. He is much bigger than me and has a black belt in martial ### so I couldnâ€™t fight back even if I tried. He only stopped when his brother got him off of me. This man is my uncle and he has bullied me and my siblings since we were children. I suffered emotionally after the incident, contemplated suicide because I knew no one would help me or hold him accountable for his actions since heâ€™s the family favorite and Iâ€™m just a child to them. I had nightmares from the incident and woke up for weeks with pain. I was too afraid to go to the police because if nothing happened to him I wouldnâ€™t be sure if heâ€™d come back and harm me again and this would cause my family to dislike me for attempting to do so. All I could do is cry and listen to family members say theyâ€™ve had worse done to them. I still get flashbacks anytime heâ€™s around and run to my room to stay away from him. Iâ€™m not the first women heâ€™s assaulted in the family but I live with his mom for the time being so I canâ€™t escape him. I tried to be cordial with him but he is ### to anger again and I fear ### come to harm me again but this time in front of my one year old child. He wants to kick me and my sister out of our grandmothers home. He has a vendetta to get us out of his momâ€™s house which we are trying to do because this living situation is unbearable as well. So heâ€™s coming from North Carolina to here to begin another altercation.  Iâ€™m trying to find a place to live but nothing is cheap around New ### but Iâ€™m still trying. Please I donâ€™t want to fear him anymore and his Iâ€™m untouchable attitude. Please give me any advice on how much I can sue for and how to build my case without any physical evidence and a few testimonies from after the incident happened. I want my justice and for him to never put his hands on another woman in this family at at all and think ### get away with it once again.

At that point I told him that no one is buying the item and the hood was really too expensive and I couldnâ€™t deal with it anymore and I just donâ€™t want him to lose money on the space. He sent me a message and told me to tell him when I want  to meet, I told him no rush just to let me know when he was next at the property. He called me the next day, told me that someone had rented the property the night before  and that he told them about the hood and they said no problem they could afford it and that he gave them my phone #. now he does not want to return my deposit.

I was living in ### county, n where I was living I was paying rent. There is a contract, I had my property, my license to the address. basically everything to proof I lived there and paid rent without being late. The owner was going problems due to unemployed, forcing the home to go into foreclosure. He and I came to an agreement that I would buy the home. So I was basically working it out with his bank, where I would borrow the loan from. Ok so now the ball is rolling and I'm getting whatever they need from me and so on. Well it came to a point where a sheriff left a notice about eviction, addressed only to the landlord. I was confused, I asked the owner about it, he said not to worry cause the foreclosure department is probably just not talking to the office down the hall. And insist that Im good because the eviction doesn't include me, cause my name wasn't on it. I really didn't feel comfortable with that answer, so i called the number on the eviction notice, which is the sheriff. i explained to him the situation, he advised me to go to the court with all important documents because its possible they don't know i was living there. i followed his instructions and gave the court my information. They told me that someone would call me. I asked politely to please let me know as soon as possible. The following day in the morning I called the court and asked about the status. I was told that judge denied it, I asked why. And she just said the judge didn't give a reason and they sometimes just don't. i called the sheriff and asked him what were my options, he stated i had none, only that he could take his time a little bit, but i have to leave. This is ### ###, I paid my rent already, the bank won't call me back. so i backed what i could in ###. I am a disabled vet. i grabbed what i could and left. Sorry i just needed to give a little background. my question is What can I do to correct this situation, because since then I've still been homeless, ill, and recently diagnosed with cancer, I mean overall it just created a unnecessary hardship. If you have anything you need to ask me or explain, please just let me know. In advance thank you for your time.Oh sorry one last thing, I learned just before leaving because someone left a long yellow envelope on the front door. the reason for the eviction/ denial from the judge is because the bank told the judge that i was a occupant not a tenant, so i guess the judge just agreed with the bank.44119.0138888889 How do I present the issue of wages owed by an LLC (sole ###, I believe).?

I was currently working at Pepboys when this happed. And I had spoken to the manager he said no one called to get it towed. He did give me the number to Pepboys legal department I contacted them the said they should have an answer by Monday-Tuesday. I had went there a few months after my car getting towed and they refused to tell me who towed my car all they did was ask for my keys and title so the could give me an estimate to fix the damages I had on the car. I was dumb enough to think they would give the keys back after giving me an estimate but they said they need to keep the keys I never gave them my title and my car has a lien on it I dint want to pay for it if I donâ€™t have my car in my possession then the tow company can do whatever they want with my car. I havenâ€™t even thought of consumer affairs but I will call them. Would you have a phone number I could call to contact them in ### county. What kind of attorney would I need because Iâ€™ve been contacting multiple and they donâ€™t handle situations like this or if you would happen to have a number to an attorney that could help me. 44149.5409722222 I had gotten into a car accident while I was pregnant with my daughter last year after getting off work.

When I came back to work my car was gone I found out ### towing came and picked up my Iâ€™m not sure who call but I never called and definitely didnâ€™t pay them to pick up my car I didnâ€™t even have money to fix it.

Car parked there for ###?  Did anyone from PepBoys call to have it towed?  What does Yuli the store manager say?  Did you ask the towing company for proof of the authorization to tow?  Did you ask the tow company for proof of their authorization to tow since they are not listed on the No Parking signs as the authorized towing company?  Did you call Consumer Affairs like the sign shows to file a complaint?  Since they are not the tow company listed they have broken that rule.There are Towing Laws and if this was done without permission by someone at PepBoys there is a good chance it falls under a Consumer Fraud Act violation.  But, first verify where they got permission from to tow and then follow the trail to that and verify that someone from PepBoys called them.   Talk to a local attorney.  If it is consumer fraud, the attorney could collect their fees from the tow company.###44149.0548611111 You can contact the ### County Lawyer Referral Service athttps://www.###bar.com/page/LawyerReferralServicePublicYou should explain to them that you believe yr car was illegally towed, the company is holding your car refusing to return it without paying outrageous fees.

I have a horse that requires a simple amount of extra care (adding water to feed as he is prone to choking which is very dangerous) and the ### owner has not complied even though I have explained several times why my horse needs this specific type of care and have gotten a vet's opinion. Other boarders have left due to similar reasons (dangerous fencing or shelters, horses not being fed adequately, etc.) I was going to give my month's notice that I was leaving today - which would really have ended up ### - and just so happened to catch my horse in the middle of a choking episode. A ### hand approached me (along with the owner) and said when he does this it usually clears up within ###'s owner was not made aware of the situation. I am deeply concerned with the quality of care my horse has been receiving especially after a vet recommended his feed gets soaked and he is no longer made to wear a cribbing collar (a device that goes under the ### jaw to keep him from chewing ###) while pastured outside. He is made to wear this because the owner claims he is destroying the fencing, but this simply isn't the case as the ### fencing was already falling apart before I moved my horses to this facility and metal paneling has already been put up as a new fence line. The ### owner has already made it clear she will not remove the cribbing collar and has come up with many excuses as to why she can't soak my ### feed.

I own a Subway franchise under my LLC, and I am the sole franchisee. For the last couple of years, my business has slowed down but we always broke even. No serious issues. When the pandemic first started, my business was hit, hard. My business/revenue dropped 60+% from the previous year. I applied to as many covid small business loans/grants that I could, including PPP and SBA and county grants. Most of those have either been used up or still pending. I have been paying a reduced monthly rent for my business since March because thats all I could send in, I barely make any profit at all to pay the full amount. My landlord/lease company won't reduce or waive my rent even though I dont get any business. They want me to pay $18,###'t have the money. And even if I paid, I still wont be able to afford the rent for the upcoming months. After expenses, employee compensation, royalty fees, utilities, etc.. I cannot pay the full rent, I am losing money. My lease ends in ###'t know if my business will last that long since business has not picked up at all since Covid-###. I never thought I would have to consider shutting down my business, I have had it for over ###. The lease/landowner will not accommodate the rent for me even during a pandemic. I cannot pay it, even if I have to take out loans, I dont know how I can even pay them off. I'm not sure If I should consider filing bankruptcy or what. If I close my store, I'll most likely get sued for breaking the lease agreement too early but I just don't think I can stretch myself thin any longer. What should I do? -RP44152.1104166667 Your franchise agreement is a contract that Subway is enforcing.  It is up to you what you want to do.

My daughters law guardian is appealing the dismissal with an emergent application to appeals court. In her application, just as many times in court and in documents filed throughout our litigation, this lawyer has lied to the appeals court, misrepresented facts of the case, and is misleading the appeals court through deceptive tactics. I am not trying to stop her right to an appeal. I am trying to stop her lying and misrepresenting facts. I am trying to expose her actions and behaviors that have violated code of conduct and continue to harm my entire family and her client, my daughter.Can I file for emergency i###unction on her application for appeal that requires her to stop lying and misrepresenting the case?

Other than under the Statue of Frauds, oral or verbal contracts are just as binding and enforceable as a written contract. Evidence proving that a contract, in fact, took formation can be the biggest problem surrounding oral or verbal contracts44159.05 As a tenant, are there laws to protect oneself if the landlord is causing defamation of character and business, not providing a safe work environment, and not providing a legally safe building, up to codes?  I have a lot of the story ready but am limited on the number of words so will generalize here:MY bf has been a tenant sharing the building with the landlord.   They have not renewed the lease in at least a decade.  Since then it's been a verbal lease in which my bf pays rent (on time) each month. For years, the building has rained inside, and it wasn't until just recently when it rained on the ### side did he repair it.  For years my bf's business and merchandise inside was damaged beyond repair and he's kept quiet in fear of the LL kicking him out...  You can't plug anything in with blowing a fuse, and if that happens, even if not at fault, the LL comes and attacks me. The landlord on several occasions, without notice, has made it so my bf's business has had to close.I come in and help with the office work, but the LL has verbally attacked me on many occasions, after a year of trying to ### me.  He has created a hostile environment.  He's not only verbally attacked me, but he also makes comments and stares at my female parts, without trying to hide it.  It's so uncomfortable that I can't use the restroom until he's left for the day.The LL allows smoking of not only cigarettes but marijuana causing both shops to ### of smoke.  After posting no-smoking signs and the LL getting a letter from the state, he's made it his mission to make things as uncomfortable as possible for me and my bf to work.He's continuously talking down to my bf and of his business, trying to persuade consumers not to work with my bf.  My bf has a wonderful reputation, and word of this has gotten back to us on numerous accounts.I have more to the story avail. if someone can guide me in the direction of learning the proper consumer landlord-tenant laws.  Thanks44158.6763888889 Commercial rental is based on the lease/contract and the rules are different than residential.  Lots of what you are explaining is contract enforcement.  Probably the best thing to do is find a new place and break the contract due to the landlords failure to provide what they are required to according to the contract.###44158.7708333333 Commercial tenant pays rent for use of the space.  If not happy with performance of contract your boyfriend needs to deal with it since his name on contract.  You are an employee of your boyfriend if you are getting paid to help.  The LL is your LL.  If you want to file criminal harassment charges you can contact the police and do that.  You need to talk to your boyfriend since it is his business.  Any legal help you might need would first start by talking to a local civil litigation attorney and paying a retainer fee if they say they can help in certain ways.  Again, you need to talk to the boyfriend.  The contract is between him and the landlord.  He needs to stick up for you if the LL is treating you badly.###44158.8506944444 I very much appreciate your time ###. I know, by what I've written it all seems trivial, but there are many, many more things that are going on, that I'm just not able to put into words at the moment, and wanted to examine the situation while I had a moment of time...  Thank you again.  I know your time is valuable.44159.0472222222 Thank you for your response.... we've been looking for a new place to no avail.  (Think that's the right way to put it)I am writing this from my point of view, there is much more to the story, and many sides to it, but this is my personal accounts in the following matter:My bf has been renting his repair shop for over 10yrs in its current loc.  The shop is a warehouse split into his shop & the ### business on other ###.  They're intertwined, the lease has not been updated in many yrs.  It's been on a cont. lease since the 1st signed.  I have no info on that, but I am writing bc since I've been here, ### been issues that I have taken into account that just do not seem proper, so I am here at your mercy for advice.   To start, when my bf first came here, the LL ### his worker, I know this has no legal ramifications, but it gives a little back story...When I started helping here at the shop, as the office manager, the LL on many occasions tried to recruit me to work for him.  He's a ### old sole that continuously stares at my female parts and makes it quite uncomfortable, to the point that I wait until he leaves to be able to use the restroom which happens to be on their side of the shop.  After realizing that I would not come work for him, he's made several personal attacks on me on many occasions.  The first that I will note is when there was a minor accident in the parking lot, requiring us to provide proof of business insurance.  I asked him for the documentation on what insurance we needed to be up to standards with ( I know that is not the correct wording, so please bear with me) He raised his voice and attacked me, violating me with his words and his actions.  He made a personal attack on me for simply asking what is needed" so that I can provide the correct documentation.   Since that day it's been nothing but disrespect out of his mouth towards me making the environment uncomfortable and ### high.Now I will take away from his behaviour and focus on what is wrong in the shop.  The electricity is not up to code you plug one thing in and it blows a fuse.  The kitchen can't even hold the power of a microwave without blowing fuses.  It's incredibly unsafe yet we don't say anything in fear he will Kick us out and finding a proper shop in today's times is not an easy task.  Next the roof.  The roof leaked for years damaging the property of my bf.  Again in fear of the LL ending his tenancy he never fought for his rights on this.   After about 8-### the roof finally gave way on the landlord's side forcing him into repairs.   The mess that was left afterward still to this day several months later has caused irreversible damages to my bf's property and parts he needs to succeed. Transmission valve bodies destroyed ### filled with water and debris computers rained upon his ### filled with water... rotors brakes and other automotive parts ruined with ### and debris.   The amount of stuff we've had to toss out due to damages is incomprehensible.  Yet my bf says nothing in fear the landlord will kick him out. The LL has prevented my bf's shop from being open on Saturdays.  He's been open on Saturdays since the beginning of time.  The LL decides to have work done and backs a dump truck right in front of my bf's shop door causing him to have to close for the day no one arranged this with him.  It just showed up and he had to close.  On several other occasions he's allowed another tenant one who owns the dance studio above to take over the parking lot causing my bf's shop again to have to close.  No one spoke to him about this made arrangements nothing.  Shouldn't something like this has to be set-up ahead of time?The LL allows his friends to come to hang out at all hours smoking inside the shops.  We've posted signs we've even complained to the state in which they sent a letter reprimanding him.  This deemed his 2nd attack on me.  Verbally attacking me. Threatening me that I will not be welcomed here.  Then there's what happens after 5.  When his grandson and all his friends come to work on their own vehicles and hang out and smoke pot (Which I might add happens throughout the day with his employees causing both shops to ### of marijuana)  We've had stuff stolen and therefore put up cameras.  Recently one of the grandson's friends robbed ###'s bf's care causing over $###. I've caught the LL on several occasions trying to cover the camera not aware that I was home watching.  When I  said something through the camera alerting him to my knowledge of what he was attempting. this only angered him more.You'd think with his disgust of me would stop the ### comments and stares but he still makes them within ear's reach and let me point out I do not dress in a manner to encourage this.  I wear appropriate office attire.  I dismiss them as it is already uncomfortable enough but this is not a brothel.  I do not need to be spoken of in a foul manner and gawked at.Now let's talk about his continuous bashing of my bf's business.  My bf has an honest reputation works hard provides for his family.  Doesn't steal lie or mislead consumers.  He runs an honest business and has decades of following to prove this.  Yet the LL cannot help himself but continuously ### my bf and his business.  Trying to turn consumers away from him. Are there not laws on defamation? So I bring it around to the most recent attack on me last weekend Friday night.  There was a power outage.  We hold late hours here at our shop and we're just about to close up while the ### grandson and his friends were on their side of the shop working on their personal projects.  It was about ### perhaps later and the power went out.Turned out that the cause had to do with wires going to the telephone pole outside the building.  It was no one's fault.  I came in Saturday to help in the office turned on everything as I normally do.   Around ### the hot dog truck that rents the spot in front of the building comes in and he plugs his heater into the ### and blows the power on our side of the building.  The LL waits until my bf leaves to check the fuse box and attacks me telling me that I am destroying the business and that I can not use the electricity.  That I have no rights to be here and I need to be gone.   The only thing I respond to him is "Please do not speak to me in that manner I am a human I do not work for you and I deserve to be respected."  Of course there is much more I want to say but after the previous interactions with him I bite my tongue as I do not want to say anything to affect my bf's tenancy here.   The LL goes on to say that if my bf doesn't get rid of me then he's going to have to negotiate the lease and wants him out of here.   I was so violated by the ### attack that I couldn't come to help out at the shop the following day.  He's made it incredibly uncomfortable along with the environment already unsafe.Just this morning I overheard the LL turn a potential consumer looking for my bf away even though I was here in the office.  Now I have proof that he is standing in the way of my bf's business profiting.Now there are years and years of other things that have been going on between the two men but I can only provide information on what I have witnessed and experienced myself and from this information alone I feel that my bf and his business are suffering.As a tenant who pays his rent on time.   What are his rights?  I am very aware of LL-tenant laws in residential but admit I am clueless in business.   I know the easy solution is to move out and we have been looking for properties but it isn't as easy as that.   Are we to sit here and be bullied and have business affected by an ### LL since there hasn't been an updated lease since he moved here over a decade ago?  What can I do to help protect my bf's business's reputation and not sit back and see him continuously abused because we're not familiar with the laws?  Any and all advice will be greatly appreciated.   Thanks"44158.8034722222 Would he have a case against the LL for the building not being maintained, improper (fire hazard) electrical, defamation, etc, that is what I'm trying to find out now,  I know there are links and online information regarding the laws for residential, but I end up in circles looking for commercial real estate laws.  Is there something like this I can familiarize myself with before reaching out to a lawyer.44159.04375 You have lots of issues to deal with it seems.  Again, this is his fight as the person with the contract.  He needs to deal with this, not you.  He needs to stand up to the LL.  If he can prove he has been paying on the contract and claim nothing has changed or what has changed you can use the original lease as the base.It might not be worth the cost of the fight.  You will spend more money and get nothing out of it financially except spending more money.  Save the money to use as a deposit somewhere else.  He can even send a letter to the landlord withholding rent due to the violations of the lease and once they are resolved he will pay the withheld rent.  But, they may never get fixed.Good luck,Mike44161.7958333333 First time it happened or first time you've been caught?  Yes, you should get an attorney.

I will not purchase anything in bulk or have an inventory but I will be purchasing clothes and accessories at wholesale price. I'm just wondering what the proper licenses I should have would be. I will not have any employees, it will just be me and the service I pay for through CCWholesale Clothing (they offer a drop-shipping service for a monthly fee). I know New ### exempts sales tax on clothing/accessories that isn't made out of fur but I'd like some personal clarification on it from a lawyer, not just from the internet.

Sales tax is based on the state that the sale is taking place.  In other words, where the customer is living.having the item shipped to.  The state where customer has item shipped is the state that you collect sales tax based on their laws and pay it most likely quarterly to that state.  Sometimes the service you are using like Shopify might handle all the sales tax for you.  You should check into that to see if they help because if not it is a lot of work to keep up with all ###.Since your business is based in ###, you will also need to register the business at the ### business portal website.  You will need to check on name availability to make sure no one else has the business name in the state.  You will need to decide what type of business entity you want to operate as.  You will also need to apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) with the IRS and use that as your business ID ### for a business bank account etc.  Also, most business checking accounts require at least a minimum $###.Setting up a business the correct way takes time and is something that cannot be done through this service in detail.

These gaps cause a very uncomfortable clicking sensation when eating. When I asked the dentist about this she explained the gums would "grow back" to fill in the gap eventually. A claim I recently discovered was false as the gaps are still present.It has been just over a month since my permanent crowns were cemented and my issues have only grown worse. Nothing my dentist has done has helped.I am now in a state of almost constant physical discomfort and have more issues with my teeth than I did when I initially came in to see the dentist.

He told us that he would be giving the dog to us as long as at some point he may use her to breed ###. Eventually we discovered that she was no longer able to get pregnant seeing that her period became irregular.

We have now poured countless amounts of time, resources, and love into our dog who we have had now for ###. Around ###20, our uncle once again asked us to house another dog that he was not able to care for under the same agreement.

We no longer want to allow my uncle to breed the dog, something we never supported nor liked the idea of, and are wondering what exactly can be done in order to ensure that this does not happen.

What can we do?44201.0652777778 Have the dogs ###.  Then they can't breed.  Or is it that you want to breed them and sell the puppies yourself?  Is your uncle a professional dog breeder or a backyard breeder?  Has either dog been used for breeding yet in their life?###44201.0736111111 Just go to the township and license the dogs.  Not sure what you mean by he registered them.  Registered where?###44201.1611111111 Neutering them ourselves and not telling him has been an option that we have considered (we certainly do not want to breed any of our dogs we do not support it) but unfortunately we arenâ€™t entirely sure if our dogs have actual licenses and we worry that if we inquire about them from my Uncle then ### become defensive and suspicious that weâ€™re reviewing legal options. I am not sure if my Uncle is a backyard breeder or a professional one. As for whether or not any of the dogs has been bred before, the answer is yes. The first dog that we had received (in 2018) had been impregnated before but had lost her entire litter due to the fact that she was too young at the time of her pregnancy. For this reason, and many others, we no longer want to force either of them to go through that. I understand that there isnâ€™t much information to go off of but is there any way for us to check ourselves if the dogs have been registered by the state or any other helpful options? 44201.1173611111 Okay we will look into just licensing them. As for the â€œregisteringâ€ I meant I was not sure whether or not my Uncle has already licensed them. Weâ€™ve never asked for the licenses or anything.44201.1645833333 They have to be licensed every year to prove you are still owner of dog a that it is current with its ### shots.  You get tags wit the registration so if he never gave those tags to you I doubt he ever licensed them.44201.1715277778 What you mean you don't know if your dogs are licensed?  You have to fill out an application with your town, pay the fee, and get the tags.  It is state law and most likely a law in your town.Who has been paying for veterinarian bills for heir annual checkups or other needed care?  Whose ownership info is on that paperwork?  Who pays for those bills?  Does your uncle pay for their car, their food, etc., and you just keep them at your home?  Lots of things that you need to put together to prove ownership.  If you have enough, you can claim he gave them to you as a gift.  With all that other proof it makes it look like you are the true owners.###44201.1263888889 With full transparency, this â€œexchangeâ€ was all done with an honest system meaning we never asked for a license seeing as this was the first time we did something like this. I want to say that my Uncle registered them but Iâ€™m just not entirely sure. I know this was irresponsible of us but that is why weâ€™re trying to fix our mistakes. As for the second dog we took in, we fully pay for all housing, food, vet bills, etc. so yes, that is something we can prove. Iâ€™m a little relieved to know that this may help our case. We have been the full and true owners of both dogs and will continue to be. So should we be trying to inquire about those licenses? Would that be a smart first step?44201.1409722222 In the spring I took in a mentally challenge homeless lady.

An eviction for non-payment of rent will not happen due to the moratorium executive order.  But, if there are other issues that are permitted by the eviction law, you can use those and request an eviction.  Since you are an owner occupier there are shorter timelines for the Notice to Quit which you need to give to her first and then give her the Notice to Vacate and file for the eviction.  The key is the timing and make sure you follow the proper sequence and timing for each.  The information for eviction is on the Department of Community Affairs website.  But, to make sure things go correctly you should consult with a local landlord/tenant attorney and have them do it for you since the hearings are still remote and there is a long wait and backup in the courts for these cases.###44203.5902777778 In the spring I took in a mentally challenge homeless lady.

As far as the items you claim were thrown out it will be an evidence and proof type of issue.  The other problem is even if you get a judgment against her you will probably never see the money.  If she is on public assistance and unemployed there is nothing you can legally collect against her after you get the judgment.  Your best bet is to protect anything else from ### (lock things up in a room, etc., maybe put key locks on some of the doors for rooms you keep items in so she can't get to them.

We went through rounds of doctors and treatments no one can figure his case out. Now we are almost ###. In that time I have quit my job to become his full time caretaker, he is deemed disabled and gets SSI which is our only source of income and got our own apartment since we moved out of his parents house. Weâ€™ve been out of their house for a little over ###.Now this is where I explain that the reason we moved is because of his parents. His parents were not helping me when they said they would when trying to take care of my husband when I was working. I would get phone calls at work to come home because they couldnâ€™t handle him. Even the littlest things. a lot of fighting and nonsense. Which effected my husbandâ€™s health issues as well. Wasnâ€™t needed whatsoever. We moved out and really wanted no contact with them because of how things were handled. So fast forward to now. They are trying to go after me for not allowing visitation to my husband. They had a lawyer right up a letter stating that I should allow them to my home to see my husband. I always put into consideration that they are his parents before I made decisions that goes against them. But when it comes to my husbands health and mine as well. We are adults and legally married and we have the right who we want contact with. On top of that they had an officer at my door checking on the welfare of my husband because adult protective services were called by his parents. When they know I take care of my husband. What rights do I have and what can I do? Iâ€™m already legally married to him and medical power of attorney. Is there anythingThis shouldnâ€™t be going where it is but his parents are so selfish and donâ€™t see how much hurt they are causing. They are also having sources watching me and get information from sources instead of just talking to me. So the line of trust is gone. My husband canâ€™t speak so he canâ€™t advocate for himself so Iâ€™m the one who does that for him. He canâ€™t see and canâ€™t walk.

I am contacting you today for some guidance on any legal options that I may have to recover my piano from my motherâ€™s house. I received the piano 14-###â€™s aunt as a Christmas gift, it being hers and then my ### before it being passed onto me. I do not have any formal documentation to prove this, but I have witnesses that could confirm that the piano is in fact mine. My parents are divorced, and my mother still occupies the marital home where my piano is, and this home is currently in foreclosure with the bank confirming that they will effectively repossess the house in the coming months. I have asked many times that my mother allow my father to take the piano to his apartment, it being a family ### from his side, and his apartment being a safe place for my piano in the case of repossession of the house. She ignores my requests. What further complicates this is that my mother had filed a restraining order against my father (that she herself has violated on multiple occasions), and so if my father goes over with a moving truck, she can very easily call the police on him causing him major legal issues. I am currently studying abroad in ###, France, and so my dad is the only one who can do this for me. I donâ€™t know what to do because she seems to be holding my piano hostage just to spite me. Are there any legal avenues I can take so that my father may be permitted to recover my piano at her house? Thank you very much for your time. 44208.54375 If your mother won't agree to it, you will have to file a complaint in court and get a court order that can then be enforced to remove the piano.  Your best course of action is to find a local attorney to help in the process.  You can contact the county bar association in your area for a referral.Good luck###44208.8368055556 This site can give some general guidance, but without lots of details cannot give you detailed solutions.  It seems in your situation you will need an attorney if you are out of the country.  You would have to be in the country for the hearing (possibly get one remotely during this pandemic but that might end soon).  There are timing issues.  There are issues with being able to contact the court, file actual signed papers at times, serving the complaint on the defendant, etc., that will be very difficult from across the ###.You will need to file an Order to Show Cause and a Verified Complaint for a start.  But if you do it wrong or miss any deadlines it will be a was of time.  If this piano is worth a good price and not just sentimental with no monetary value, it might not be worth the the time, cost, and effort.  Again, if you can't get your mother to agree to some plan to move it, and you need the courts you should use a local attorney.  Maybe your father can help with the cost.Why don't you ask your mother if you can get someone else, like actual piano movers to get the piano, instead of your father who has a restraining order?  There is nothing that says your father can't arrange for the moving of the piano, he just can't be there.###44209.0541666667 My landlord filed eviction papers for nonpayment  of rent.

I'm TECHNICALLY NOT A ESSENTIAL WORKER .  44214.0659722222 Yes, you were still available to work if it is available.  You weren't choosing to not work.  There wasn't a stay at home" order that prevented you from working somewhere.  There was a stay home please to help reduce the spread request.  There were pseudo curfews where police in some areas stopped you if you were out at night when not needed to be.  Every person's situation is different depending on their health.  The state shutting down certain businesses is a whole different issue. Even if your own business wasn't able to make money you were physically able to work.  That status is what allows you to collect unemployment.  Voluntarily choosing to not work is what disqualifies people from unemployment.  People were applying for jobs might not be what you want to do but it is a paycheck until things change.

You need to contact the Unemployment agency and ask how to correct the filing.  Follow their procedures.  As far as Covid, you don't get to choose that you can't work unless you have a legitimate health concern due to immune-compromise or something and you need to follow the state's rules and your employer rules on how to notify both of the issue and your request to be excused.

Cards were taken out in my name when I was ###(###, my actual DOB is ###). The thief paid the company back until May of 2013, and the collection agency â€œPortfolio Recoveryâ€ came after me in 2018. I disputed it, after my mentally unstable mother flipped out at me for answering the call from the collections, and insisted she would finish handling it. I never received my stimulus money, and have reason to believe that she managed to get it by claiming me as a resident of her household, when I do not reside with her.

My birth certificate â€œpoofedâ€, the paperwork from Portfolio Recovery â€œpoofedâ€. Iâ€™m pretty sure she had something to do with that. I am going to try to go to the courthouse ASAP to get a copy of my birth certificate, and Iâ€™m going to try to call Portfolio Recovery tomorrow to try to obtain the paperwork that they had sent me. I need to know how to go about this issue, as Iâ€™m concerned that she might still be trying to take out accounts in my name, and that she might be stealing my stimulus money. This also concerns me with tax season coming up, and the fact that Iâ€™m young and have never had a credit card, and she probably ruined my ability to obtain any credit.

Is that the case? Like I said, I'm waiting for the replacement which hasn't come. I'm a tech person. I deal with tech companies all the time. ALL of the others I've dealt with send the replacement FIRST and the replacement comes with the instructions, mailing labels, etc. for the return.  Why don't I have a case here, especially with them violating the ### Act and the TCCWNA?44226.6527777778 I don't see a case and your time just to do all your research without reading the warranty took more time in cost than the headphones.https://www.kingston.com/unitedstates/us/company/warrantyThe warranty claim process is pretty clear.   You return and they either repair or replace based on the problem.Follow their process and get your completely working headphones.  You have to follow their warranty policy first before you have an issue that might even be a case.  At this point you don't have a case because you didn't follow their written warranty claim process.###44226.6395833333 I purchased a ### with microphone from ### in July. The ### has a function where if you swivel up the microphone, the microphone would ###. By October, this function no longer worked. I contacted the company since the headphones had a ###. They agreed to replace the headphones and issued an RMA. I have not yet received the replacement.  They claim that I have to send them the item first but that is not stated anywhere in the warranty. The warranty notice says nothing about when they will send the replacement, whether it would be immediately, 6-###, or what. I need the headphones for zoom meetings and cannot be without their use for some unknown indefinite time. I can use them even though they don't ### properly.I reviewed their warranty and, IMO, there are multiple violations of the ### Act: they don't list a step by step process for invoking the warranty, they don't say when they will replace the item, they require a duty other than notification (i.e. return of the product), and they have not remedied the issue in a reasonable time among other things. They also state in their warranty that they own the item as soon as they receive it. I feel this violates the ### Truth in Consumer Contracts, Warranty and Notice Act as it violates my clearly established legal rights, especially the right of ownership of property. They are taking ownership of my property before they've paid" for it by refunding my money or replacing the item.The TCCWNA says that I'm entitled to $### or both at my discretion. Is that $###?If I file in small claims court do I list all the violations of the ### Act or do I just say that they haven't replaced my defective item? Do I also make a claim about implied warranty of merchantability? Or a claim under the Consumer Fraud Act?Do I have a case and if so how do I proceed and for what amount? The cost of the item? The cost of the item plus the $###? The cost of item plus $###?The company btw does not have any physical presence in ###.

If you can contact me by e-mail (###) I can forward the warranty to you if needed."44226.6027777778 Oh, and btw, all of that regarding the M-M act is beside the point. They also say that they own the product as soon as they receive it. Before they've paid for it.  Try that sometime: go into a store and take something off the ###, and tell them you'll pay for it later, and some indefinite ### time. Nowhere in their warranty" do they say when they will "pay" for the item that they are claiming ownership of taking away any rights I have to it.An RMA is not a promise to pay. It's a "Return Merchandise Authorization". That's it.  It's not even an "IOU".  Why should I give up my property rights before they've paid for the property?"44226.9375 This is what is wrong with this site, and with attorneys like you, who respond without knowing all the facts.They already stated they would replace it. Therefore, there is no checking to see if I damaged it and they essentially lost that right. I followed the warranty as far as it goes. They said they would replace it. They haven't. They already issued an RMA. They haven't replaced it. Nowhere in the warranty does it say anything that I have to return the product before they will replace it. They only say that I have to return the product within ###. They could send the replacement, I receive it, I put the old product in that box, attach the label, and send it back within the ###. Nowhere does it say that that is NOT the procedure. That is what all other tech companies do. And there's such a thing as industry standards"...The warranty says "you may return..." it does not say "you must return..." in order to activate the warranty.  Just because they have a page about the ### Act does not mean that they are in compliance with it. Many companies say that they are equal opportunity employers and link to or quote the federal pages but still discriminate against ### women the disabled and other protected groups. If all if took to avoid lawsuits was to quote the laws on their websites you'd be out of business.They fail to comply with the ### Act in the following ways IMO:It does not have a step-by-step procedure US Code Â§2302(a)(7)The warranty does not include the time at which the ### will perform Â§2302(a)(10)The warranty does not state the period of time within which after notice of a defect the ### will perform Â§2302(a)(11)The ### cannot require return first because it constitutes a duty other than notification Â§2304(b)(1)The warranty does not state in clear and conspicuous terms that the product must be returned first Â§2304(b)(2)If I could find a local attorney to take the case I would.  So far every attorney has either not bothered to respond or has responded with some ### on "it's not worth my time" and telling me to file in Small Claims Court.If you're not going to answer the questions I asked in my original post then don't bother responding.

The interest is determined by the courts when the collection is done through the court, but at half a percent or so a year it isn't much.  Is the party you won against judgment proof or will you be able to use court collection procedures?  They can also fight the interest if you just sit on the judgment and tryto collect much later after some interest ###.  You are supposed to actively try to collect on the judgment.44238.1201388889 Ok  For that small amount yes, you wouldn't be recording the judgment at this point.  That is for if you want to try for a wage garnishment or putting a lien on house, etc.  Does the judgment say plus interest and costs,, or anything like that?  Usually for such a small amount interest isn't considered at this point and not until you need to record the judgment for statewide enforcement.What is the docket number of the case?  Is this a tenant security deposit issue or some other security deposit?  Also, is the person judgment proof (i.e., only income is SS or disability, etc.)?Collecting after a judgment is not guaranteed and sometimes not worth the amount of time for what you might finally get paid.Good luck,Mike44238.5909722222 Please provide a copy of the judgment.

Even the larger amounts in special civil have to be docketed (or recorded is another ### in explaining it) with the Clerk before starting collection proceedings.AS to interest, Court Rule 4:42-###.

Judge's order was for defendant to make a payment within ### ###. On information subpoena I need to list judgement amount as well as amount outstanding including interest.
