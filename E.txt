Happy New Year!43852.7340277778 Put in a request for son's ### notes. School refused to turn them over. Complained and received an email from the school's attorney. Attorney advised us that I have been informed you have reported to the Department of Public Instruction that you have been denied access to your sonâ€™s education records on multiple occasions by the ### County Schools.  This is not correct." and later she stated "you also asked about why OT notes were not included in the file you saw.  The notes of an OT or any teacher which are created and kept by that OT or teacher are for that individualâ€™s reference.  The federal regulations pursuant to ### state that a ### education record does not include â€œ[### that are kept in the sole possession of the maker are used only as a personal memory aid and are not accessible or revealed to any other person.â€  ###.F.R. Â§ ###  This was the case here with regard to the ### notes and this is why they were not in the file." (Bold face for emphasis) We have email records that show the Occupational Therapist emailed our son's OT notes to other people in the school system. We pointed this out and still have not received the notes. It's been months. I found the email from the attorney to be very intimidating. The Dept of Education stopped communicating with us because I'm assuming the attorney told them we are not being truthful when in fact we are. It's the attorney that is not being truthful. And we are paying the price. Can I file a complaint against her? Thank you for an input or help."43839.9375 Iâ€™m sorry you have had such a difficult time with your childâ€™s school. Your submission touched on a couple different subjects so I wanted to take a moment to try and address each of the issues you raised.Unfortunately, generally speaking, there is very little recourse available for school bus suspensions and there is no formal right to appeal a bus suspension. However, a school bus suspension should normally only be employed by the school if the behavior that triggered the suspension is somehow related to activity on or related to the school bus. Otherwise, in-school suspension or a short-term suspension may be the more appropriate remedy for the school system to use. If a bus suspension is imposed, you can always reach out to the school and request a meeting to suggest an alternative punishment. Additionally, the school system is required to have a grievance procedure. If you can identify a school system policy that the school violated or ### in issuing the bus suspension, you can pursue a grievance through the school systemâ€™s grievance policy.That being said, students who have a disability are entitled to certain protections that may help provide your child with more recourse moving forward. First, you referenced your childâ€™s ###. Section ### ###, in part, that â€œ[### otherwise qualified individual with handicaps in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance....â€ Because public school systems receive federal funding, they must comply with this act. In the realm of education, the Act is intended to protect students with disabilities so that they have equal access to the school and learning environment. However, one thing to keep in mind about ###, but they are not designed to provide specialized instruction to students.When a student has a disability, that disability impacts their learning or their ability to participate in the school environment, and the student requires specially designed instruction to address the disability and the ### learning, then a student may be better served by an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) rather than a ###. In order to qualify for an IEP, a student must meet certain eligibility requirements and must also have one of certain enumerated disabilities or categories. One category is â€œOther Health Impairmentâ€ which often ### students with ADHD. The reason an IEP may be more helpful than a ###â€™s learning rather than just accommodations. I mention this only because you referenced that the current ###â€™t seem to be working. Another benefit of an IEP is that special transportation can be added to your childâ€™s IEP if, for example, your child keeps getting bus suspensions and the behaviors leading to the suspensions are related to the childâ€™s disability. Additionally, if your child ### in behaviors that are impacting her learning, ### in a pattern of similar behaviors, or your child is at-risk of multiple suspensions, it may be worth requesting a functional behavior assessment (FBA). An FBA is a process by which a student is evaluated to try and identify what is causing the behaviors that the student is engaging in that interferes with learning so that a plan can be created to address those behaviors. After an FBA is conducted, the information from the FBA should be used to develop a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP). This BIP should create a plan to try and prevent the triggers of the unwanted behaviors, reinforce positive behaviors, and create a plan for de-escalating any behavior-related incidents. For either a student with a ###, the student is entitled to additional protections if suspended, particularly if long-term suspended. If the student is long-term suspended (for more than ###) or is short-term suspended on multiple occasions for a pattern of similar behaviors so that the student has, in total, been suspended for more than ###, then the school system is supposed to conduct a Manifestation Determination Review (MDR). An MDR is a meeting whereby it is determined whether or not the behavior that led to the suspension is closely related to the ### disability or if it was the result of the school failing to implement the students ###/IEP. If the behavior that led to the suspension is closely related to the ### disability or the failure of the school to implement the ### plan, then the suspension should not be upheld and the student should be returned to their original placement (unless other factors about the situation warrant otherwise).You also referenced that your child was suspended for the semester and you attempted to challenge it, but that you were told you had no other option but to comply with the suspension. Under North Carolina law, students have due process protections that allow them the right to challenge long-term suspensions (or suspensions of more than ###). Part of those protections include the right to a written notice of the suspension and a hearing. Take a look at North Carolina General Statutes 115C-390.### 115C-390.8. These lay out a ### due process and hearing rights when long-term suspended. Finally, you mentioned that whenever you reach out to the school, you do not receive prompt responses in return. While there is no perfect fix to this problem, it is often best to put any requests you may have in writing and for you to keep a copy of the writing. That way, you can document the efforts you made to speak with the school about your concerns. Additionally, if the things you wish to discuss are related to your childâ€™s ### (or IEP if a student has an IEP), you can always request to convene a meeting to address the issues with the plan or the concerns you have. If the school fails to address your concerns with regards to your childâ€™s ### (or IEP) there are additional hearing rights that you can pursue. One resource that can be really helpful is Legal Aid of North ### Advocates for Childrenâ€™s Services website. It has a lot of helpful information and some sample documents that may be useful. Here is a link to the website: http://www.legalaidnc.org/acs. I wish you the best moving forward.43931.5763888889 My child has been placed at an alternative school due to behavioral issues at her school while she was in the 9th grade. She has ADHD & ### defiant disorder which is being treated for her doctor. This is documented with the school & it took me a year to get ###. Within that year she was suspended from school so many times that she barely passed so they decided to send her to the alternative for ###. Since she arrived at this school the administrative staff have been a nightmare to deal with. They do not respond to email, constantly blame other people for issues that happen and their solution for problems is yet again to suspend her. I had to go the superintendent to get the ###/ disabilities. In September she was suspended because they claimed she brought alcohol to school but they never had proof, she was not in possession & not intoxicated. They suspended her for the semester, I tried to fight it but was told that I had no other option & that she had to stay at home & do the tier ###. She returned to school on ### & was told that she will have to complete the rest of this year at the alternative school before they can send her back to her home school which we are happy to hear! Upon her return she has been on her best behavior with no issues because she wants to be out of this school. Last night she tells me that the assistant principal made her sign a paper that states if she gets in trouble ### & that I will be responsible for transporting her. I asked her why he had her sign this & she didn't know, she hasn't done anything but thinks that they are trying to get her kicked off the bus. If she is kicked off the bus she would have no way to school as I work & cant transport which they are aware of. If they are successful in this that means she will not be able to complete the semester at school which means she cant leave the school & return to her home school. I am trying my best to protect her but at this point I feel I am hitting walls! They are bullying her & the ###. I am a single mom of ### & they are making it hard in me. She deserves to get her education & unfortunately wants to drop out because of them. I cant let this happen, she is a smart girl with a bright future! The trouble she has been involved in was never really bad enough for the school to treat her this way & the ### that they are giving her are very harsh!43867.7041666667 Thank you for all the information I appreciate your help!43931.6319444444 Any updates?44183.8826388889 Based on what I wrote theyâ€™re going to decide whether or not I deserve another hearing. How do you think itâ€™s going to go?44174.7972222222 Correction: I have access to my work, but not to the original question. 44166.7430555556 Haha will do!! 44203.8159722222 Hi! It didn't go well. The Academic Integrity Facilitator said I'm guilty, so I appealed his verdict and I'm waiting on a response for the board. Thank you for asking.44174.0645833333 I didn't Google the answer, and I don't have a copy of the exam unfortunately. In an email my professor sent me she told me which question looked like I had cheated. Hypothetically speaking, if I did cheat the only way would be through someone else in my class. I don't know anyone from my university because everything is online. I wrote a letter defending myself, and it also explains the situation a better. I will attach it below. Any advice or information you can give me will be extremely helpful. Thank you so much. Also, please let me know if you want a copy of my work for that specific question. 44166.0256944444 I donâ€™t know who else I can contact about this. Other than making an appeal, I donâ€™t know what else I can do. And yes it is about one question. Iâ€™ll attach his official letter of findings below. 44174.1888888889 I have been accused of cheating on a ### exam in my college calculus class. The consequences are being failed or suspended. I have a hearing scheduled soon. They said I have the work and answer for a question that wasn't on my exam. I don't know what to do. My university is online b/c of COVID. I have the right to be present at the hearing, or to submit a written statement. I'd prefer to submit a well written statement so that I don't say anything that can be used against me. I didn't cheat and I feel like there's no way to prove it. Please help.44165.8194444444 I have my work, but because the question is copyrighted by my university I do not have access to it. Here is my work, the question that is under question is #7. I sent my letter because it's what I'm going to be submitting to the panel who is reviewing my case. I wanted to know what I should change. 44166.7423611111 I personally don't see how if it was that one answer.  I can see how you made mistakes and those mistakes carried to the end.  You also mixed up the process of the differential equation.  Not sure how to help in the academic realm since they are their own little government.  Have you talked to other leadership at the school and explined how you don't know how it can be cheating when you make mathematical errors and don't do a problem perfectly correct but it gets close and after looking at it you can see where the mistakes were made to be able to get the correct answer?  Is it really just about this one problem on the exam?44174.1041666667 In the appeal I would still state the reasons for the possible mistakes.  Then bring up if you were cheating wouldn't there me more coincidences throughout the entire exam.  The fact that you could use a calculator and you didn't because you just did it in your head and got it wrong which isn't that uncommon to make small mistakes when dividing numbers.  And again the C=###'t understand the problem and made a mistake.  You are not a professor, but a student, and are going to make mistakes.  You understand that not get credit for this one question, but if he rest have no evidence of possible cheating then the accuser is stretching to reach the conclusion of cheating when there are very ### explanations for the mistakes.  Maybe the professor should make the ###'t close.###44174.1958333333 Is the first equation in ###?44166.8138888889 Is what you wrote a copy of the question from the exam as the first line of solving the problem?44167.8513888889 It was on the exam.44167.1090277778 Just got the answer back yesterday, appeal changed nothing unfortunately :(. I really appreciate your time and effort though. I honestly just want to get past this whole situation. I passed the class and in the end thatâ€™s all that matters. If I ever get into another ### in the future, which Iâ€™m hoping I never do, I will definitely contact you again, if thatâ€™s okay with you. Thank you again!!!!!!!44203.1326388889 My phone number is ###-###, and my email is ### Text is the best way, email is alright too. Thank you for your help!44168.0847222222 No idea.  I would think if they are a fair organization they would allow you to have a hearing.44174.8048611111 Nope, still havenâ€™t heard from anyone. I emailed the person in charge of appeals a while ago and still nothing. 44183.9888888889 Ok.  Thanks for the update.  Hopefully you gave enough info to show that the issue was not cheating.  Good luck.44193.7263888889 Okay thank you for your help. Iâ€™ll keep you updated. 44174.81875 So to hear that.  How about no more scuffles in the future!Take care44203.1486111111 So, how did it go?44173.7180555556 Thank you ###! I appreciate your help. I unfortunately filed the appeal a few days ago and Iâ€™ll attach it below. Let me know if you think what I said was alright. Thank you again. 44174.6715277778 Thanks!!44193.7604166667 That's ok.  Will there be a hearing or is it just based on what you wrote?44174.7194444444 The first line I wrote was the question that was on the exam. 44167.9006944444 They just sent me the question and you already have my work. I attached the original question below.44167.9090277778 They reviewed my case on ###rd and will tell me their verdict on ###th. 44193.6777777778 This plus ### 381.33 + 5 = ###.###44168.0833333333 We are talking a calculus exam, right?  Did they give you a copy of the answer they claim you wrote that doesn't answer any question on the exam?  Are you sure you didn't google the question and use a fake answer that is planted out there to catch cheaters?  If you had to show your work for the problem and the work isn't even close to fitting the problem (usually the first couple lines of work are similar to the problem and then things go wrong if you make a mistake) I can see how they could claim you cheated.I need to see a copy of the exam and the answer to the particular problem or problems they say you got nowhere near being correct.###44166.0076388889 Well, I did ask for a copy of the question and your work and answer.  Not sure why you sent the letter you wrotebut not the items I asked to review.44166.1215277778 Well, let's just say you totally ### the problem.  What is your phone number and email address?  I need to talk you through it and what you should be saying in the letter or in front of the board.This problem was basically an area under a ### problem plus ### ###.  I have no idea what you tried to do and where did c=###?  I can see why the prof thinks you answered a different problem and not the one in the exam.

He is ###. He has not been in physical intruction since 11/2021. the reason why is that school has not provided transportation for him. His IEP states that he is to recieve door to door transportaion to school and back. He is missing out on crucial services that I am not able to provide because I am not a trained therapist.

Before this occurs, I'm posting this reply.I cannot tell from what you wrote whether there was a technical violation of some kind.  If you wish to get a legal opinion as to whether (for example) what occurred was a HIPPA violation, you'd need to get all of the documents from the clinic admission and the relevant school forms and meet with an attorney.  However since it does not seem  that there were any actual or recoverable damages, I'm not sure why you would want to start spending money hiring a lawyer.It is also possible that the school nurse simply followed established protocol and was authorized to do what she did.  You may have also executed consent with the clinic which authorized the sharing of information with other medical professionals.  That is pretty standard.43478.8180555556 school nurse calls an tell me that my ### be in school because she called the clinc she went to an said they did not take samples so she has to go back .. clinic said shes lying they never told her she didnt have are didnt have a sample done ... an i feel that the confidentiality was breached on both parties cause nurse was suppose to  call me an clinic was not suppose to not give out any info about my daughter....43447.7145833333 Can a school psychologist put information given in confidence from a student into a publicly available school report, specifically referring to a father cheating on a mother as said by the student involved, during an individual evaluation.43479.3451388889 Can you clarify your question please?  What type of publicly available document was involved?  This means that anyone who wishes to see it can view it, and such action would be highly irregular.  It would also be very unusual for a school psychologist to make any personal information available to the public. Can you provide further details? Also, have you discussed this with the school psychologist?Thank you.43497.7756944444 I will leave this open for another ###.  Thank you.43498.5847222222 Can I upload photos?

I would suggest this is water under the bridge" now particularly six months into the school year.If you have an attorney regarding the legal custody issues you should discuss future options with your attorney.   If you do not have an attorney you should not further delay in retaining one if you wish to regain legal custody.There's no reason to upload photos or documents since you've explained that you don't even have legal custody.  I am closing this out now.  Thank you."43511.9611111111 Ms. ###,Your post needs some additional information to make sense.  This is February.  It would seem to be quite late to discuss your child's grade placement with the school six months into the school year.  How/why is the DSS Children's Division involved? 43509.9402777778 My now ### ### grade with her teacher from previous year or move on to 5th grade where she wouldn't know anyone and my child was held back against her father's and my consent by the children's division of state of Missouri even though she had an evaluation done before school even started and she was ranked as high as a 5th grader in the 9th month of their 5th grade year. Now I feel like they are setting her up for failure is there anything that I can do about this? 43509.4888888889 You should be able to upload photos.  However please explain why the Children's Division would be involved. 43511.9020833333 ###/cookie unknowingly. Forced to say she knew. ### ###. Letter recieved stating ### ###. Student questioned over ###. No cops involved. Should the school have called me sooner? Does that make the student in possession after taking ### without knowing? Can we fight this due to student not knowing yet getting suspended? Student no trouble before. Teachers were present in area during hand ###. Yet didn't notice.   43528.9388888889 Sounds like a bad situation. Contact an education lawyer in your area for a consultation.  Youâ€™ll have to be able to come up with some money for legal fees, however, because it is unlikely that youâ€™ll find an attorney to work for free.  I hope things work out for your child. Yes, you can fight the suspension. 43531.1180555556 Dear Sir or Madam,            I am in a bind!!! My son has been having major issues at this school. From bullying (spitting, Verbal and physical abuse).  From the beginning of the school year, I voiced my advocacy in my son's life as well as his education. Thinking that maybe they would help me help them, that was not the case. It started with the unanswered emails that I've reached out to the school principal and teacher, to the ### of spit on his clothing, to the name call (###, bitch, threats that one kid wished that my son would die). I tried to reach out to the teacher through email with no response. Then I started calling and he wouldn't really investigate. He would ### the question or made it seem like my son was the culprit. He would always tell me that my son was an annoyance to some of the students in the classroom. My son is Autistic, which there are underlying issues with that alone. But my son has never been aggressive are harmful to such bad retaliation!! The straw that broke the camel's back was when my son told me and his father that one of the teacher side's in the classroom called him a stupid liar. I asked him why would he say that. My son said because he had gotten all of math question wrong on a test. That wasn't a good enough reason. So his father called the school the day after wanting to speak with the Principal and the teacher. He said the ### always in a meeting. So he talked with the teacher. His teacher said that he didn't say that, of course. I knew they would deny that. So his father asked about his Active IEP, what was they doing in ###? His father told me that he danced around the question but told his father that my son ### off" for ###. His father asked him how would he know if that what he was doing? His teacher said Well I've caught him numerous time. His father asked why would they allow a special needs child to go to the bathroom by himself knowing of this horrid habit?!! He asked where are the Aides in the classroom? Why is he left alone for ###?!! He never got an answer!!! He called me and told me to take him out the school."43565.75 Ms Brown,Attached is a ### publication concerning special education (and IEP issues).  It can also be downloaded here:  https://###.mo.gov/sites/default/files/The%20Parent%27s%20Guide%20to%20Special%20Education%20October%202017.pdfAlso attached is a lengthier St. ### City publication covering IEP procedures.You will likely find information relevant to your concerns in one or both of these publications. Without knowing what you have already attempted, it isn't possible to give you specific direction.  Generally speaking a parent with IEP concerns would speak to the teacher, principal and/or special school district personnel.  You may wish to request a group meeting to discuss your concerns.Best wishes.43566.7652777778 What should I do if my Autistic child IEP isn't getting followed at school?43565.7527777778 Answer stands.  Depends on the question asked: you have not been convicted yet, but you have plead guilty. 43713.9513888889 Hi, I have a felony possession charge for a controlled substance and was given an ### with ###. I'm about to start college and was going to attempt to file for ###. My question is, is my charge considered a felony? Like if i fill out the application and it asks if i have any felonies, do i answer yes? And if so, after the probation period, is it still a felony?43704.7673611111 It depends on how the question is asked. If it asks if you have ever pleaded guilty, you must answer yes. If it asks if you have ever been convicted of a felony, then it depends on if you successfully completed ### probation. If you did successfully complete ### probation and were discharged, and they ask if you have ever been convicted of a felony, the answer is no. Hope this helps. 43707.7694444444 Thanks! It does help! If i can ask another question, what if I'm still on probation? I am complying with the probation requirements but still have ###. 43707.7902777778 Hello a teacher took a picture of his classroom and ### it on his private Facebook page, thereâ€™s no sign permission form for him to post a picture with my granddaughter. HE also posted thru Donors choose to ask for donations for his classroom, in there policy it states that written permission is to be sent. Well I didnâ€™t provide written permission, why would they post her on their website? THAnks43707.0326388889 Ms. ###,Anyone CAN sue someone, however this is likely not appropriate for the situation you describe.  Even IF there might be a legal basis for such a lawsuit, it is difficult to see how your grandchild has been monetarily (or otherwise) damaged.  How would suing the teacher benefit the child?  You should want to foster a cooperative,  not adversarial, relationship with the teacher and school. If you have not already done so, you should schedule a conference with the teacher & principal to discuss your concerns.   Thank you.43707.2979166667 Thank you for your reply, I have had a meeting with the principal and teacher. The principal agreed that the teacher had no rights to post pictures of his classroom on social media without parent permission. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m seeking for legal assistance. Without attorney representation. What can I do now?43707.3048611111 I feel bad about your situation.

Hopefully, you kept good records of your communications or can at least ### a timeline.43731.8673611111 Ms. ###,This forum is for specific civil law questions.  There isn't a legal question in what you wrote, however the answer to what else to do" is that you need to hire an attorney to represent you and your daughter.  This is something you likely should have done immediately after your daughter was suspended.The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function here:  ###However the best recommendations often come from satisfied friends or family.  The next thing you need to do is to hire a lawyer.Best wishes."43739.1354166667 My daughter got into a fight on the bus and was suspended for ###. Then we went to the hearing and told them what happen then they called back a couple days later saying that she is suspended until the end of Dec. They will not tell me exactly why or what makes the fight worth the rest of the school year or who made the decision. She attends ### school district she is a six grader. I am requesting a hearing but would like advise on what else to do.43738.9159722222 Hi ###,No, she did not. First, HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) applies only to health plans (like insurance companies), health care providers, and companies that work with health plans and health care providers. HIPAA does not apply to schools or school districts.Further, HIPAA prevents only the unauthorized disclosure of protected health information." Protected health information is individually ### information relating to the past present or future health status of an individual that is created collected or transmitted or maintained by a ### entity in relation to the provision of healthcare payment for healthcare services or use in healthcare operations. Thus that there was a "hotline" on you is not protected health information.In summary the school counselor did not violate HIPAA because she is not a ### entity and that there was a "hotline" on you is not protected health information under HIPAA."43777.8819444444 My ex-husband and childrenâ€™s father called the school and told them there would be a CPS report on me for abuse of my children. There was no reports made. The school counselor called our families case managerâ€™s supervisor regarding another topic that was fabricated by my ex-husband and it was disclosed that there was a â€œhotlineâ€ on me. My question is, did the school counselor violate HIPPA laws by disclosing this information since there was no release of information form signed by myself or my ex-husband?43747.0284722222 Claims for defamation have been around since before this country was founded.  It has long been recognized that making false statements about someone to a third party is a basis for a defamation claim. Historically even alleging that a woman was not â€œ###â€ was deemed defamatory and a basis for damages.  These were cases of per se slander in that damages were presumed due to their very nature without any requirement to prove monetary damages actually sustained.Unfortunately, in Missouri that is no longer the law as the Missouri Supreme Court eliminated per se slander and libel about ###. Now you must prove actual monetary damages sustained as a result of the defamatory statements which is typically very difficult. No doubt being accused of such conduct is very upsetting and having to deal with addressing the issue is certainly taking your time and ###. But that doesnâ€™t amount to the legally ### damages necessary to successfully pursue such a case. Additionally, the US Supreme Court has ruled that opinions are protected speech under the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution. So to the extent any false allegation qualifies as an opinion it also cannot be a basis for a defamation claim. Lastly, in regard to the school counselor he/she has qualified immunity for any statements made which would protect the counselor from any such suit. Bottom line, I donâ€™t think it makes sense to try to pursue this via defamation. Instead I would arrange a sit down with the counselor to discuss these issues and your ex-husbandâ€™s misinformation. I would be careful not to let your emotions get the best of you as you will lose credibility.  You also donâ€™t want to come across as attacking the counselor or school but rather trying to clear up some misinformation that may be interfering with your childrenâ€™s education. Also be careful to avoid making defamatory statements about your ex as you donâ€™t need him filing a slander suit against you.  While he will have the same difficulties pursuing a case as outlined above you donâ€™t want to have to hire an attorney to assert those defenses. Iâ€™m sorry that you are having to deal with this but if you approach the school with respect you will likely accomplish far more than your ex-husbandâ€™s efforts to discredit you. Best of luck to you and your children. 43747.6243055556 My ex-husband and childrenâ€™s father called the school and told them there would be a CPS report on me for abuse of my children. There was no reports made. The school counselor called our families case managerâ€™s supervisor regarding another topic that was fabricated by my ex-husband and it was disclosed that there was a â€œhotlineâ€ on me. Is there any legal recourse I can take against either my Ex-husband or the school counselor. 43747.0375 Ms. ###,I have the feeling there is much more involved here.  It isn't clear from what you wrote why your daughter was suspended or even how the school found out about her drug use.  Regardless, I would start by looking for an attorney who handles school law related matters.  The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function, and you can select the school law" category:  ###Many of the attorneys listed represent school districts so you need to find a lawyer who handles student suspensions.  Best wishes.### "43751.9131944444 My ###. She's an honor student without prior disciplinary issues till this month.  She's kind, respectful and loving.

Yet the online course FINANCE ### - 001   ### in Business is misrepresented and does not reflect the advertised product as described in the university's course listing for Fall ###. The class is described as being 100% (one hundred percent) online and only requiring internet access. In addition the listing does not detail any requirement to be online at any certain time or day nor does it detail any particular equipment or requirement to use third-party software outside of the University of ###. ### online ### system. However those are the demands being required of students as of ### at 11:### "on Thursday ### at ###" via "the ### Testing Center or via [an outside vendor] ###".Moreover the vendor ### (https://www.###.com) requires additional equipment (camera and microphone) and assesses a fee for "scheduling tests within a ### window" that increases as the window ###.Requiring students to come on campus for any reason violates the description and function of the course as described in the course listing. Furthermore there is no such requirement to be on campus or for the use of any third-party provider or additional equipment even within the professor's syllabus which does contain a list of required technology.Further the FIRST exam ### was completely online and issued through the ### system. The use of ### is included in the syllabus as "Ability to navigate the ### Learning Management System".At this time I have contacted the professor multiple times through email (the professor and I have never had a phone conversation about this issue) as well as ### ### (Student Support ### at ### NOW) whom I have communicated with via phone and email on this matter. Dr. ### ###  (Finance Department Chair) and ### ### (Director of Undergraduate Advising) have been made aware of the situation but have not responded.After my last communication with the professor on ### where I expressed concern over the equipment required for the use of ### and prioritizing my education I purchased a ### for nearly $###.com. Two days later (once the ### arrived) I went to ###.com to schedule my exam to find that I would be assessed a fee of $###. I have paid the cost of tuition the School of Bussines fee and the online course fee. I refuse to pay to take a test. I have expressed that I want to withdraw with impunity from the course and I want a full refund of the tuition and fees I have paid.What are the legal ramifications of the professor's actions and do I have any rights as a paying consumer and student of the university?"43762.6868055556 Hi January:I am very sorry that the class was not as advertised and expected.  I also sometimes had this experience at colleges.  While you might be able to make a valid ### case, I do not believe this would be the most productive way for you to move forward.  Instead, I would recommend continuing to follow up with the leadership of the university.  In addition, most schools have some sort of form dispute resolution program.  While that program would most likely require you to attend in person, it might resolve the issue the way you want it resolved.If you do decide to pursue litigation rather than working with the school's dispute management program, be aware that an attorney will most likely want his/her fee paid up front.  Also, it will take time to move the case through the legal system and you could end up losing.Please give some thought to my suggestion.I wish you well in all your future endeavors.43770.6708333333 Dear Ms. ###,I am assuming the form was the standard blank one attached.  Your signature reflects an agreement to participate in the facilitated IEP and consent to release of the student's information to ###.  Since you didn't complete the basic  information section when you signed it, I see nothing wrong with the district completing it.  The section contains information like names, addresses and contact information. When you signed and left the blank form, a reasonable expectation would have been that the district would fill it out.  As far as the date on the form, this would be a harmless error - no harm no foul.  You neglected to write the date when you signed the form.  Unless you had notified the district in writing that you wanted to withdraw and revoke your agreement to participate in the FIEP meeting and release of information to ###, why would this even be a concern now?  You could still ask the district to amend the date on the form, but when you are working with others for the benefit of your child it is not beneficial to be difficult.  Since there was no mention of it in your post, I assume there was no prior revocation of your consent and the date on the form would be of no significance.This site does not permit questions regarding criminal law, but I don't see any forgery or other criminal offense here.  If you wish to pursue a complaint, you should follow the district's procedures.  However it would usually be in the best interests of your child to be as cooperative as possible (and not difficult) with school personnel, so that you are all amicably working together.  Since there already are issues requiring a facilitator to become involved, it would be best if you focused on how to best help your child and not on perceived issues about the process.Facilitated Individual Education Program (FIEP)Parents or school district staff may agree to conduct a facilitated IEP team meeting when both parties agree that it would be beneficial to have a neutral person assist the IEP team to ### and effectively address team concerns.  The neutral IEP facilitator helps to create an environment in which the IEP team members can listen to one anotherâ€™s points of view.  The neutral IEP facilitatorâ€™s role is to assist the IEP team to work together to build consensus in developing an IEP that meets the ### needs and is acceptable to both the parents and the school district.  This process is designed to be utilized when there is a sense from either of the parties that the issues at the IEP meeting may lead to significant disagreement or create an uncomfortable climate. IEP Facilitation is provided at no cost for IDEA-related cases and is requested through the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of Special Education.   https://###.mo.gov/special-education/compliance/facilitated-individualized-education-program-fiepI hope you and the district staff are able to work with the neutral IEP facilitator from ### in a friendly, non-adversarial and positive manner for the benefit of your child.  Best wishes.43856.9305555556 I signed the form in ###. I was instructed by district staff to ONLY sign, not date. There is actual highlighted areas on the form for the only parts district wanted me fill in/sign. The district then used the form from ### (###,###) without any notice to me. Iâ€™m not understanding how the district can keep a form on file to use whenever they want and not notify the parent. It was intended for a meeting in ### ###20.43856.9916666667 If you no longer want to agree to the FIEP meeting, then send a signed statement to ### and the school district that you are revoking your consent from the form previously signed.If you wish to have the FIEP meeting, I would suggest you move past this and forget it.  Proceed with the FIEP meeting and the issues that will be focused on there for your child.43857.21875 Would it be considered forgery, falsifying a document or fraud (any, all or none) for school district special education staff to keep a form (Facilitated Individual Education Program Meeting request and release of educational data form) ONLY signed ###,  then for the district staff to, in ###20, fill in the section of the form labeled for parent/guardian to complete AND write in a date by the parents signature, without consent from the parent? 43854.2388888889 Good afternoon,I am reaching out to you, because of an unfortunate incident thatoccurred while my son, ### Woods-O'Field was a minor.

He allegedly ### paper clip, and pointed it at his teacher,as if it was a gun. He was supposed to be suspended until the endof the school year ( I believe), and was told that he couldenroll in the middle school, after his suspension (the schoolyear was nearly over, so his suspension would have been for about###).  The following school year, we were not in ###school district, so he did not return until his 7th grade year. Upon enrolling, he had to start off at the alternative school,and after a semester, I was informed that ### would be able toattend his home school.  As it turned out, ### was only able tograduate with his home school, and was not able to participate inany sports, or other extracurricular activities,.### has always aspired to be a chef, and I was under theimpression that he would be able to attend ### Herndan TechnicalSchool (which is a part of the ### School System), forCulinary ###.  Because he was never released" from theAlternative school ### never had an opportunity to attend ###Herndan.  As a result of this he enrolled in Le ### Culinary### (which has since went out of business) and is now stuckwith $50###.  He can not attend anyother college because he cannot gain access to his transcript ordiploma and he doesn't have the money to repay the debt.

It wasn't until I was notified that in fact I had a conduct hearing that I was able to discuss and get a response about the situation; which was a completely different person and department. A while had gone by and I hadn't heard from them in a while and was told my case was pushed down so they could work on less complicated cases". The board found the ex roommate guilty in November to which she appealed for due process. So they reheard the entire case and found her guilty again in March. The board configured a dollar amount of restitution that she owed me. I didn't hear from the board again for two or three weeks. When I did they informed me that she appealed yet again. It has now been a week and for months all they tell me is either she appealed or that they will update me. The ex roommate graduates in May and I feel that the university is letting the case drag out until then so they don't legally have to do anything about the situation. Would I even be able to get an attorney involved against not only my ex roommate for the damages but also the school for neglecting to do anything which led to further destruction of my property and potentially my safety?

I am currently caring for ### in my home because his caregiver doesn't take ### out to exercise.  He also keeps the TV on all the time, which isn't as big a problem when ### can go to his day program.  The day program has been closed since ###.  Since I'm caring for ###, I am unable to go back to work.    It's all quite complex.  I hope I've given you an adequate overview of what we've got going on.I look forward to ### from you. Sincerely,### ### 43984.6270833333 Hi ### - I donâ€™t really have anything new to report. Grace is on vacation from ### until ###, so nothing has changed since my last note to you.  Did you see that one?### is staying with a temporary AFL until he can move in with ###  itâ€™s someone that he knows and lives with for ### ###/### (###) he moved and the wheels came off.  I see a pattern here!I hope you and your family are well and had a fun Fourth.Best,###44022.0354166667 Hi ### - I just wanted to update you, to keep you in the know. It looks like ### will be approved for a Section ###!  Weâ€™re still sorting out what we want to do with respect to where he will live.  For now, weâ€™re grateful that ### is in a good place at the temporary AFL. Iâ€™ll keep you posted as things progress. I hope youâ€™re well. Best regards,###44041.0222222222 Hi ### - nothing new to report, other than weâ€™ve set a date for ###â€™s annual plan meeting.  We will meet via zoom.  My hope is that his current/temporary caregiver (###) will be amenable to keeping ### for an indefinite period of time; allow him to use the section ### (the trickiest part) agree to let him break his lease with ###â€™s notice.  That would ensure that ### can keep the voucher without committing to exactly when he will use it somewhere else.  I reached out to Grace several times to ask her to keep us updated on how things are going for both her mom and the question of who will care for ###.  Unless I ask specific questions, I donâ€™t hear anything from Grace.  One of my pet peeves is poor communication. If this is how things would be with our â€œboysâ€ sharing a home, Iâ€™m concerned. I would prefer to hear SOMETHING, even if itâ€™s to say that nothing has changed.  The beauty of the voucher is that I can use it to pay ###â€™s rent wherever he is, as long as the property owner agrees to accept it. I learned that I can ask for a ### deferral twice. That would buy us time with respect to making s decision about which housing arrangement to choose.  I hope youâ€™re well and wonâ€™t tire of waiting for something to happen here.  Itâ€™s a comfort, knowing youâ€™re waiting in the wings. Best regards,###44050.0680555556 Hi ###,Have you made any progress with this?###44012.9256944444 Hi ###,I spoke to Grace ### yesterday and she told me that your meeting was postponed. She gave me some of the information I needed, and she was agreeable to the specific ###s I suggested. My research of the public records shows that a deed titling the house in a trust has not yet been recorded. Perhaps Mr. and Mrs. ### are waiting for the purchase of the other property to close before they do so. Grace did say that she was anticipating ### and ### moving into the house in mid to late July. She also said that they would be seeking a third roommate to make the arrangement financially feasible. I can draft a rough agreement this week, but several items remain to be detailed, including the amount of rent, the identity of the landlord, the ### (length) of the lease, and what happens at the end of the ###. For example, does it become a month-to-month te### or do the parties need to enter into a new lease?Sincerely,### Hirsh43995.6798611111 Hi ###,We have!  We had a zoom meeting yesterday afternoon and they agreed to ### paying $### rent which will include utilities.  They also agreed to everything else that you wrote into the lease agreement. We have decided to let ### stay with an AFL provider that he stayed with for ### 1/###â€™s been with most recently.  Today we spent the whole day moving ### out of his house. ### spend a week at the beach with his dad and then move into the new place. Iâ€™ll still see him regularly, if course, but this gets him out of our house while my husband undergoes radiation treatment for his prostate cancer. ### family still lives in the house that the guys will share, but theyâ€™re thinking they can be moved by the middle or end of August, which would mean a Sept move date. Tomorrow I will contact the ### Housing Authority to find out if ### can use a section ###â€™s family member owns the house.  There may be a federal restriction on that.  I just learned that late this afternoon. Iâ€™ll keep you posted.  Still some unknowns, but definitely progress. Best regards,###44012.9479166667 Hi ###,We havenâ€™t heard anything from Grace since she went on vacation. I checked in with her step-father to ask about ###, and received this reply â€œ. . . not good symptoms are worse. Also sheâ€™s mentally tired of this battle and goes without saying how physically tired she isâ€.I also checked in with the director of the autism society to ask where he stood with respect to the risk of doing this in the midst of a global pandemic.  Hereâ€™s what he said:Great to hear from you. We appear to still be stuck. As long as the state is not moving forward, we canâ€™t move forward. We currently have our similar homes with limited staff changes(working ###). Community outings are strictly dr appt and hikes. No offsite parent visits. On site visits are with social distance. It is strict and tough and not the ideal runway to start this on right foot.To that, I do understand if you want to talk to the andersons about other providers that can do this too and might have a higher risk threshold. We are still committed to getting this done, but in full transparency donâ€™t see the lane yet. Truly, you may inquire with other providers. I donâ€™t want to leave you hanging and want to be as upfront as possible.I truly would have thought by now ### be moving in a different direction as a state.### and I are pleased with the way things are currently going for ###.  He seems to be happy where he is, and he can stay there at least until the beginning of Sept.  It seems safer than a house that would require various staff to come and go.  Iâ€™m relieved that ### with Autism Society is being so cautious.  Thatâ€™s all I have to report for now. I hope you and yours are well. Best regards, ###44031.1194444444 Hi Ms. ###,I am attorney in ###, and I am willing to assist with negotiating and drafting a lease to help with ### move into a new living arrangement. Since this case will be fairly involved, I'd like to have you, and anyone else I'm representing, to sign a ### representation agreement. Although we can converse through a means that you find convenient, including my web-based client portal, telephone, or video conference, if you are agreeable I'd like to gather preliminary information from you with a a questionnaire that you would complete in Adobe Acrobat.

In short, you go through the process that your university or college has outlined, and prepare whatever arguments or evidence you wish to present during your preliminary meeting/hearing to meet the allegations against you.  Each university or college has an elaborate due process protocol in order to ensure that if a student is accused of academic dishonesty, there is a thorough vetting process by which the accuser and accused get to present their respective sides of the ### evidence--before a decision is made.  While I suppose you could bring an education law attorney with you to the hearing, I do not believe hiring legal counsel is necessary for an academic dishonesty hearing.I do not see much of a legal issue here, unless somehow the university did not afford you the due process outlined in your student handbook and academic honesty policy.  You can probably find links to these resources on the webpages of your ### of Students, Division of Student Affairs, and Division of Academic Affairs (and maybe that of your college ### as well).Best wishes to you in this highly important matter, and in your future studies.  Be well and safe.44215.9618055556 We received information from Dr. ### that an academic integrity violation may have occurred within PSYC 2150-001. Based on the information we received, you are charged with A. Cheating due to information that suggests you left the ### test-taking page ### ###. The purpose of our meeting next week is for you to have the opportunity to share your information regarding the incident, review the evidence, discuss the alleged policy violations, and ask any questions you may have about the process. You have not been found responsible for violating the Code of Student Academic Integrity at this time, it is only an allegation. The academic integrity process is in place to provide due process in order to determine an appropriate outcome. 44215.7819444444 My son is ### 7th grade. He has an IEP and has been in the EC program through CCS since K. He has dyslexia and ###. I have been asking the principal since 6th grade if ### could take another elective class other than the required PE/health class and he keeps telling me that his hands are tied, that in order for my son to take another elective class such as art or computer class he would have to miss a general ed class like social studies or science. Recently I have involved the CCS EC director through mediation and a facilitated IEP meeting.   I did get ESY services (###:###) for Pey for this summer and I requested again that ### have art as an elective for his ###st semester of 8th grade instead of PE. The principal said he would see what he could work out but Iâ€™m not convinced this will happen. This is the same man that told me ESY services were only for kids with severe brain injuries. I would like to know if my son is legally entitled to an elective classes such as art, just like any other student regardless of his situation which requires him to attend EC class while other students are in elective classes. If so, how should I approach the situation with confronting the school. There are so many questions I have...I try to be my sons best advocate and in our case, Iâ€™ve been his only advocate. I appreciate your time and response in this matter! If only I would have found this website ###.44336.9604166667 Good evening, Ms. Gupton:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  This is serious cause for concern, and I think you are on to something regarding your son's disability and need for an accommodation, even during the present pandemic.  I think this will likely require you to consult with an education law attorney, who can review your son's situation with you and determine a proper course of action--most likely, sending a letter to the school principal, and possibly the superintendent of the ### County Schools System, interpreting current federal civil rights laws as they pertain to education, as they relate to your son's rights.  While part of this is ### territory due to Covid-19, I am sure that an education law attorney can provide you some guidance on how to ensure that your son is safe and comfortable if/when he attends school in person.You can contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association, and see if they can connect you with North Carolina attorneys who practice education law; the attorneys who agree to be listed with this service are required to charge low consultation fees, so you likely would not have to pay more than $### 30-minute consultation.  You can then decide whether you want to hire counsel for the long-term (including correspondence with the school officials, to the extent counsel recommends that course), as well as whether you wish to specifically retain the attorney with which you spoke on an ### basis.In the meantime, google the U.S. Department of ### Covid-### Students and Families."  This will provide you some general information about school during the time of the pandemic (including information about how special education and children with disability issues are to be handled) although a conversation with an attorney in North Carolina is still likely needed if the school persists in not addressing your concerns.God bless you and your little boy.  I wish a healthy safe and ### summer to you and your family."44343.94375 Hi, my son is 9.  He is in the ### County School system.  He has been diagnosed with Autism, ADHD and Anxiety.

He is at risk and qualifies for in person summer school however he is unable to because he can't wear a ###.  Do I have any legal grounds for a case?Thank you in advance.44343.9159722222 I totally understand, Ms. Gupton, and have no doubt that you are a ### advocate for your son's best interest.  I applaud you and support him.You are very welcome, and it is a pleasure to engage with you on this site.  I strongly suspect the school will get in gear once they realize you have an attorney looking out for you and your family.All the best.44343.9972222222 Thank you so much for taking the time to respond so quickly!  I appreciate the advice and I will proceed with your recommendations.  I have exhausted all my options at the school level including the IEP team, superintendent, school board and EC director.  It is unfortunate that it has come to looking into the possibility of legal action.I hope you have a blessed summer!  Thank you again!God Bless You!### Gupton 44343.9569444444 Dear ###,When your move, you need to notify the current school about the address change and sometimes that requires you change schools. From your question, it looks like you moved to another town and will need to change your son's school. Let the school in Middleboro know that you are leaving and obtain a copy of his school records so that you can enroll him in Lakeville.

I am supposed to do it yesterday so as soon as someone has an answer would be Greatly Appreciated!! Thank You, ###43228.8479166667 Can a school demand that you get outpatient therapy for my child? I have an autistic child and I've been having problems in his school. They are demanding I place him in outpatient therapy and since it's taken me a little while to do so they have filed a ### with DCF claiming neglect. Although I am placing him in outpatient therapy, I want to know if it is legal for them to demand this from me. Thank you 43228.8479166667 Hi ###:Thank you for your reply and the links to information. 43228.8479166667 Ms. ###:I cannot tell from the question who specifically demanded that you place the child in therapy.  Only a treating medical professional would be qualified to recommend that a child should participate in therapy, not a teacher or a school.  As a parent, it is your decision if, when, and where your child goes to therapy.Usually an autistic child is on an Individualized Education Plan (IEP).  That plan sets out whatever tools are necessary for the child to particpate and perform well in the school environment.  The school personnel should be following the IEP when dealing with the child.This is a link to a parent's guide to special education which talks about an IEP###This is a link to information for parents about DCF###I hope this is helpful.###43228.8479166667 Here is information about when international students can qualify for in state tuition at U Mass Amherst:  ###As you can see from the website, Students on ### ### J-1 and ### tuition."If your son has some additional status besides J he may be eligible for in-state tuition.

This was helpful.###43228.8493055556 Hi, I suppose that by a trade school you mean to attend one of the vocational high schools across the state.  Vocational high schools often do have an application and admissions process and do not take everyone that applies.  As long as they apply all admissions factors/crieria evenly, without discriminating against someone for their race, sex, sexual orientation, or national origin, they can decide who to accept into the school.  If the district does not have a vocational school in their district, they usually have relationships with vocational schools in nearby towns that will consider and accept students, who are funded by the local school district.  I think this is wht the teacher explained to you- perhaps if your son did not get into the vocational school in your town you can ask the school administrators if there is any other vocational school that is close enough for him to apply.43228.8513888889 Question, can a student be refused to go to a trade.I was told by a teacher no student can be refused to go to a trade school or that city has to pay to go to a trade school in another town. she it was a little know law and it has to be persued. ### has qualified to go (attendence, grades,) theres a lottery and he was not chosen43228.8506944444 Hi my name is Dominique ### and I'm writing you regarding my daughter luvly ### she attends ### Elementary in ### Massachusetts however she doesn't go to that school she goes to the Y and I've been taking her there do to her medical treatment she needs in the morning I've been told that my child will be ###ed tardy because I do not take her to the main building so that she can get on a bus to go to the school she actually attends last year when I went to go register my child for school I was not told she will be in another building I only found out due to me going to pick her up and being told she was in a total different building my question is regarding attendance can they ### my child tardy because I do not take her to the school she doesn't go to?

We have met with someone with the public school system and have tried various ways of obtaining services through health insurance, and even though people have been wonderful at trying to accomadate our family in receiving services, our barrier seems to be with the dept of early education. Due to licensing, child has to be pulled out of daycare to receive services the correct way, or be on a waitlist to be served in a way that fits our schedule. We are on a waitlist now, but it may be as little as a year wait. Right now we have no services that the child is entitled to due to her diagnoses.But going through the 'correct' process, and as a single parent, the public school system will not fit our schedule, due to me needing to work full time to provide for my family, and even with help from social security, as it looks right now, I won't be able to provide my family with our basic needs, if I work less than full timeMy main question is, is it possible for me to bring suit to the dept of early education, for their licensing policies and how it doesn' seem to match with what families would need for a ###, in the way that the process is set up now, since I essentially run the risk of being homeless with ### ###, and also, if it is indeed our right to not choose to bring my child into the public school system to have services, but receive them elsewhere, why is it that the process only ends with the child needing to enroll in public school to actually receive said services?43228.8534722222 My school closed after I pay for the full program for medical assistant which is two semesters I only got to complete one semester before it closed and I need to seek advice on how to get loan forgiveness because I am planning on going to another school and do not want you have multiple loans.

Florida public and private schools are allowed to make their own rules regarding service dogs, support dogs and all other kinds of dogs brought onto their campus. ###.  The only possible discrimination" in this situation would be if the school was allowing people from some other race gender or national origin to bring their service dogs (if exactly like yours) onto the campus. ###.

I ### sent her screenshots of a few of the responses I got to my posts saying she was not my friend and clearly a hoarder and narcissist hen she said I should get other perspectives on the situation. I blocked her on Tuesday ###. On Saturday 10/###. By contacting the school I feel that she has now moved this matter to absolute harassment. I did not ever act in an unprofessional manner and this was personal. I signed the NCO. But then the conduct office sent me a request for a required meeting again and another non-conduct community tool". I told them I did not think her contacting the university about a personal matter was appropriate. They sent me a ### agreement to sign by Monday. I have no intention of bad ### this person. While I do want the issue to go away and they say it is not part of an official file I feel that any official documents like this could be used against me in my future residency applications. They say it won't but I don't believe them. This is the second time the conduct office has contacted me for things I feel are not appropriate. Back in ### I had to write an ### about professionalism as a non-conduct agreement because my examsoft password was Fuck###. I mean it's not the most appropriate but it's a password that I thought was private. Back in March I put in a complaint about discriminating against people with disabilities because they wouldn't allow my service dog on the bus or me in the front of the school etc. when I was at one of their campuses in ###. They took ### "did nothing wrong". It just seems like anything I sign could slowly be used to build a case against me to make me go away for them. And this friend knows I am trying to stay professional and under the radar so she did this specifically to scare me and hurt me. I go to ### University School of Medicine.

Good luck with your studies.  You have already signed the no contact" order so I don't see how the ### agreement could be harmful.  Forgive me for sounding like a parent but your medical school education is much too important to let something like this distract you.  I strongly recommend that you get on the ### Medical administration's "good side."  Your cooperation with the request should be viewed by them favorably.

My daughter is now old enough to register at his school for kindergarten. I was told at the registration that although she is out of district that considerations are made for sibling priority and hardship. I was instructed to make a transfer request and all should be fine. I then recieved a call from the school department questioning my son's absences from school from the previous year. I was told that they look at his record before determining sibling priority". When I explained he had illnesses the tone changed. I was instructed to wait the decision. I called back only to find out that they didn't have most of the excuse notes or mention of any illness being treated. Again I questioned why any of this would affect my daughter's registration. I was questioned about how my children would get to/from the school did I have my own car etc. I thought this a bid odd questioning. I explained that my son had been there ### he is a good student and well liked. His teachers all liked him and he has many friends in this school. He also sees a therapist for school anxiety.I made a seperate trip to the school and hand delivered the Doctor notes to the secretary. When I called to check the status I was told there were no notes found the secretary has no recollection of our conversation and that both children were now transferred to a local school near my address. I never authorized or requested his transfer. I explained that it would be traumatizing for my son to start a new school make new friends and take a bus (he has never taken) to an after school program which is located at an entirely different location with different kids. I'm not sure where to go with this or if there is anything else I can do to keep them together in a school where he has been. Also-never in any of these earlier conversations was "limited space" addressed. The only thing they were concerned with was his "absences". Now that I am not backing down it is "maybe no available space". Any ideas? Thank you."43308.9319444444 I have a child in ### public school who has been the recipient of bullying physical, verbally and online.

Thanks for your question. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your situation.The short answer is that you probably need a lawyer. You can contact the Massachusetts Bar Associationâ€™s Lawyer Referral Service, or the ### County Bar Associationâ€™s, or any other bar associationâ€™s:######/They can connect you with a lawyer who has relevant experience, whoâ€™s local to you, and who can sit down and talk with you for a half-hour ### free, or for a very low ### whether he or she can help you.In my opinion, Title IX investigations are very, very dangerous for people who are accused. From reading the newspaper, you probably have some idea of the problems that arise in criminal prosecutions by state agencies. All of those same problems also occur in Title IX ### a whole slew of new problems, because the investigators often arenâ€™t ###, the college may have a monetary or ### interest in resolving the dispute in a certain way, and there is zero accountability. Many of the people involved in these investigations might mean well, but itâ€™s not wrong to say that itâ€™s usually a bunch of college employees â€œplaying cops.â€ Thatâ€™s a dangerous recipe.Yes, youâ€™ll want to present your evidence to the investigator. But youâ€™ll want to be very careful about how you do it. Youâ€™ll want a professional to help you present your evidence in a way that tries to accomplish two goals: painting you in the best light possible, and ### the college into doing what they should do. (In most cases, â€œwhat they should doâ€ is turn over the matter to law enforcement immediately. Based on your description, it sounds like that would be fine with you and would lead to quick ###.)You have a lot to lose here, and the Title IX investigator isnâ€™t your friend. Thatâ€™s when you need a lawyer: because your lawyerâ€™s job is exactly that, to be your friend, to advocate for you. I suggest you contact some lawyers immediately. If you donâ€™t immediately click with the first one, donâ€™t be afraid to interview a second or third. Finding a good lawyer is like finding a good surgeon or therapist: first youâ€™ve gotta ### the bad ones, then youâ€™ve gotta find one you like. Make sure you find one you like, because this is an important process and youâ€™ll feel better if you have someone you trust helping you through it.I hope thatâ€™s helpful, ###. I know itâ€™s not the quick answer that you might have hoped ### some questions can be answered easily over the Internet, and others shouldnâ€™t be.

Legally speaking, you donâ€™t ever need to get any kind of custody order. If you and ### can work out custody and visitation issues between the two of you, then you can do that. No one will require you to go to court.However, itâ€™s always a good idea to have the custody arrangement filed with the court. â€œGoing to courtâ€ doesnâ€™t have to mean that people are arguing. Family courts would much prefer that people come to agreements on their own and ask the court to approve them, rather than asking the court to hold a hearing a listen to all the facts and make its own decision on whatâ€™s best. Those disputes consume time and usually a lot of expense. If you agree, then you can be in and out of the courtroom very quickly.If an issue comes up later, youâ€™ll be protected by a ### custody agreement.

Thanks for your question.First, let's clarify: the document you've attached is a proposed ###, not an enacted law. According to ###, that particular ### was introduced in ### (###) in ######, which died in committee. As of today, Chapter ### doesn't have any section ###.### is another matter. It's not entirely clear what the school's obligation is under ###: if you live locally, then it's ### that Boston University can fulfill its ### requirements simply by allowing you to come into the office and inspect your records, without allowing you to copy anything or giving you copies of anything. If you lived in ###, then BU would probably need to send you something to satisfy ###â€”but again, the exact obligation isn't clear and it's ### that BU could fulfill its responsibility by sending you nothing more than a webpage printout showing your grades.The short answer to your question is that colleges have broad latitude to withhold transcripts for payment defaults. The only significant loophole is bankruptcy. When you file for bankruptcy protection, an automatic stay" is placed on all your debts. Basically this is a court order barring creditors from trying to collect from you. Withholding a transcript can be seen as a collection attempt so it's typically interpreted as a violation of the ### that during the pendency of your bankruptcy petition the school can't withhold your transcripts.

My car now has damage and my school is trying to scam their way into not giving me money to fix my car damage. What legal rights do I have? I have a full police report, and video footage. If the garage was state or school property, are the liable for the safety of their students? They are trying to have me go through insurance, but as the student I am just trying to have the school issue me the money for the damage of my car. The office said the garage is state owned but doesn't the state have insurance for issues like this? As a student I feel as though I am being taken advantage of, especially when I pay 200$ a year to park in the garage. The school is responsible for their students safety. 43729.7402777778 First, with regard to the posting, if the video was only shared on Snap Chat, it is not permanently on the internet.  As you may know, Snap Chat posting are of short duration, available for viewing for ###.  That said, there are other apps that may allow Snap Chat content to be saved. The school may not have the ability to release a copy of the video for the reason it provided. You may, however, still be able to file a bullying report with Snap Chat.  Visit the Snap Chat site to learn how to report the bullying.  Also, Snap Chat may be able to advise you I the content was saved or copied.  Social Media sites are generally not legally responsible for content but do take inappropriate postings, such as bullying seriously.If bullying persists for your child or if you think the incident has not been properly handled by the school, you should consider raising this up to the the school district regarding the manner in which the school is handling bullying and your particular case. You mentioned a fight." If your child was physically assaulted you may want to report the incident to your local police to determine whether juvenile criminal charges should be pressed.  You should however consider that taking this course of action may be stressful for your son.  There may be civil recourse against the school district or even parents of the other children involved.    This would require initiating court proceedings.  Again such a case can be stressful on your son and should be considered only if you think your child has sustained injury or harm for which the school or parents should be held liable.  In the case of parents most state laws do not hold a parent liable for the act of their child unless the parent knew of the child's harmful behavior and did not take reasonable steps to control or prevent such behavior.If this is an isolated incident I recommend you not only file a bullying report with Snap Chat but keep in touch with your child's teacher and the school about preventing future incidents.  Also work with your child to let him know you are there for him keep communication open let your son know that it is not his fault that no one should be bullied and work to find ways to avoid threatening situations.

Thank you for your time43745.5993055556 Dear ###It is unfortunate that you are having to face this situation. I am not sure however that we have enough information to fully answer your question. I can tell you that the school under state law is a mandatory reporter of what they believe to be potential child abuse. Based on the apparent facts, they would need to make a decision as to whether they had triggered the reporting obligation. It appears that they believed so in this situation. With respect to the search, generally, there is legal basis for a school to search a student without parental consent under certain circumstances. That basis is very fact specific, however, and it is difficult for me to provide advice without being a party to all of the details and in this limited format. If you have concerns regarding the search, it may be in your best interest to seek advice from an attorney directly. You may be able to obtain free legal services through a number of community legal aid organizations in your area. A link to potential organizations is below.  Finally, below is a link to a Massachusetts State Website which provides information your rights as parent in working with DCF.

He was pulled from class by the school social worker to be questioned about his behavior lately. He responded that it has to do with his dads visitation. They then proceeded to ask him how he was punished at home and a ton of other things, they made him lift his clothes up and show them his body, and they called DCF. He had a scratch on his back from the shower spout, and when they asked where he got it he told them that. He is sometimes a ###, and told them things that didnâ€™t actually happen. The ### that was filed on me said he has bruising on his left hip, red marks on his arm, and a bump on the forehead. When they came and made me undress my child, they saw the scratch marks on his RIGHT hip on the back though. I showed them where he got it and how. The other marks the school said were there were not there. They did not find any abuse or neglect. I want to know my rights within the school. Is it okay for them to pull my child and question him about his behavior without notifying me? Can they search his body without my presence or consent? Or at the very least without notifying me? They didnâ€™t tell me they even wanted to talk to him, or were going to. He told me he didnâ€™t want to lift his shirt up and that he was uncomfortable all day because of it. I want to call a meeting, but I also need to be informed of my rights too. Iâ€™m a young mother, and they have always made me feel judged for that.

It was not helpful and was traumatizing to be in the same room with her.  I asked to be moved to another classroom. After two weeks of no action I was afraid to loose my job /pay and said I would go back to working with her if I didnâ€™t have to be alone with her in the classroom. The response was   â€œThe terms you are currently requesting are not consistent with the role of a teaching assistant.â€ Now, one month after the original complaint, Iâ€™ve been asked to send in a resignation letter and sign a separation agreement. It is being asked that I agree to the terms below before the letter is drafted by a lawyer ; We agree to continue to pay you an additional ###.  This amount will be $### (based on $### of regular pay x ###);You will submit a letter of resignation which will be attached to the separation agreement;You agree to a ### and confidentiality clause;You agree to release all claims against  The ### School employees, officers etc. including release of claims relating to the Massachusetts Wage Act and Age Discrimination Claims.We agree to not disclosure the circumstances of your resignation to prospective employers unless you agree to do so. We will only release details about your position and dates of employment.I donâ€™t agree with anything in the â€œ separation agreement â€œ and feel the whole affair was wrongly handled and unethical. And I donâ€™t believe the teacher was even investigated.What are my legal rights? How can I be effective in changing the model and responsibilities the school has towards itâ€™s employees?Thank you so much,###43826.6131944444 Please respond 43836.6270833333 On Monday, ### my ###, he is ### 2018.

He first went after her friend ### and grabbing her. He then started jacking his pants up and trying not before her to fight. Then my friends daughter tried to get her friend away from the situation. He then threaten her life. He said I'm kill you" she maced him. Statement were taken and my friends daughter has been back to school sense. Today we got a phone call saying she's being charged for adult with a weapon. The student handbook list guns knives chains ECT ad weapons. It doesn't state mace. Everything we see for NC schools show that Mace is allowed unless the student handbook states other wise. How is she being charged and the boys getting nothing. It was self defense. And what can we do about it. "44516.9152777778 Dear Ms. ###: So sorry to hear about this.  Your friend's child should talk to her criminal defense attorney. If she has been charged this is a criminal matter, and the best person to defend her will be her attorney.  Your friend can make sure the attorney knows about what the handbook says.  Good luck to her on the court date. 44518.8854166667 Dear Ms. ### ###,I have a few questions about your case before I determine what your next steps should be - I am dividing the set of questions into FACT questions and LEGAL questions.  The fact questions are to learn more about what actually happened in your case and the legal questions are to determine what laws and regulations apply to your current situation.FACT QUESTIONS###) Is your daughter currently living with you?###) Did your daughter miss ### ###?  When did your daughter last miss school (since school was open)?###) Did you provide doctor's notes to the school for the times that your daughter had to miss school because of her health condition?###) When you asked for help from the school, did you ask for help in writing?  Did you ask if your daughter could receive homeschool or a modified schedule due to her health condition?   LEGAL QUESTIONS###) Did the DCF decision use one of the following terms: supported, unsupported, or substantiated?###) Have you ever been involved with Probate and Family Court proceedings related to any of your children?  ###) Did you already submit an appeal to DCF and if so, did you ask for a Fair Hearing request?  I look forward to hearing back from you and answering your question as best as I can.  Sincerely,Paola ###, Esq.43941.1284722222 Dear Ms. ### ###,I just wanted to check in and see if you were still interested in discussing more about your legal question above.  If you cannot answer all the questions, then do not worry, just answer what you can and I will see what I can do to direct you to some answers.Stay safe and healthy,Paola43950.8652777778 Hi, i would like to know what can i do about the school calling DCF on me after my daughter missed ###. What i got was DCF called on me. I dont have a court day, but i am appealing the DCF decision. Please help me. I have ### ###.43935.4131944444 ###,I understand that your friend already had his meeting with Residence Life on ###rd.  Please feel free to respond with an update if the meeting did not go well for your friend.  I am also assuming that your friend is living in university dorms (and not, for instance, in off-campus housing).To your question, the recent law more specifically placed a moratorium on eviction proceedings, whereby all eviction procedures are paused, and landlords cannot initiate any new eviction proceedings or even serve any eviction notices to tenants, such Notices to Quit.  This moratorium will last until ###, or ###-###, whichever comes first.  Since removing students from university housing does not require an eviction process, I do not see this new law impacting the ability of colleges and universities to remove students from dorms.  I would suggest reviewing the school's student handbook as it relates to housing.43949.6805555556 I am aware that Boston has a curfew recommendation for ###. My friend left his dorm at ###, every time he leaves he has to give his name to check out of the building. However, this morning he received a message that he violated the school's residence life rules and has a meeting later today. Regarding the current COVID-###, which protects people from losing their housing during the COVID-###. Would it be illegal for university housing to evict the student in the above scenario? 43944.6333333333 Can you please tell me what the Statue of Limitations  is regarding physical abuse on a special needs kid in a school for kids with issues.  My sonâ€™s toe was broken by a staff member about ###.  ###. i am only asking a question regarding the Statue of Limitations so i know whether or not we are able to file a case against the staff/school.   He did not understand the when he was younger what he could or could not do. He was about ### ###. i asked him then if he wanted to sue but he was so angry.  He has special needs but he is higher functioning.  I am hoping that the law has an extension on the Statue against the offender if the victim has special needs.  He feels he is older and understands a little better and wants to sue now.  He was in a residential program.  We have all records regarding the case.  Is it too late to pursue a suit against them?  We had went to court at the time because they feared being sued and tried turning the case on my son because he threw a phone so they had him arrested and then dropped the charges in an attempt to press us not to sue but we never signed anything saying we would not sue. He was bruised and had teeth marks on his back.  His neck was all bruised.  We have pictures.43978.6194444444 Hello-- questions for clarification: are you the guardian for your son? What was the circumstance at the time of the incidents?when you say we had went to court at the time does that mean you (or he) filed suit about one or both of these incidents? ###43979.8090277778 I did not file to be his legal guardian because he was very difficult and always arguing with me but he really  did need a guardian.  He is not in his right mind. He just thinks he is.At the time of the incident when he was bitten, i was going to take him home that day for good.  He was so frustrated because he was so abused by them that he threw the phone after hanging up with me.  It hit the staff member in the forehead.  He was not seriously hurt.  I am not making excuses for him; however; this was a school for behavior problems.  After the phone hit the staff, the staff attacked and bit my son leaving marks on his back.  i took pictures and called the police.  They knew they were in trouble.  The police in the area have a very good relationship with the school because there are always incidents with behavior problems.  When we got home, they sent us a summons in the mail for my sonâ€™s arrest as a way to threaten us not to file a lawsuit.  We went to court.  They dropped the lawsuit but told us that they were dropping it and we felt threatened not to sue because we feared they would arrest him again.  So we reluctantly agreed but we never signed papers that we would not.  My son was so angry, he is traumatized until today because of it.  I asked him if he wanted to sue later but he was so angry, he would yell and scream and i could bot talk to him about it.  He ### not understand he could not sue later.  He just wanted to kill him for the abuse.  Finally now yrs later, he understands the only way to get justice is to sue.  There were other kids that were abused there as week according to my son but they were so afraid to say anything because they were living there and did not know what would happen to them.  Regarding the time the staff broke his toe, the staff would taunt him ### other students by ### then for behavior ls unnecessary.  My son got angry and kicked a plastic desk.  They decided they were going to restrain him.  The staff, ### ### said what is he in for.  Then he ok i got his foot.  He reached for his ### toe, wiggled it and pulled it back.  He went to hospital and DCF was also called.  The DCF worker said the break is not consistent with someone just accidentally breaking their toe.  The hospital also has records of it.  But the DCF didnâ€™t file a case against then because they said my sob lied about kicking the desk but he was afraid, aline and young.  I did not know at the time that I could appeal the DCF findings.  I had no idea.  The school tried to make it look like it was my sonâ€™s fault that the toe broke but it really was nit consistent with a natural break.  The toe was pulled ###.  If there is anyway we can get justice, we would really appreciate it.  Until this day my son has very serious issues regarding this case.  i feel that because his mind wasnâ€™t right he should be able to sue the school and or the offenders directly.  They have gotten away with this and he is ready to move forward against them.  He was angry and afraid and was not capable of understanding his rights then.  Now a little older, he understands more.  Everything is on record, be it the court system and hospital and there are picture of bite marks and serious bruising around neck ### chest area from being attacked.43980.5881944444 Sorry for the confusion. I was trying to say, normally the limitations statute would be ###. But if he was mentally disabled at the time and remains mentally disabled, the statute would be extended for him as long as he remains disabled.To get additional legal help with your problem, you can try one of the following:www.masslrf.org:  use this search to get contact information for free and low cost sources of civil legal help, and links to legal informationIf you need to hire a lawyer, you can use one of the lawyer referral services on this list.

Also, you responded saying something about after the disability is removed.  I do not understand that either.  He is older and understands a little better now.  Exactly how long would he have to file? How would i find an atty to accept the case?  I asked ###  he said the statue ran out.    i am still a bit confused.43983.8708333333 Thank you. I thought they would take the fee once the lawsuit is completed from any money won in the lawsuit.43983.9326388889 Thanks for the additional information. Normally the statute of limitations for personal injury in Massachusetts is three years for people who are adults at the time of injury Ch. ###, section ###. However, if your son is indeed mentally incapacitated, he may be able to bring an action against the school and/or employees involved under the operation of the tolling statute Ch. ###, section 7, which states that If the person entitled thereto is a minor or is incapacitated by reason of mental illness when a right to bring an action first accrues the action may be commenced within the time hereinbefore limited after the disability is removed."  This extension of time to file suit has been upheld by the Massachusetts Supreme Court (see ### v. MBTA ### ### (###). Hope that helps. Good luck to you."43983.7756944444 That is how most personal injury lawsuits work, but not all. It will depend on what lawyer you work with. I wish you luck. Be well. ###43984.00625 ###,From the facts that you described, this seems like something that we should be able to resolve - and I would think that ### would want to help you to finish.  Generally speaking, private colleges have the right to set their own rules as long as they are disclosed to you up front and as long as the rules don't violate the law. I have not checked, but I would assume that the limitation on semesters is probably included in some code of conduct or academic expectations document (though you'll want to verify).  Where you probably want to focus is compliance with the law.I am not an expert in school law, but generally speaking, the school cannot discriminate against you because of a medical disability and would be required to make reasonable accommodations for you.  Ideally, we will want to get your doctor to write a letter outlining the reason for each of your ###, the medical diagnoses and treatments you received for each of these ###, and the manner in which the College can accommodate your condition by allowing additional semesters. It seems surprising to me that the College is taking such a hardline position.  Can you submit to me (through this site) a copy of any communications you've had with the College on this issue?  It would also help to know where the College is coming from.  Have you had any disciplinary action against you that could be ### their views?Once I have that information, I can help you put together a letter laying out your position and appealing their decision.Thanks in advance.44029.7270833333 I tried to return to my college (### College) this week after taking time off for mental health issues. I found out I cannot register for courses because I have taken too many semesters. The reason I have too many semesters is that I took incompletes in my classes on two separate occasions, but was unable to finish them for mental health reasons. No one ever informed me that each semester of incompletes would remove one semester I could remain at the college, regardless of completion. I am now finding out that I should have taken a leave of absence instead. For the first semester in which I took incompletes, ### has closed them permanently, and I no longer even have the ability to finish them. For the second semester of incompletes, I should have taken a medical leave. This past spring, I was hospitalized for mental health reasons. After about two months, I went to stay with my parents in ###, and I did an intensive outpatient program daily for about six weeks. Now, I am still in ###, and I am in a different intensive outpatient program that I attend twice a week. I receive ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) the other three days a week. The ECT is helping very much, so I reached out to ### to return in the fall. Resuming my studies now would work two-fold because ### is offering the courses I need online (due to the Coronavirus). Typically, these courses would not be online, and I would therefore not have the added benefit of completing my last semester with the support of my parents and current outpatient program. However, ### will not let me return as a student because I am over the number of semesters the college initially allotted me. In addition to mental health issues, I also have lifelong learning disabilities for which I receive extra time accommodations. As part of these accommodations, I am supposed to be allowed to take three courses a semester instead of four. This alone should have entitled me to extra semesters. I had a ### evaluation done in 2016, after which ### Academic Review Board met and agreed to grant me an additional semester or two to fulfill this accommodation.Is there anything I can do? I don't understand how this is legal.  I hate to cause trouble for ### because some truly wonderful people have worked with me there, but this feels like discrimination.  I am incredibly frustrated and have already lost hours of my day trying to figure this out, and I only got the news seven hours ago.  I am unsure of what to do or where to turn. Can you help me? 44023.1722222222 Hi, my name is ### Blackmoon, I have been a student at ### Community College since ###015. This semester has been particularly difficult. I have been mistreated by multiple faculty members at the institution and I do not feel capable of resolving these issues on my own. Please read the details below to get a picture of what I am trying to navigate. I have become a victim of clique ###. A ### who initially supported me in a conflict I was trying to resolve with his staff, is now joining with that professor in filing a report against me. I am being accused of harassment and intimidation, which I am not guilty of. I filed an appeal to request a refund for this class because the professor is not competent. Her supervisor agreed with my concerns and said he supported and would advocate for me on the appeal, but now he is also listed on the report against me for the above allegations. On top of that, another professor in a different department has discriminated against me because of my learning disabilities. I reached out to her for clarification about the course instructions and to address my struggles to meet the deadlines for assignments. This professor was hostile in her tone during a phone call and insulted me because I didn't understand her instructions and that it takes me longer to read than everyone else. Afterwards I reached out to her supervisor for support, who dismissed my complaint and indirectly sided with her staff stating that she doesn't hire people who she doesn't believe to be ### sound. The fact is, that professor yelled at me on the phone, and is seemingly not being disregarded for. I fear being expelled and loosing my loan money, which is my only income aside from unemployment, that is worst case scenario. And ###, I fear the that the allegations being put on me will stain my transcript and ruin my reputation as well as my chances to get into a better school to continue my education.   I am a good student. Despite my learning disabilities, I have earned a ###.###. I care about my education and am driven to accomplish my goals to earn my PHD some day. I have been trying with all my might to get through this semester and reach out for help when an issue comes up, but as I do so, things get worse and are now completely out of line. I am a straight ###, honest and often dry. But by no means am I a threatening person. Please read through all of this and let me know what you think. I would like to have an out of school advocate with will not let these people continue to threaten me just because I have advocated for myself and my right to have a good education. Thank you for your time,### Blackmoon44120.7215277778  I was formerly a resident at the ### academy in Freetown MA. Iâ€™ve been home now on Long ### NY for about a year and a half. I am currently ### ###. While a resident at ### there was a staff member working there his name was ### ###. His position was a staff member.  Since I left ### ### has moved on from there. The question I have is. I know employees of residential schools need to sign a confidentiality clause in order to be employed there, but for some reason ### no longer working at ### decided to call my employer and tell my employer that I was â€œ a pedophile and mentally unstableâ€ this is not true. According to Massachusetts law is there anything that I can do so this will not happen again. Does the confidentiality clause follow employees after they leave or are terminated. The job I was working had a potential to earn 75,###. And now due to this phone call I am unemployed.44145.9263888889 I am a survivor of sexual violence and intimate partner abuse, and I am including a summary of my legal needs, and a detailed account of the abuse I suffered. I am sending this information to your office to request you consider this case for a potential civil suit against the school I attended, ### Boston, and for your consultation regarding defamation risks if I share this information with a media ###. While I engaged with multiple systems through this harrowing experience (which I outline in my detailed summary) - my focus is currently on exploring potential legal action against the school. Here are a few bullet points that highlight my legal concerns: ### Boston claims that because I was no longer a student at the time of the assault, they cannot take any action. While this is true that I was not a student at the time of the sexual assault, the perpetrator is a professor. I met him because he was my professor, and he began to send me suggestive messages while he was my professor.I believe that ### Boston discriminated against me for being from ###, and being so new to US culture.I am from ###, and had begun taking classes at ### Boston very shortly after arriving in the US. I soon discovered that there were significant cultural differences, and the professor was aware of this, and took advantage of this.The terms sexual violence, assault, and rape have significant and specific cultural signifance to me, and I did not understand how the US defines these terms. This resulted in some inconsistencies early on in reporting. Once I understood the terms, it was clear to me that I experienced sexual assault. The school did not allow time to explain these terms to me.Additionally, I believe that ### Boston inappropriately took certain actions without going through appropriate procedures, and with inaccurate information. For example, they helped the perpetrator obtain an ### against me (the order was not issued). They issued a no trespass order preventing me from returning to campus, and finally, based on false information, they sent the police to my apartment for a wellness check (which served to ### and intimidate me, Boston municipal court told me it was even a criminal one).This is a short summary of what I have been through. Please find included a more detailed account. I would be very grateful if you can look through this, and if you would be able to speak with me for a consultation. 44182.5395833333 Live in ###, MA, no cases pending, no prior issues. My son attends small private (###) school, technically registered with school board as a homeschooler. School is not meeting all my sons needs, and am concerned for his well being. I want to withdraw. The teacher has a false belief that he is in a dire situation because of  untrue things my son said that sound like we are negligent and abusive. Teacher feels our son is developmentally delayed, he has no formal diagnosis, and no one agrees. she is not a medical professional and has formed a really biased and exaggerated opinion of our home life which is not accurate. She's reporting us under false pretenses and is trying to disallow the state to give us permission to homeschool. We want to leave because we feel his needs are not being met and there are some safety concerns with supervision, and she is slightly emotional unstable and being ###. She is believing the exaggerated words of a seven year old and has never personally addressed these issues with us. We have lots of evidence and proof that we are attentive parents, what do I do if someone reports us and how do I navigate this? Whenever I have brought up my concerns she responds with heated emails about how off base I am but have never addressed the few core issues we feel are not being met with out son. We just want to peacefully withdraw, and we want to prevent her from contacting the state and the school board and reporting her misleading notes in her files. She's very controlling and has personally insulted me several times. What are my options to continue to homeschool my son legally and how do I keep this from progressing into an investigation or any of my parenting rights being taken from me?Thank you.44202.05 Is it legal in Massachusetts for an English professor in college to teach about ###?

There are no state laws in Massachusetts that direct or restrict the course content for community college courses. 44238.9236111111 Hi ###,Iâ€™m truly sorry that youâ€™re dealing with the situation with your son's school.Whether your son has behavioral challenges, emotional challenges, a substance problem, or a disability, heâ€™s entitled to a thoughtful, comprehensive, and appropriate education that will facilitate a bright future for him. I would strongly advise you to find an experienced educational attorney ### advocate for your sonâ€™s educational and civil rights and help you secure a private, out-of-district placement. There are several ways you could potentially fix this issue without litigation, but you need an expert to inform you about your son's rights and about his individual needs. Most importantly, I can tell you that if the school district has an attorney, you may want the same protection and leverage.If you decide that you donâ€™t want ### representation, an education lawyer can also advise behind the scenes and give you the knowledge you need to advocate for your son.The best referrals are always through family and friends.

Here is a link for your reference https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/title-ix-updates-part-2-informal-45496/44048.1118055556 Do you have any possible suggestions on how I could pose a request to â€œmediateâ€ the situation with school again? Originally they said no, but I donâ€™t want to turn this into a situation of I am going to report both women because they were unaware of what I have an understanding of 44032.6895833333 I actually do have some of this in writing! They wonâ€™t give me a sit down meeting with these two, but I do have it in an email about if they are there first then I should go, and versa. It is a MUTUAL order of no contact if that helps 44032.6784722222 I ink you have done all that you can do right now.  This area of the law is not well settled and leaves a lot to each school to decide how to best handle situations. 44032.6881944444 Please let me know if there is something more specific I should be asking 44029.8069444444 Thank you so much again! Since this NCO applies throughout the year, would it be within reason to ask for some more guarantees once the policy is official? As of right now the arrangement is not equitable (the definition for contact for the complaints is not the same definition is have as a respondent), and would like to avoid this so I can avoid not being harassed 44049.0923611111 The new regulations give you some mandatory due process rights. I do not know if they will be applied retroactively. You will need to see what the school does to revise its policies with respect to these new regulations.With respect to your question about defining contact" - courts typically use the dictionary definition if not otherwise defined in a governing policy or notification."44048.63125 This is a pretty grey area of the law.  Under Title IX, you have some due process rights, but I do not see that they are implicated yet with the scenario you pose. There is no law that says you must leave the place if these women show up. The risk is that they will report you again and the school may see that as a violation of the no contact order. My suggestion is that you send a written request to the Title IX coordinator at your school, ask him/her to provide specific directives in writing to you as to what you are supposed to do in this situation and ask that they be provided equally to the two women.  I have also seen situations where all of the parties mediate" the dispute with the Title IX coordinator and come to an agreement - such that if you are there first you don't have to leave but they do in order to avoid any problems and visa versa. "44032.675 To keep it simple, can I have a quick summary of what some of my rights may be under an informal resolution44049.0972222222 about a month I received a notice from my school about a INFORMAL order of no contact (nothing on file officially). The letter states that I am not to have contact with these two women, and they are not to have contact with me. It is filed under title ###/stalking- nothing of sexual nature was involved. Part of the complaint was that I did not respect boundaries of i do not want to talk to you anymore" but I dont feel I ever got the clear "NO" that was CONSISTENT with their typical behavior (they're both kind of crazy). I have no issue not talking to them I can avoid looking at them etc. The letter the school gave me is relatively vague it states I am to no longer contact these individuals why its good and how long and schools title ###. I have been trying to get clear concrete answers from school I get different answers from different administrators (there were three dealing with this) I am told to ask counseling and counseling advocates that I try to ask school. NO one is giving me an answer and I am expected to "use my own Judgement".While I do not like this situation as I stated before I can handle it by not talking to individuals. The problem is- we have the same friend group. The school has told me that I am able to share with everyone what has happened as long as I dont suggest imply tell them to "go do this for me now". I don't want to do anything like that I want to move on. My biggest question I want answered: In one scenario the school has answered in different ways is the idea of us both being out in public in the same area. At one time I got answer of I do not necessarily have to leave any place as long as I dont contact them while I have also heard that I am "advised (ie you should do this)" to leave if they are present. This is supposed to be a two way agreement but I do not think that the school is treating this as such. Legally with this no contact order am I REQUIRED to leave if I end up being in the same place as them or vice versa. I understand that if I do engage with them directly or indirectly this can be seen as as a problem but I want to know if I can be reported for just being present without engaging either party. "44029.6972222222 ###,I am not familiar with the new Title IX regulations, which can be found here, so I cannot speak to whether or not the school's determination is in line with the new regulations.  If you feel that the school has not complied with applicable regulations, you can either bring your concerns to the school directly or engage a local attorney who handles these types of matters to assist you.  I have seen recommendations from experts in the field suggesting that schools adopt an adopted Title IX policy prior to the effective date of the new regs.  Whether or not your school has done so, I do not know but that is something you could inquire about and request a copy of the current applicable policy if it is not encompassed within the school's handbook.  Good luck.44060.6416666667 I actually read something very similar to that! The office of Civil Rights (###) guided me directly through the outline here https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/###/docs/titleix-regs-unofficial.pdf. It is a GIANT pdf. The school informed me that because the resolution was resolved BEFORE the official date these regulations took effect (###), they dont apply to my situation, even though the mutual no communication order lasts longer than that. Even looking at the old rules and our student handbook from last year, it says that any allegations of sexual harrassment need to follow the title ###, only the title ###. They are telling me now because it was an informal resulution it doesn't fall under title 9? Right now the informal resolution is definitely not equitable: She wrote me in a letter if I am somewhere first and the complaint attempts to talk to me, I need to leave without taking any action. 44060.6472222222 I assume you are describing a situation where the school had two students agree to a mutual no contact order.  If this is the case, typically the no contact order will contain language regarding what happens if one or both students violate the order, or it will reference the student conduct policy or manual which describes the consequences.As with any violation of school policy, the penalty for violating the order will depend upon the nature and severity of the violation, the terms of the no contact order and the school's policies.  Typically, first-time violations of mutual No Contact Orders typically would not result in separation (suspension or expulsion) unless the violation was egregious or there was a history of prior violations of University policy that warranted such action.Notifying the school administrator who signed the no contact order of a technical violation is always a good idea.  Particularly if you don't know how the other party interpreted the contact.  This gives you an opportunity to describe the circumstances to the administrator without feeling like you are defending yourself.If after reviewing the terms of the no contact order you still do not understand what the consequences, if any, would or will be in this instance, I would encourage you to schedule an appointment with the school administrator assigned to the matter to ask him/her to help you understand what should be done.I hope this is helpful to you.best regards,###44050.7125 In the Federal Register, Volume 85, No. ### (dated ###), page ###, The Department understands ###â€™ desire to require recipients who have previously conductedgrievance processes in a way that the ### view as unfair to reopen the determinations reached under such processes. However the Department will not enforce these final regulations retroactively."As a result it appears that you will have to resolve your matter under the practices and policies that were in effect prior to the new regulations becoming effective.  What constitutes an "informal resolution" versus some more formal level of resolution would be governed by those practices and policies. You certainly can ask the school why your matter is only an 'informal resolution' and not something more formal or you can engage an attorney with expertise in this area of law (which I am not) to assist you in determing your options and what is the most appropriate course of action for your situation.   Good luck with your situation. "44060.6625 Thank you so much ###! I just have one question left. What are my rights as a respondent with the new title ### ###th? I did talk to the administrator, and after I explained what happened she sent me a letter saying I wonâ€™t be punished this time, but then gave me stricter rules I do not believe the other party has to follow, even though they initiated contact. 44050.9979166667 Update: the school says since this is an informal resolution, it is somehow not filed under title 9, even though the complaint stems to a title ### (harassmentâ€”stalking). They never pursued specifics, but I feel that they have enough info to determine it is harassment/stalking. How can they say that it is now not under the juristiction of the title ### ### 44060.0013888889 What if both parties in a mutual no contact order from school violated said agreement? I informed my school the situation as soon as I could, but I am wondering if we would all be at fault? 44038.2368055556 Bernardo, Just the fact that you've done so much by giving me your time and attention on here is more than helpful enough. Unfortunately, I have found out that I am not the first, but I hope to be the last. No one has ever gone against them. It's been very time consuming and costly. I'm out of expendable finances, but I'm not going to stop. The attorney I originally retained told me I didn't have a case other than they slow ### my appeal process. However, after doing endless hours of research on these things I've found so many violations. I recently found that I was supposed to/entitled to a new appeals panel as well. Since this initial appeals panel could not offer me a fair and unbiased decision. They had already found me guilty" and finalized the dismissal. I found in my records that they said I was too calm and organized and that made me narcissistic. On top of that they said that I wasn't appealing this for educational purposes but rather because I wanted to be manipulative and retaliate.That same panel were the deciding panel on the second appeal. "For example in ### v. ### (###) a New York court vacated the expulsion of a student at a state university because one individual had served on both his hearing and appeals panels. The court concluded logically that someone who already had voted to find the student responsible at a hearing clearly had formed an opinion on the charge before serving on the appellate panel. In this case such a denial of due ### also violated the universityâ€™s own proceduresâ€”cast a shadow on the universityâ€™s entire disciplinary process. As a result the court overturned the rulings of both the original and the appellate panels." This gave me something more to fight. To add a ### on top in my discovery documents the director who started all of this actually started calling/emailing/texting staff and students AFTER the dismissal on ### in order to collect "anything else ### may have said." The panel used that "evidence" as more reason to uphold the dismissal. Gosh I wish I could just upload everything and have you look through it. It is mind blowing and down right depressing to see what institutions say behind closed doors when they think no one will ever see it. I'm going to attempt to reach out to another attorney and take out a loan in order to retain him. Thank you so much for everything! You're work is so truly appreciated. -### "44060.8319444444 Bernardo, last question!!Would it be better to hire a different lawyer before I fire the One I hired for this? Or fire him first then find another? The one I hired when this started handled it all so wrong and wont work with me. Iâ€™m just not getting anywhere with him. Thank you, ###44068.475 Bernardo,Iâ€™ve finally received some information on my case situation. In ###/harassment complaint against the nursing director at OTC . The complaint was made to the ### of Allied Health (her boss). Is it legal that not only did I get ignored initially by the ###, she instead forwarded my email to the respondent with a â€œFYIâ€ note attached. The respondent said it was boldfaced lies to which the ### responded with â€œI can read between the lines of her email. No need to worry. I have more pressing issues on my to-do list. Haha!â€ First, is it legal for her to have shared my email with the respondent without contacting me or doing any formal investigation? Or without contacting someone to investigate the claims?Secondly, I feel as though all this did was put a larger target on my back for continued bullying and harassment. Lastly, would it not have been prudent for her to excuse herself from any future meetings/committee decisions on my behalf with her initial attitude towards me? I stood no chance when I was dismissed by her from the jump. I had never met the woman before not spoken with her. Yet this was her reaction to such a serious offense by staff. thanks so much for your time. -###44058.0875 Dear Ms. ###, My name is Bernardo and I will try to answer your question to the best of my knowledge, and to give you a brief overview of your rights as a student enrolled in a public institution. Historically, public universities and colleges have had free reign to do as they pleased. They used to have total control over their students, free from external involvement. That all changed in ###, when the court in ### v. ### State Board of Education decided to intercede in the internal affairs of public postsecondary institutions. ### is a landmark case which held that the students in public colleges and universities have constitutional rights to due process and equal protection whenever the collegeâ€™s state action threatens to injure the student with expulsion or suspension. Specifically, ### ruled that public colleges and universities must provide accused students with (a) notice of the charges; (b) the names of witnesses against him/her; (c) a written report of all witnessesâ€™ testimony; (d) the opportunity to question the evidence; and (e) a written notification of the outcome. Despite having been decided almost ###, ### is still the standard for due process regarding students under procedural due process. While ### is still a landmark case that provided students the rights to due process, it was not until ### v. Central Missouri State College (###), that the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals provided a ruling on procedural due process with greater detail as to standards to be observed by public colleges and universities. Below is a list of all due process protections a student is entitled to: a written statement of the charges, provided to each student at least ###; a hearing before the person having the power to expel or suspend; the opportunity to view statements to be submitted at the hearing; the right to bring counsel to the hearing in an advisory capacity only; the opportunity to provide their own witnesses and version of the facts; the right to hear the testimony against them and the right to question witnesses directly; a decision based solely upon the facts and evidence presented during the hearing; a written statement of the boardâ€™s findings; and the right to make a record of the hearing at their own expense. Now that I have explained your constitutional rights under the procedural due process clause of the US Constitution, I will answer your question directly. In summary, your only option is to sue ### Technical Community College. First, I would hire an attorney. I understand that this may be an issue cost-wise, but there are resources out there (Missouri Legal Aid, for example, and other non-governmental organizations that fight for individualsâ€™ constitutional rights). The attorney will be especially important in notifying ### Technical about your intention to file suit. This alone may prompt them to review your dismissal and respect your constitutional right to due process. If the notification does not work, then your attorney will file a lawsuit and you will resolve this in court. Does this answer your question? Kind regards,Bernardo44050.8534722222 Hi ###, I apologize for not responding to your earlier message. Last week as a ### and this somehow slipped through the cracks.Responding to your question, if you had already filed a lawsuit against OTC, I would recommend hiring a new lawyer before firing your current one. You do not ever want to be involved in a lawsuit without an attorney representing youâ€”this prevents the opposing party from doing any unwarranted shenanigans. Because you have yet to file a lawsuit, I do not think it matters that much.That said, I would shop around for a replacement lawyer prior to firing your new one. You want to make sure that whatever lawyer you choose will be willing and able to take on your case immediately. Be upfront when you do this, explain you currently have a lawyer whom you do not fully trust to handle this issue, and that you are looking for a better alternative.Once you have come to terms with a new lawyer, you can send your current attorney an email/registered mail letting him/her go. You do not need to fully explain yourself, but you should expand a little bit on why you are letting him/her go (confirm this with your new attorney, however, as he will know better once you tell him the story). Because there is no lawsuit yet, I do not think your current lawyer will have any claim against your case. The following website provides some information on how to best fire your attorney: https://cochranfirm.com/when-and-how-do-i-fire-my-lawyer/https://www.rocketlawyer.com/article/firing-your-lawyer.rl I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to ask as many questions you want ðŸ˜Š Best,Bernardo44068.5756944444 Hi ###, I hope this message finds you well. Before I even analyze the additional information you provided me, I will respond to your questions. ###â€™ conduct seems to be very amateurish and inappropriate. I am not sure if the ###â€™s conduct of sharing your information is illegal, but it is definitely improper given the circumstances. That would be one more issue to be included in your lawsuit against them. Likewise, her participation in your dismissal process after showing a blatant disregard for your bullying/harassment complaint is highly inappropriate. I believe both of these facts further support a potential lawsuit against ###. That said, will you walk me over the facts again? As I understand it, you filed this complaint against the nursing director in 2018. Instead of investigating and following up with you, the ### instead forwarded your email to the nursing director and never got back to you on the complaint. Essentially, she ignored your complaint and fully believed the nursing ### assertion that â€œthis is full of boldfaced lies.â€ The next piece of information I have is that you were dismissed for â€œdisciplinary issuesâ€. Whatâ€™s the bridge between these two events? Are they dismissing you because you allegedly lied in your bullying/harassment complaint? Or did this specific nursing director graded your poorly and asked for your dismissal? I think it would help me a lot (and help your future attorney) if you could prepare a timeline of events, and make a list of all the documents you have concerning not only your dismissal, but also any instances where you communicated with the nursing director, and examples of her bullying/harassment. On a different note, I still think you should retain an attorney. Many attorneys will work on a contingency basis (after analyzing your story/case and concluding that it is a viable case, that is), and will take on your case free of costs, with payment after you win it. Best,Bernardo44058.7784722222 Hi ###, Thank you for providing a detailed account of what has happened to you. I believe putting it on paper like that serves many purposes other than informing me/your future attorney of the ongoing issues. First: I am really sorry about this whole ordeal. It is mind blowing that OTC has treated you not only unfairly but extremely ###. Their lack of professionalism, allied with their total disregard for their own regulations, makes me think you were neither the first nor the last student to be treated this way. I applaud you for standing up for your rights; I am fully aware of how challenging it is to do so. At this point, I suspect you do not even want to return to OTC; correct? Nevertheless, you should still file a lawsuit to obtain damages, seek reimbursement for your tuition, and whatever other relief your future attorney suggests. Unfortunately, I am not close to ### County, so I cannot take your case on a pro bono basis. That, however, should not deter you from retaining a local attorney (or seeking other pro bono services, which I will explain below). It is my duty to inform you that you could potentially file this lawsuit on your own. Individuals have the right to represent themselves in court and file a lawsuit without an attorney. In fact, that is very customary in small claims court. However, I would advise against doing so in this instance. This will be a pretty fact/witness heavy case, and I believe an attorney will be able to properly assist you as you navigate murky litigation ###. The links below are for the Legal Services of Southern Missouri, which offers pro bono representation in your area, and a list of discounted & pro bono services that may also be available in your area. I am not sure if the Legal Services of Southern Missouri accepts cases such as yours, but it is worth reaching out to them anyway. https://www.lsosm.org/ ###/ Because I do not know if you qualify for any of the services in the links above, I am also providing you with the link for the lawyer search feature of the Missouri Bar website (###). This feature allows you to search for education law attorneys who practice in your county. There is a dropdown box on the Lawyer Search page under Choose Area of Practice" where you can select the area of law that you wish to search for. There are a handful of attorneys in Missouri that have registered through Lawyer Search indicating they offer representation for family law matters. You may also conduct your own research on this issue (google works too!). I note that many attorneys offer services on a contingency basis. This means they will represent you for free and will request a share of your earnings to the extent you are successful. To do so they will usually schedule a free consultation and then they will conduct an analysis of your case. If they believe you have a shot at winning they will take your case essentially for free or at least with minimum costs to you. If you choose to file this motion pro se (without an attorney) I suggest you reach out to the Circuit Clerk at the ### County courthouse. The clerkâ€™s information can be found on the link below: http://courts.###countymo.gov/circlerk.html Every courthouse has its own set of rules for pro se litigants and I believe the circuit clerk is in prime position to inform you of those rules and any other requirements/forms that may be applicable. That said I again emphasize that this is a complicated case and you would benefit greatly from retaining an attorney. Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions and I will do my absolute best to answer them. I apologize for not being able to represent you myself. BestBernardo"44060.7590277778 I actually did file with my current attorney, so itâ€™s good to know that I should stay covered and hire a new one before letting my current one go. My current attorney told me I donâ€™t really have much of a case and that I wonâ€™t be able to file the claim I believe I have. Hence, thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t want to continue to retain him. I have paid him hourly upfront as to not owe him anything after. Iâ€™ll look into it more and talk it through with a future attorney. Thank you so much! 44068.6291666667 I was actually an ### and ### tutor for OTC after getting my Associates degree from there obtaining a ### along with a clean record with no disciplinary concerns at any point.In ###. By December I had been targeted multiple times by the director. I sent an email outlining my concerns to the ### of Allied Health. As you can see, my concerns were not taken seriously nor did I ever stand a chance to fair treatment. In January of ###, per my request, a meeting was held with the Director, ### of Allied ###, ### of Students, and an instructor who I asked to attend the meeting on my behalf as a witness (let me state that this instructor has been retaliated against and treated poorly for defending me). No investigation into my claims was ever conducted by OTC, only the meeting that was held for me to express my concerns. No students were questions, not records investigated, nothing. ### I was placed on a clinical contract" for "poor behavior". They said that because I got upset during a ### lab for "killing" my patient due to no understanding what I was to do that I was unprofessional. Instead of ### me through and helping me understand how to approach a situation I've never encountered I was punished for being upset with myself. On ### I stated to the instructor that this would be what the Director uses to dismiss me from the program. The instructor assured me it wouldn't...wrong! On ### I was immediately removed from class as I walked in and instructed to go to the ###'s office. I walked into the office where a security officer the ### of AH ### of Students and Director were in. I was told "you're being dismissed because you're demeaning and condescending". I asked in what ways for an example. She refused to give it to me and instead said "you're dismissed period. I have my reasons."In my discovery notes that I just received long after my dismissal it states that I was escorted off property by security for getting loud after being dismissed. However I recorded the ENTIRE event I was not escorted off of property. In fact the security officer and I are friends and he walked me out to my car asking if I was okay or if I needed a ride home. Yes I have it on recording.After collecting my thoughts I returned to campus on ### and I asked for access to my disciplinary files so I could begin ### my defense for an appeal hearing. (Keep in mind she said I was escorted off of the property for causing a disturbance if this were true they would have called the police upon my return to trespass me that didn't happen). I recorded my asking of my documents upon returning to the campus. While waiting for them to return with documents I went to the security office to talk with the same officer who was in the meeting my friend. We chatted and he said that what they did seemed illegal and that they should have given me evidence/examples (yes I have this on recording also). The ### returned no documents in hand. Said I could email him if I wanted them. I sent an immediate email requesting my ### protected right to see my files. I was told they were confidential and contained complaints from students and staff that they didn't want me to see. (Keep in mind my complaint from ###... funny how it is only a confidential matter when it works in their favor..hmmm???)An appeal hearing was schedule for ### however I hired an attorney to sit in and witness this hearing of which I notified OTC I would be doing. All of a sudden the meeting was postponed. The appeals hearing finally took place a few days later and I received an email stating they are upholding my dismissal and it is finalized. It wasn't until after this finalization and the threat of a lawsuit that they finally sent me my student disciplinary files and said that they would offer a secondary appeal. However they kept the exact same Appeal's Committee (### of AH was in this meeting/committee). From ### to ### ### not once in that time frame was I brought in to an instructors office to be spoken to about any "offensive or disruptive" behavior. From the meeting that I requested on ### until ### (behavioral contract related to ### not classroom behavior) that was the only point in which I was in any setting to speak about issues that I felt were concerning me in relation to discrimination and bullying by OTCs Nursing staff. At no point between those times (Jan-March) was I brought into any office to speak about any issues concerning me either. From ### until the day I was dismissed on ### there was no contact made by staff at OTC regarding my behaviors. On ### there was no indication that an investigation regarding my dismissal took place (lack of documents) per the OTC handbook stating "the ### or another college administrator designated by the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs shall investigate the alleged violation: The ### and/or other college administrators designated by the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs (â€œdesigneeâ€) will initiate an investigation by contacting all involved parties to schedule an individual meeting obtain a statement in writing detailing the events of the incident in question or review a statement if already available. The length of time of the investigation is dependent on the complexity of the incident and number of individuals involved if applicable. At a minimum the investigation will include interviews of all witnesses identified by the individuals involved in the incident or a review of a written summary of their testimony or a review of a copy of their written statements if already available a review of all relevant records and documents." At no point was I questioned by any faculty at no point was there an investigation that involved documentation provided or reviewed by all parties. Per OTCs handbook section ### â€“ Academic and Course Grade Appeal I was not awarded "equal opportunity to identify and have considered witnesses and other relevant evidence. Similar and timely access to all information considered by the investigators and Student Conduct Panel. Equal opportunity to review any statements or evidence provided by the other party. Equal access to review and comment upon any information independently developed by the investigators."There's more... but I don't want to over burden you. I can't express enough my gratitude. -### "44059.0590277778 I was dismissed from a program at my local community college for disciplinary issues". I asked for more information as to the actual claims related to my dismissal but was denied. I asked to be shown my student file to prepare myself for an appeal to the dismissal I was denied. I attended the dismissal hearing with no preparation as to what I was defending myself against the dismissal was upheld and I was still not given a reason as to my dismissal. It wasn't until AFTER a final decision was made to uphold my dismissal that the college finally released the documents relating to my dismissal.

There never was a court judgment requiring either of your parents to contribute to your college expenses.  I do not know if there is a transcript of the video conference or not, but even if your father promised to pay your tuition he is under no legal obligation to do so now.You can contact the clerk's office where the case was filed concerning a transcript, but it would be a waste of time to pay a court reporter to do a transcript.  Whatever discussions occurred never became enforceable court orders. Since you are ###, I don't know if you are entering your senior year of high school or have already graduated.  Probably you graduated in May.  Your mother could refile another divorce petition or another type of court action, in order to establish an obligation for your father to pay support and contribute towards your college tuition.  However there is no legal obligation for a parent to pay for college, except when ordered to do so as part of a court judgment. This is a common ### from (mostly) fathers in divorce cases -- if I wasn't getting divorced I wouldn't have to pay a dime for college."  Our legal system assumes that to the extent parents can afford to do so they will financially help their children obtain a good education.  The assumption is that caring parents will help their children attend college and have a better chance of success in life.If you have already graduated from high school you must meet the educational requirements for continued parental support in order for your mother to successfully obtain a court order against your father.  Without going through all the details Missouri law requires that you be enrolled and attending a minimum of ### ###st following graduation from high school.  The statute is complicated (see link below).  Community college enrollment might still be a possibility.It is up to your mother to pursue this for you and unfortunately promises which were made do not become an enforceable contract.  I hope you will be able to attend and graduate from college but you cannot force your father (or mother) to help you. Section ###.###:  https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=###.340&bid=33223&hl=Best wishes,2020-09-22 06:44:51" Dear ###,Unfortunately your mother (and father) dismissed the dissolution case.44096.2597222222 My parents were in the process of getting a divorce last year. During the divorce proceedings, my father agreed to pay for my college tuition. He outright told the judge, the GAL, and my Mother's attorney that he would pay for my college tuition. Sadly, my mother ran out of funds, and before final orders were placed, she and my father mutually agreed to end the divorce proceedings and decided to try to work things out apart from the judicial system. My mother made this agreement in good faith with the understanding that my father would pay for my college tuition. Unfortunately, my father now has changed his mind and says that he won't pay for my college. Do I have any legal recourse? I have my mother's support, is there any way we can legally force my father to abide by his word and pay for my college?Further, is there any way I can get a transcript of the court hearing in which my father agreed to pay for my college? The court hearing was held over video chat due to the pandemic. Can I just request the transcripts from the court clerk? How do I go about doing that?Thank you.44096.16875 Thank you for the response. Broadly speaking, what kind of legal action can my mother take to obligate my father to pay for my college? Also, given that I and my mother alike were under the false impression that my father would be paying for my college due to his own statements, can a court extend that ###st deadline?Also, can a case be made that I should receive some kind of compensation for educational neglect? I was ### by my parents and was given almost zero instruction over the course of my childhood. In terms of ###, I had to teach myself multiplication and everything above. I was taught nothing in terms of social science. And, the only thing I was taught in English was very basic reading and writing. My father over the last ### ###, at max. Mind you, most of this was spiritual" instruction. Did I have a right to education that was violated and can a court require compensation for that ### on my rights?I'm in a very tough situation due to the fact that I come from a relatively high-earning family and thus don't qualify for most student aid. I'm hoping to pursue either a law degree or a Ph.D. in political science so without some kind of aid I'll be saddled with an unbearable amount of debt. Again thank you for your time. "44096.89375 Your mother can refile for divorce, file for legal separation or file a petition for custody and support/college expenses.  She needs to go over the situation with a good family law attorney, and decide how to best proceed.  The dishonored promise of financial assistance for college does not create any obligation to help you.  It only shows that your father's word is unreliable, or that he simply changed his mind.  Obviously I do not know all the facts and history, or what your mother's plans are for the future.   But based on your post and the viewable documents on ### from the dismissed divorce case, I would guess that she has been dominated and subjected to at least emotional abuse for quite some time.   The entire family has probably been traumatized.  Emotional or psychological abuse is a form of domestic violence.This is not a subject you should not have to be dealing with, but apparently there are no relatives or others who have intervened to assist your mother in breaking away.  I see that you have two younger siblings, and hope they are coping.  I cannot tell you what to tell your mother or what actions either of you should take.  I realize you are an ### old living in a very, very complex situation.  It may be that eventually you will need to do what is necessary to get away for your own well-being.  Victims of domestic abuse like your mother who have stayed with their abuser frequently cannot maintain the assertiveness and stamina to get away, and frequently return.   Again I'm guessing, but it looks like your mother was manipulated to fire her lawyer and dismiss the divorce case.   I'm pretty sure that I've ### beyond the boundaries of this civil law question/answer forum into speculation.So as already said, your mother can hire an attorney and pursue legal action.  She has two other children that need support and protection.  However she needs to decide what she wishes to do.  The judge may or may not require your father to support you unless you meet the educational requirements for support.  I would never predict how a judge will rule in any particular case.  The judge can waive the ###st deadline (and probably should in your case), but waivers are not very common.  Your mother needs a good attorney. You might have the possibility of suing your parents for educational neglect, although there are few of these cases.  You're going to likely need to find an attorney in St. ### or ### City, and do some searching.  If you can find an attorney to file the suit for you, there are obviously other family dynamics which will be affected.  Suing your parents is not to be undertaken lightly, particularly if you have not already secured a good living arrangement away from them.You might benefit from contacting reputable counseling hotlines, such as a national hotline:  https://www.thehotline.org/This type of organization is more likely to be able to refer you to resources closer to your home.  I strongly urge you and your mother to seek counseling, separately.I hope your mother becomes capable of protecting herself and her children, but please always remember that victims of domestic violence have great difficulty ending the control & cycle of abuse.  Being realistic, wary of the difficulties you may encounter and also hopefulfor you, you may be the only person you can count on.  You write well and ask good questions.   Best wishes.44097.1513888889 A previous school district my children attended during the ###### school year is with holding my children's original copy of their Immunization exemption  waviers/forms . The school nurse stated legally they now have to keep them on record for ### , irregardless if the student  is still attending the school district or not . I need only ###'s forms to allow her to start her new school at a completely different school district.  The forms themselves have to be got specifically from the county health department.  My county's health department cannot get me in by appt to get a new form until ###th due to covid.  Both school districts the past and new have stated that the law changed and they now require the original form/wavier to be on file .  They cannot accept a copy of it which was the standard practice until last year . My ### ###th , after missing many weeks of school .  I have searched online hard for either the Missouri legal statue regarding public school in Missouri , and the legal change requiring the original copy of exemption be on file before attending.  I have be unable to find Missouri legal statue regarding public school and requirement that states the orginal copy be held on file for ###,  despite the student not attending the school or the Statue that states I cannot legally obtain my child orginal copy of it .   Is any of this legal ? How can I go about getting my child into school before ###th,  while still retaining and standing for my religious/ philosophical right to not vaccinate ?  Any help, advice , or point in right direction will be very much appreciated and help a ### .

However these last ###.  44097.9673611111 Dear Ms. ###,Similar to you, I have not found any express language in Missouri statutes about keeping original immunization/exemption records. The ### website is somewhat instructive, and informs that schools generally keep these records for only a year or two after the student graduates transfers to another school or leaves the school system." https://www.###.gov/vaccines/parents/records/find-records.html#:~:text=Child's%20schoolor%20leaves%20the%20school%20system. This leads me to believe that this is probably a county-wide regulation which establishes that schools must keep records for ###. ### County's school district. So yes keeping your child's original immunization/exemption records is most likely legal. It is surprising that in COVID times the school your child is now set to attend is still requiring strict compliance with deadlines. I hope you were able to explain to the new school that you would only be able to secure the necessary forms after school started because of COVID and that the school allowed your child to attend.RegardsBernardo"44116.5625 A bar in downtown ### sent video footage and the credit card receipts to our college from a night at their bar.  8-###.  Can the bar legally send that information without a third party, a warrant, or our consent since all of use are over age 21?  We attend a private university.  We are trying to find out if this is legal or if we have a case that the information sent was done wrongfully.  We have students that play football and are facing consequences as a result of this being sent and wondering if damages could be involved as well.  One is all American and has lost the opportunity to play a game and have footage sent to coaches as a result of this. 44116.925 There is no right to privacy when in a public space so the bar was free to take video of you and your friends and send it wherever it chose. Iâ€™m guessing that you and your friends were making very poor choices and are now looking for some way to hold someone else responsible for your lack of judgment. Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t help you. 44117.04375 Have you requested all documents that you signed, in writing? Have you received any?Did you have some understanding of the need to repay or pay at all?If you did not then do not sign anything new. It could create an obligation that may not exist.  I cannot read the Residency handbook so I cannot comment. Let me know where you stand. 44138.1284722222 I do not know anyone but it is a simple matter of contract law so a lawyer that handles civil lawsuits should be able to assist. 44138.6208333333 I have requested documents with my signature several times via email, but she has avoided sending them to me. the request for repayment of the $6,###, not beforehand or during. It was also only verbally stated by the director, but never in writing that the $6,###, it was just mentioned as a general cost of the course, but not as a tuition cost for the residents (myself) to repay. I will not sign anything she sends, I just wanted to make sure I was in the right. I have also offered a counter payment option to her since services were rendered, but she did not acknowledge that either. Thank you so much! 44138.1569444444 Perfect. Thank you so much for all your help! I really appreciate it. You stay safe and healthy as well! 44138.6479166667 Thank you! I simply asked a ###, she did not offer it, and so I will not respond and seek an attorney for representation. Do you potentially know of anyone who does this kind of law in the St. ### area? 44138.61875 The program I was in to become a certified teacher is demanding back $6,### â€œdeferred tuition paymentâ€. I never signed a document acknowledging there was a tuition of this amount, that the $6,###, or that I would pay this amount back. The director of the program cannot provide me with the document with my signature acknowledging the $6,###, the automatic ### of the tuition, or that I would pay that amount back. The director has been sending me a DocuSign agreement persistently for the last few days demanding I sign, but this document appears to be the loan/tuition agreement and repayment agreement. There are only ###, and she is also unwilling to negotiate a feasible monthly repayment amount outside of the two options on the document, neither of which is possible on any teacher salary. I have not signed the DocuSign she has sent me. I have attached screenshots of the DocuSign, as well as the contract in our Residency Handbook that we signed. The Residency Handbook is the only document I have ever signed for this program, aside from the agreement to serve which also does not mention a tuition. Am I obligated to pay back the amount in the manner in which is demanded on the DocuSign if I never signed anything prior to ### beginning acknowledging that there is a significant tuition cost and that I would have to repay it in this manner? The director of the program is demanding I sign before Friday so she can send me the invoice for repayment. Thank you so much! 44138.0777777778 You are welcome and stay safe. If they do not respond to your requests you should not make any further attempts to resolve this since they may use your response as an admission that you owe the money. 44138.6152777778 Hi, ### - Thank you for sharing this information. I know it is challenging trying to figure out schooling during the pandemic, and must be even more challenging when adding the layer of attempting to receive adequate accommodations for your child. I hope I can help you resolve this issue with your son's school. May I ask, is your son diagnosed by a medical professional for his ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety? Or is he diagnosed for any one of these conditions? Has he received accommodations in school before? This is important because if he does have a documented diagnosis, then he likely is entitled to protections and accommodations under several federal laws, three in particular: the Americans with Disabilities Act (###), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and Section ###. These three laws work together to provide protections for individuals, including children, with disabilities. I'm going to link a website here that will provide you with more explanation and information on these laws: Missouri Parents Act. If you have documentation of your son's disabilities, I advise you to provide this documentation to his school, explain that he is protected under federal law and entitled to reasonable accommodations, and that you would like to work with them to come up with those reasonable accommodations. Prior to this conversation, it may be helpful for you to get a letter from your son's doctor explaining his disability and why this particular accommodation (going ###) is both reasonable and necessary. The more documentation you have, the better. If the school further chooses to deny your son this accommodation, I believe it would be appropriate for you to consult with an attorney who specializes in this type of issue so that they can advocate for you more specifically. In particular, an attorney who specializes in disability rights would be best. I hope this information is helpful to you, and I wish you and your son the best of luck as you navigate this difficult issue. If you have any follow up questions, please feel free to respond. Best, ###44146.6756944444 My son is a Freshman at Park Hill South. He is currently hybrid, wit ###-person. Because of the structure and lack of instruction he is currently (1st quarter and now beginning 2nd qtr) he is failing ### ###. We have worked with teachers. It isn't helping. He went to speak with his counselor today to request being changed to 100% online, a system he was 100% successful in during the spring. He was told no, he could change at semester, but he cannot make the change now. He is ADHD, and is currently experiencing severe anxiety and depression due to the back and forth and lack of structure. Traditional school is very difficult for him. How do I go about getting the school to allow the change without having to full out withdraw him from the district? If withdraw to homeschooling is my only option, how will that effect my ###, but in ###???This is 100% my sons want, he came to me asking if I was ok and would support the change. Now that the counselor has told him no, I don't know what the steps, process, or options are to do what is best for my son and his education. ### ###### ### 44140.7034722222 My family lived in Nebraska last year and had a truancy case and we moved to missouri during summer.

Before hiring an attorney to do so, make sure that your contract doesnâ€™t have a mandatory arbitration provision or a provision requiring that any lawsuit be filed in a specific court. Best wishes. 44209.1555555556 I filed a complaint against an abusive ex-boyfriend of mine who had used his position in the Supplemental Instruction (SI) program to threaten my education. This complaint was filed when I was asked to come in to the Title IX office at my school and speak about this issue, because they had received an anonymous compliant that my ex-boyfriend was using his position of power over other women in the class and generally making his students uncomfortable. I went in and spoke about it because I had to take a class that he was to be an SI leader for during an 8-week sectionto escape him, and received a B-. When I took the second (harder) part of the class, I received an A. I did not want him to hold a position of power like that over me in any of my other classes. They wrote me a letter of support, received a list of my classes and what semesters I would be taking them in, and promised me that he would not be allowed in a position of power over me ever again. Now, this man has been allowed into a similar position in one of my required classes, and the director of our Title IX office is refusing to do anything about it because I did not go through with a formal investigation. I don't feel comfortable doing so now, because I do not feel that it will be done in a timely manner, I am scared that he will try to retaliate, and I do not feel like I will be treated fairly by them. I cannot find it in myself to attend my online class because I am terrified to even hear his voice. I have been working with them for three weeks now, since ###, and they have just now told me this. I have to take this class because it is required for the graduate program I plan on entering after I finish my undergraduate studies. I am scared about the effects that this will have on my GPA, my future, and my mental health. They have my PTSD diagnosis, stemming from this relationship, on file. They also have ###, I had a witness give a statement about his physical abuse, and I have text messages about the time he tried to break into my apartment. I have expressed this to the director of the Title IX office and she has not even acknowledged it. I know it's not right for the school to allow my mental health and education to suffer so this man can boost his resume, all because he got fired from his last position for his own behavior. I don't know where to go from here or how to continue fighting for myself. More details but I can't submit them without exceeding the word limit. 44237.8215277778 Hello, My ex husband is trying to make me pay half for a private high school that he wants to send our son to.I don't have the extra money to pay half and he is telling me that I am responsible for half and make it work.44249.7527777778 Dear Ms. ###,You should carefully review your dissolution decree and parenting plan, with your attorney if necessary, to determine if there would be a basis to compel you to make payment of part of the private school tuition. Very generally speaking, you are not required to pay for expenses not included in your decree and parenting plan.You should also consider that your decree could possibly be modified in the future based on the increased private school expenses.Best wishes.44249.9486111111 Hello, I want my son to attend public school and my ex wants him attend a private high school.  Will I be required to pay half?I don't believe this is in our divorce decree.44249.8888888889 I sent an email to a principal saying that my ### daughter brokeup with her boyfriend and shs does not want to be around him. To have the teachers watch them and gave ### principal my number if there was any questions. The boy's mom is also a teacher at the high school. The principal had my daughter go to her office to questions her. My daughter felt like she had to answer her questions.I found out the night prior my daughter was sexually assualted by the boy. I made a police report.My questions is what legal action can I do?44259.8625 Legal action for what? Against the principal? Perhaps I'm not understanding as there is more to this than your post includes but based upon what you have indicated there is no basis for any legal action against the school or the principal.44259.8930555556 The principal has substantial discretion in questioning students about things related to the student body such as issues between students. Perhaps if you had shared more with the principal she might have been more sensitive to the issue. With the information that the principal had it only makes sense that she would ask your daughter about the issue. Public schools have broad authority to conduct inquiries and perform investigations so it would be exceedingly difficult to pursue any type of legal action against the school or the principal based upon what you have described. As a father with three daughters (one of whom has been sexually assaulted), I can fully appreciate your desire to protect your daughter. But unless there was something particularly egregious about the way in which the principal questioned your daughter I do not see any potential liability.If your concern is future harm to your daughter by school personnel I recommend a face-to-face meeting to discuss your concerns. Do not arrive at the meeting all ready to get into it but rather open-minded with a desire to ensure fair treatment for your daughter. If you start by attacking the school staff I can assure you that they will circle the ### and become very defensive. Alternatively, if you approach them calmly expressing a desire to arrive at a consensus as to the best way to ensure minimal contact between your daughter and the ex-boyfriend assailant the school is likely to accommodate you. It may be difficult but it is important that you not repeatedly refer to the ex as having assaulted your daughter. Note I'm not saying to brush that under the rug. You should state the reason for the need to maintain distance between the ex and your daughter. Just don't keep hammering the point and calling him offensive names as that will only lead them to feel defensive since a member of the staff is the boy's mother. I suggest that you seek out appropriate care for your daughter as soon as possible. This type of event can have devastating effects on her that may not even show up right away. It is important that she get the help necessary to process what she is going through in a positive fashion - or perhaps the least negative fashion possible. I wish you and your daughter strength and patience as you work through this struggle together.44259.9465277778 Yes legal action against the principal. My daughter was sexually assaulted this passed sunday. I made report with the local police, so there is an active investigation going on. I email the principal to just keep an on the exboyfriend to make sure he was not bothering my daughter. I did not disclose any information to the principal because the exboyfriend mother is a teacher in the ###. The principal instead of calling me to ask more questions. The principal ### my daughter in her office ###. Made my ### old daughter fill like she had to answer questions and to relive the incident by telling the principal that she was sexually assaulted.44259.9013888889 I have created a visual art piece for the production of ### at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I'm a student instructed by the theatrical director and director the production to create a piece that reflects on the past year and how society came together during the pandemic. My visual art piece uses the public domain and social media pages through screen recordings and downloadable links; as well as front pages of the New York Times. The production is about to start tonight I have until next Saturday before they film the scene with my visual art piece.I looked the FAIR Use Act of 2007. It states that creators can use copyright materials if they are changed in some way. However, the Fair Use Act doesn't allow the creator to use other people's work for profit. This conundrum is my question. Can the work be altered by a student for a project and used in the theatrical production. 44281.8222222222 Hi ###,  I'm so sorry that you and your son are dealing with such a difficult situation.  It sounds absolutely horrible.  I recommend that you contact the law firm DMZ in ### City - https://drzlawfirm.com/   The attorneys there have experience with lawsuits against schools for bullying.  I honestly don't know what they attorneys there will tell you, but I know them and trust that they'll give you an honest evaluation of your potential case.   I would also suggest that you continue advocating for your son both within the school - to his individual teachers, the guidance counselor, and the principals - and also with the school board.  Lawsuits take an extremely long time so please don't wait.  I also suggest that you start writing down every time you reach out to the school or school board, whether they respond or not, and also document every negative incident your son has at school, in case you might use this information as evidence in the future.  Every time you write something down, document the date and time it occurred, and be very specific about who you talked to and what was said.  Keep all emails, texts, voicemails, notes from the school, etc. as well.  Please let me know if you have follow-up questions I can assist with.  Please take care and hang in there.  -### ### 44309.0840277778 my son who is ###. They have ostracized him to the point he finds every excuse not to go to school. They have called DFS on me.

She has a stable home, working parents and there are no pending court actions.  She currently lives in ###.  I reside in the small town of Ashburnham. This is totally voluntary, and what we think will be in her best interests.  The question I have relates to high school. If she does well academically in 8th grade here in Ashburnham,  she would like to apply to ### Tech Vocational in Fitchburg for high school.  Ashburnham is in the district.  ### is not.I've looked at their application and it is confusing to me. I'm not legally  her guardian. There is no legal  basis to obtain  guardianship.  but she will be living in Ashburnham.   I think that means she can apply, but I don't want to give her false hope.  She would benefit,  on so many levels  if that is an option.  The application to ### Tech won't be due til March.  It would help me  tremendously in providing her guidance and motivation if know it's a goal I can encourage and support. Any assistance you could provide in this matter would be veryhelpful.

Legal Answers On-Line.  One of my areas of legal practice was housing law, and I am familiar with the concepts of reasonable accommodation" in that context; and I hope that the concepts that I know would be similar to the concepts as applied to your case (about which I had no experience).  I will try to respond helpfully given that reservation.It appears that the laws of reasonable accommodation do apply to your situation.  (The ### actions imply so -- their forms and their consideration of your request imply that much.)  I believe that the college not only was required by the laws against discrimination (which incorporate the concepts of "reasonable accommodation" in situations where a person makes a request for an accommodation based on the person's disability or handicap) to respond to your specific request but also to engage in meaningful discussions to consider other options.  So you would have grounds to request a further discussion for your feasible options.  Possibly you need to consider what other options might work for you without causing an undue burden on the college -- for instance asking for extra time before you take any final examination/testing in order to get tutoring or video review for the missed classes.  In that discussion to rebut the ### ### you could cite their flyers that imply accommodations being offered to students who miss classes due to Covid or other illnesses.  You could ask how those students made up for missed classes.  You might need to be prepared to present documentation of your disability and the medical need for your surgery.  Your age should not be a factor in any decision made by the college.I have no idea if your original request (to watch one class via Zoom) was unreasonable or not because I do not know the ### reasoning.  Presumably it was the ### decision to make and not the teacher who made the final decision.  The college might have adopted the teacher's reasoning.  I do not know what content you missed in the ###-###; but possibly it was crucial to becoming an accredited interpreter.  (Possibly it was some ### attendance measure that could be irrelevant to your success as an interpreter.)If you decide to make a legal complaint about the ### denial of your request for a reasonable accommodation then I recommend that you retain an experienced attorney    to advise or represent you.Good luck.

One student applied for a temporary license which carries similar requirements for licensing except passing the certification exam. The temporary license allows one to work while they await taking the certification exam and receive their results. Since his application stated he would be graduating with a bachelors degree; FL DOH denied it. This triggered the conversation with FL DOH that made us aware of this wording mistake on the ###. Hence, although you state we are worrying before it actually happens, it will inevitably occur once we do apply for our licenses. Therefore we our trying to be proactive in finding a remedy to this problem.In addition, we are all passing with high grades, we will graduate, we do not have a final exam in PA school. Based on practice exams provide by NCCPA we are all ### to pass the Certification exam. My question in the last paragraph of my post is the advice I was seeking.

Best wishes. 44442.7118055556 My son's father has sole custody, but my son is currently living with me because there have been allegations of abuse. His father is aware that is with me. The issue is he won't sign any paperwork for the school enrollment because he feels like he's signing his rights away. I have told him that's not how it works, the school administrator and principal also informed him that that's not what was going to happen. Legally I have no rights to my son, he is 17, and the issue with school is it's a different district. His father wants him to continue going to the previous School which is ###. I know that I can file with the courts for custody, but the issue but that is how long it takes. I've tried to educate myself as far as maybe him being emancipated, and he is able to financially care for himself, he does have a job but he resides with me. The other option was the parent give consent for emancipation, which his father won't do.  So I guess my question is how do I enroll him without having custody or him signing the paperwork? His father isn't concerned about his well-being. My son has alleged physical abuse. It hasn't been reported because there was no proof, and also for the fear of my child being placed back in his home if we are getting DFS or children's services involved. His father has no desire to have any relationship with him I have many text messages and recorded phone calls to prove that. Time or lack of is the issue at this point. He legally has to attend school, and with him residing with me and using my address he would need to go to this district, is there something that I can do to get my son enrolled in school? Are there any laws or anything that would allow him to enroll himself or something? I've done everything I could possibly think of besides hiring legal help which I intend to do but until then I don't know what else to do. Thank you for your time.44426.2479166667 I suggest that you reread your post. You clearly stated that the school policy is that students cannot have their phones on them during the school day therefore they must leave their phones in the office until the end of the day." So by leaving the phone with the teacher instead of in the office a school policy is being violated. Additionally you are asking the teacher to violate the school policy putting her job in jeopardy in the process. If you are truly concerned about the principal having access to the phone then add a strong password to open it."44446.6465277778 My ###. His school has a policy that students cannot have their phones on them during the school day therefore they must leave their phones in the office until the end of the day. I am completely ok with this policy, however, I do not trust the princapal due tho the manner in which he conducted himself last year with my son. So I made arrangements with the teacher/friend who helps me out occasionaly after school by bringing him home for me if she ### holding his phone for him during the day so that the principal doesn't have access to his phone, she agreed. He turns his phone off when he gets to the school and hands it to her, she then puts it in her desk along with her daughters phone until the end of the school day and then she gives the phones back to them. No school policy is being viloated because the students do not have their phones on or with them during the school day. He is only allowed to take his phone to school because I sometimes do not get home until after he is at home and I want him to be able to contact help if any is needed as we ### not have a land line, or if he would like my permission to go somewhere after to school with a friend.The principal on two occasionas now has went into the teacher room and took my sons phone saying that she isn't allowed to have it. Is this even legal? Can he take my phone away from an adult that I hve given permission to have my phone?The teacher feels violated as do I in this situation.44440.9743055556 Hello Ms. Pamperl,The police would not be permitted to question a minor for suspicion of criminal conduct without making a parent available to the child if he so requested.  However, the school authorities are not subject to the same restrictions.  They simply have no legal obligation to confer with a child's parent(s) when investigating allegations of some kind of misconduct. 44460.74375 My child got in trouble at school for saying vulgar lyrics to a song. The girl that told on him also has come forward saying that her friend said that my son (who is 13) touched her inappropriately two years ago at a pool.

Did they have the right to make him write a statement without our knowledge?44460.7263888889 Dear Mr. ###,This forum is for posting specific civil law questions. Volunteer attorneys on this site do not provide consultations or actual representation. The answer to your question (Why is my daughter required to wear a ###...?) Is most likely that the school district's pandemic rules are designed to protect everyone.   You have the option of virtual school if your daughter is medically unable or unwilling to follow the ### rules.You might be able to revisit the issue with school authorities along these lines:1..Obtain a written statement from your daughter's doctor explaining why she is medically unable to wear a ###;###.  Provide proof your daughter has been fully vaccinated:###.  Provide proof that all household  members who are eligible to be vaccinated have been vaccinated;###.  Provide current negative Covid-###;5.  Provide a professional written diagnosis stating why your daughter's special needs prevent doing schooling virtually;  and6.  Offer to agree to social distancing and possible isolation within the school environment.  For example your daughter might need to eat her lunch in the ### area.With all of these perhaps you can agree on a way.for your child to attend at least partially in person.Otherwise you need to accept virtual school or enroll your daughter in a private or ### school with different ### options.You can also hire a local attorney to discuss if there is any legal basis to file a lawsuit against the school district.  However this will be costly and probably ill-advised.  Consider the potential fallout on your daughter.Best wishes. "44461.7979166667 HelloMy ###### ###.

Volunteer attorneys on this site do not provide consultations, individual case evaluations or actual representation. I cannot determine from what you wrote if you have any basis for a lawsuit.  If you are asking if you can compel another school district to enroll your children because you are unhappy with the bus driver, the answer is most likely no."You should retain an attorney for advice and possible representation.   Your attorney can review the factual history in detail.   If the attorney believes there is an action to be brought he or she can give you an estimate of the potential cost.  An attorney might also be useful to represent you in discussions with school officials to find an acceptable way to handle ### the children.In the interim you need to get your children back in school before possible involvement with the Department of Social Services.   If you're not planning to move to another district enroll the children in private school or home school them perhaps you could drive them to school or arrange alternate transportation while resuming communication with the proper school administrators and school board about your driver complaints?It is highly unlikely that another school district is required to accept your non-resident students.

Do you think I have a case?44466.7020833333 Hello, I signed a contract to pay a private school monthly and recently pulled him due to disagreeance in policy. This contract was signed with the a verbal and written agreement (email correspondence) that the annual contract would be modified for a December revaluation. They failed to modify the contract and I have not heard back from the school as to whether they are going to modify it. I have not signed or been presented any exotic paperwork. I am willing to pay up until December, the agreed modified contract terms. What can I do, legally, when they finally contact me? Is there any state laws that can help my situation? Thank you in advance.44466.7784722222 You are going to be bound by the ###s of the written contract that you signed. No oral agreements or any email discussions can alter the ###s of the written contract. The only exception is if one of the ###s in the written contract is deemed ambiguous. In that event, admitting outside evidence of what the parties intended (### evidence) can be considered to ensure that the parties' original intent.I'm guessing that you are referring to changes to the agreement after the parties agreed to and signed. I cannot speak to the ###s of a contract that I have not seen. However, any competently written contract contains a provision along the following lines:This Agreement is the final, complete, and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties. No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties.That language makes it clear that any change to the contract must be in writing and signed by both parties before it has any legal effect. Additionally, any attempt to change the contract from its original ###s is ineffective even if signed by the parties if not supported by consideration from both sides. Consideration is a legal ### that means that you gave something for it. If you buy a widget from me for $10, that is a binding contract supported by consideration. I received $10, and you received a widget. Quite often, folks try to renegotiate ###s and completely overlook the requirement of consideration from both sides.To provide an example, let's say that you signed a contract for your child to go to school for the whole year in exchange for $10k. Halfway through the school year, you are unhappy with the school and complain. The school agrees that your child will stop attending the school, and you are only on the hook for $###. That is an enforceable contract as both you and the school got something out of it. You paid half as much, and the school only had to provide half the schooling. Now let's modify those facts slightly to you and the school, agreeing that you only have to pay $### for the full school year instead of the original amount. That is not an enforceable modification of the contract because the school received no consideration. The school still had to provide a full year's worth of schooling, but it is not getting paid for a full school year.An important factor is that while both parties must provide consideration, the consideration need not be equivalent. So in that last example, you also agree to throw in snow ### services for the year, but the school is in Saudi Arabia, where it never snows. Technically the school got consideration for allowing you to reduce the amount paid for the education even though the value of that consideration (snow-plow service in the desert) is pretty much $0. That said, most folks don't understand that any such change needs mutual consideration. Consequently, they may agree to something without recognizing that it may not be legally enforceable. 44466.8861111111 Does any public school have the legal authority to require that me and my children wear face ### in a public outdoor space? The location is not on school grounds/property.44470.7111111111 What you are referring to is a school-sponsored function. As such, yes the school has the legal right to dictate requirements. You certainly don't have to participate in the school function, but if you choose to, then you must comply with the school's requirements.44470.7888888889 A trained professional educator is in the best  position to objectively evaluate any child's status compared to others in a class, grade level or particular age.  Most pediatricians are not speech-language pathologists.  No offense was intended or should be taken to these facts.I hope you will work with school staff to determine IF your child actually has a problem.  Delaying a possible diagnosis and can further exacerbate  a problem.Best wishes.44477.7555555556 Dear Ms. Vinzant,This forum is for posting specific civil law questions.   I cannot find any legal question to answer, nor do I see anything improper about the teacher's conduct.Apparently you have an objection to school staff trying to evaluate your daughter's ### progress.  From what you wrote, the teacher has observed a significant deficit in this area.  While you do not ###, the teacher is in a better position to evaluate this objectively and is just doing her job. Delaying a thorough evaluation would seem to be an inappropriate response.  A child's best interests are usually served by parents working in sync with school staff to promptly pursue an evaluation and diagnosis of any  possible issues. If appropriate, the child can receive additional services through the school district and//or the parents can receive recommendations for private therapy or treatment.  Generally speaking, the proper course of action would be to set up a meeting between the parents, the teacher and school counselor as soon as possible.   This would enable everyone to fully understand the situation, and develop a collaborative strategy to best help the child.Best wishes.44477.6833333333 Funny her pediatrician doesn't agree with the situation.

My rights have been violated, and I have suffered immensely as a result, but nobody cares. My question is, what should I do next? Is there a resource I haven't tried yet? What are my options if I still haven't found a lawyer before my ###? Can I turn the case back over to the ###? 44479.7916666667 I don't understand why the silent treatment doesn't meet the definition of retaliation. CMU guarantees in writing that ALL grievances will be investigated and responded to quickly. They completely ignored my official complaints filed through their own official grievance system. The policy didn't say all grievances unless they are made by an autistic epileptic in which case we reserve the right to completely ignore them." I had as much right as anybody to have my concerns addressed. The accommodation I had been approved for in writing was not being enforced and they refused to even acknowledge my official grievance using their own official grievance system. I requested an additional accommodation that they have in writing as reasonable and available and they completely ignored that too.  I asked for help getting enrolled in summer classes and they completely ignored me. They didn't respond at all. I filed a complaint about them not responding to my request for help enrolling in summer classes and they completely ignored that too. How is that not retaliating against me by denying me services available to everyone else except me?As far as billing me this time and not last time goes I had already thoroughly participated in classes and turned in multiple assignments in Fall ### too. It was the end of the first week then too. I was not charged because I let Dr. Brink talk me out of filing a complaint. What makes this time different if not retaliation?"44480.5875 I have looked at your response to the Missouri Human Rights Commission on the billing issue, and your conclusions from that material are not reasonable. The school has its policies regarding the refunding of money when someone drops classes detailed on its website. The standard rule is that you do not get all of your money back. The email from ### ###nk made it clear that she submitted the request to the Director for the Center for Learning and Teaching and the Provost to see if it would be approved for you to receive a full refund. The email from ### Hilgedick, Registrar, merely confirmed that your withdrawal request would be processed. The first email expressly stated it required the Director's ... and the Provost's" approval for you to receive a full refund. As ### Hilgedick was in the ### office her email could not be considered to have been confirmation that a different department had agreed to refund fully. You need to understand that just because the school made an exception and accommodated you the prior semester doesn't ### to retaliation by not making an exception the next semester.All of that aside the most important point I made in my initial response to you was that this is not a case that will make financial sense for an attorney to handle on a contingent fee basis. Accordingly I suggested that you contact the closest law schools to see if they can assist you or file suit yourself and ask the court to appoint an attorney. Beyond that I cannot help you any further."44480.6451388889 Iâ€™m sorry to hear that you have had this experience in your education. No doubt it is very frustrating. I too have a seizure disorder leading to me being booted from Chemistry class by an overly concerned instructor. I also have a daughter that struggles with significant mental health issues requiring accommodations in school, so I am familiar with what you are dealing with. That said, you likely arenâ€™t going to be happy with what I tell you.Discrimination cases generally are not that very viable in Missouri. Juries here are very conservative (read that to mean they donâ€™t like discrimination cases and award very little). Add the absence of any significant monetary damages and you are looking at a case that isnâ€™t very attractive to a plaintiffâ€™s attorney. You said several attorneys claimed you have a great case, but werenâ€™t going to take it. You need to understand that is not uncommon amongst plaintiff attorneys. Many fear getting sued later on by someone saying that the attorney convinced them that they didnâ€™t have a case when they did but now it is too late. I always found that to be a poor way to handle it back when I did a lot of plaintiffâ€™s work. I routinely had folks come into my office with terrible cases claiming another attorney said it was a great case. So letâ€™s talk about your case. The law regarding educational institutions doesnâ€™t interfere with the way material is taught and grades are determined, leaving that almost exclusively to the institutions themselves. The reasonibeing that to do otherwise would lead to the courts becoming inundated with grading disputes which it isnâ€™t competent to resolve. Your suggestion in the letter to the ### that there be a law requiring that the same amount of work for the same amount of points would create a nightmare for schools and the courts alike. Additionally, other than your initial issue with the professor, the allegations of discrimination and retaliation fall short of discrimination. Contrary to your assertion, â€œsilenceâ€ isnâ€™t retaliation. Dropping a class after a certain date routinely isnâ€™t done without charges. I donâ€™t know exactly what the professor did that you felt was so discriminatory, as you only described it in conclusory terms, but at the college level, professors donâ€™t have to be as accommodating as teachers in high school. The right to sue letter is automatically issued at a specific point in time without regard to whether or not you have a viable case. If you donâ€™t file suit within the applicable time frame you will be permanently precluded from pursuing it. You might try checking with the closest law schools to see if they have some type of civil rights clinic. That would involve you being represented by a law student under the direction of a professor or licensed attorney. Alternatively, you can file suit pro se and ask the court to appoint an attorney to represent you. 44479.9388888889 Hi ###,I'm very sorry this happened. You're probably not going to like this answer, but yes, the school can search him. They only need a reasonable suspicion" that they might uncover evidence that he broke a law or a school rule. The Supreme Court decided that when children are at school they do not have the same Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches that adults have. The school only must have a reasonable suspicion. School officials almost always have a reasonable suspicion. For example if smoking isn't allowed on school property and a student smells like smoke that's reasonable suspicion that the student is carrying cigarettes. Schools stand in the place of a parent when the child is at school so they have more authority to search a child than a police officer on the street. But even on school property the search must be reasonable. They can't strip search a student because they think he broke a rule about chewing gum in class even if they might find gum on him.If your grandson is stopped again he can always say no to a search. He shouldn't physically resist but often authority figures will ask to search in such a way that you think you don't have a choice. But you actually do! If they ask if he will open his bag he should say no. This is true with police officers as well. If they ask it like a question say no. Even if they don't say no. If they want to search you they might anyway but just by saying no you've shielded yourself from many possible consequences. Just never physically resist if they go through with the search anyway. I hope this was helpful. And again I'm sorry this happened."44492.1069444444 It was very helpful and I thank you so much.44492.3854166667 My ###. His mother was not notified so they didn't have consent. Is it legal for the school to searching without consent or a parent present?44491.6083333333 Hi Karie,First of all, I'm very sorry this is happening. That's a terrible situation for both you and your children to be in. I can offer some general advice, but your legal remedies are limited.As a general plan going forward, your children need to begin documenting every incident. I know this is a lot to ask of them at their ages so it will probably fall to you to write down everything they tell you when they get home from school. Making a record of the incidents will give you a better idea of any laws that the teachers might be violating and also give you specific instances to discuss with the teachers and staff when you meet with them about the problems.Second, teachers are not perfect and they will make mistakes. The law recognizes this by not imposing liability unless there is an extreme instance of bullying or a consistent pattern of bullying over time. This is another reason to write down any incidents that happen. The most effective remedy for immediate relief is to have an open discussion with the teachers and try to develop a plan for how to go forward. For example, the teacher can remind your daughter each day that she needs to write down her homework assignments and then give them to you as soon as she gets home. You should also discuss the bullying issue with your son's teachers and ask what the plan is to stop the bully from continuing. Every school in Missouri must have an ### policy. You can ask to see it and ask for resources on how your school expects you to report bullying behavior. Teachers may have different perspectives on things and they might be unfairly judging your son based on past experiences with other students. To correct this you will need to explain to the teacher the things they don't know about your son and why he shouldn't be judged based on the teacher's past experiences. For example, you can acknowledge that some students abuse the bathroom policy to get out of class, but also explain that was not what your son was doing. The teacher should give your son a chance to prove himself.You can ask for regular progress reports. Since your legal remedies are limited, you will need to work with the teachers and school officials to develop effective learning plans going forward. If things do not improve, consult an education attorney, and discuss your options. I'm sorry that I couldn't be of more help. I hope everything improves after some ###, honest conversations.44496.59375 I also wanted to say that my son had been punished many times for going to the bathroom. He had to do laps for needing to go to the bathroom. I had him checked out to see if he had a bladder infection and he had a very high load of ### in his urine. I did give that letter to the school and it evetually stopped but no child should be punished for going to the bathroom.  Please they are picking on my children and im not getting any progress reports no email.  I feel these teachers are bullying my children. 44495.9631944444 My daughter and son go to rRchland, Missouri elementary school. My son has been bullied and has been sent to the office many times because of crying. The bully still remains in school talking to my son when he walks by him making noises. His teacher called me on the phone to have a conference and said that my son did not raise his hand in class to ask for help so i told him to start doing that because he would cry during class because math was too hard he felt confused. The next day my son said he raised his hand and the teacher said, I already told you." My son started to cry and so then after he said she told him to come over I'll help you. The teachers also seem to be bullying.Today my daughter which is in 2nd grade was excited to go to the park for a field trip with her friends. My daughter has never gotten into trouble. She has always been a very sweet girl. Today she came home crying because she said she didn't get to go to the park and had to stay in school because she did not pass a reading assignment. I never new about this assignment  nor do i get any homework for her. I have no clue how she is doing in school. My son either there is never homework and i have no clue other than if he tells me he or she is crying. I am very frustrated. I feel the school is just ruining my childrens self esteem. My son has started to call himself stupid and now i hear my daughter saying the same thing to herself. What should i do if the school does nothing. I have met with the principle about homework but i do not get any for the children and i have no clue how well they are doing. I feel they are being punished for just needing help with some subjects they are behind in.  What should i do? I have called the superintendent and she use to be the principle of the elementary school last year. I feel like im getting no where with this school.  Thank youKarie ### K"44495.95625 Dear Ms. ###,This forum is for posting specific questions about civil law.  Volunteer attorneys who respond to questions on this site do not provide consultations, individual case evaluations or actual representation. It appears you may have misunderstood this site, as there is no question about civil law in what you wrote.  Apparently you are looking for an attorney to represent you concerning your complaints with the charter school and list of demands.This site is also not for finding an attorney to hire.  The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function which you can utilize to attempt to find an appropriate attorney to hire.  LINK:  https://mobar.org/public/LawyerSearch.aspxBest wishes.44505.1319444444 On 10/###. As a result, my son suffered a concussion. I was not contacted nor was my son given any assistance afterwards besides a band-aid for the scratch on his ### from his ### when he fell forward. He informed a few members on staff, however no one explained the incident to Thai's ### teacher Ms.Weaver, who would have contacted me right away. Between Eagle College Fox Park's principal, ###, and Regional Manager there were many mistakes from the school such as, supervision ###, lack of incident reporting, and ignoring policy and procedures in general.Eagle Fox Park leadership (Ms Greenough + Ms. ###) claimed there was a video of the incident. They claimed that my son fell backwards and landed on his back, never hitting his head, accusing my son of not being truthful.   This was an attempt to discredit my son's and some students' recollection of the incident. They even went so far as to blame my son for their lack of communication.I was informed that my son's family could not see the alleged video due to a school policy. They offered to edit the video so we could watch. The day before this meeting, the Regional Director, Dr. ### ### advised me that the video had been deleted.The next day I went to the gym with my son and found no evidence of security cameras. I recorded what I saw, and have not had any contact with Leadership since ###To summarize my issue is that the school did not inform me that my son hit his head and was ### after the fall. The school neglected to follow school injury policies. The school and The Regional Manager lied several times about having a video in their possession. Eagle Fox Park based their argument from a video that ever existed. There was an attempt to contradict my son as well as to absolve Eagle Fox Park of any responsibility. At this point we are demanding the following: Acknowledgment of the school's negligence and dishonesty, given by Eagle Fox Park, ### ### and the School Board.A written formal apology from Eagle Fox Park, Dr. ### ### and School Board, as well as a public apology for their attempt to deceit his family about their possession of a video.A required All-Staff Training to teach staff the correct way to handle an injury on school campus.A meeting with all involved parties between Eagle College Prep's Legal Team and the Family's Attorneys.Implement a school policy to hold schools accountable for not following school policies and procedures.The end of school staff ### students by threatening to review cameras when in fact there are no cameras in the specific area.A conversation with Eagle College ### School Board and my son's family.44505.0534722222 Because under ###, the school is required to provide ###. They are also are required to provide accommodations to allow him equal access to all programs. The school board and director of special education did not provide him any accommodations. Prior to this all students were to be ###, all they did is remove the ### requirement. The principle measured to see what could be done but nothing she offered would be put into his IEP because it was not supported by the school district.  Accommodations are written into the IEP, they are not good faith promises. They were also going to exclude him from activities that his non-disabled peers are able to do. Excluding him and not providing accommodations is discrimination. He is now doing virtual, but that is not the least restrictive environment. He has also not been receiving his required services. The school district has a responsibility to make sure that he is in as safe of an environment as they can, they are not doing that. They are knowingly allowing him to be exposed to a deadly and debilitating disease. This is not a political issue, this is a health issue and should be treated as such. Every organization that studies diseases states that all individuals, vaccinated or not, should be ###ed while in doors. The school is getting federal funds and they have the legal obligation to accommodate my son and other children that are immunocompromised. 44534.0729166667 I'm not clear why you think the school might be discriminating.  It appears they've been able to accommodate your son in the classroom, but not the music and art rooms.  I would suspect that the problem with PE is that it's difficult to control children on a playground.  Maybe they gave you a different reason.  Did they give you a reason why they couldn't accommodate in the music and art rooms?  Could it be because those rooms are smaller?  Is your plan to go virtual, or is that just a temporary plan?  You stated that there are ### ###.  Are the other two due to disabilities also?  Based on what you've stated, it doesn't appear that they are discriminating.  It looks like they've tried to accommodate your son the best they could under their limited space.  I could be wrong.  Why do you think this could be discrimination?44534.0131944444 My son has disabilities. He goes to Blue Springs public schools. On ###th, we received an email stating they were no longer requiring ###.  On ###rd, we had an IEP meeting that included the Director of Special Education. We found out out of a class of ###, ###. My son's doctor wrote a letter to the school district stating due to my son's health issues, those within ###. The director offered the accommodation" of ###. She also stated that any agreements we came to in order to attempt at keeping my son safe could not be included in the IEP. After much conversation the principle stated she would measure and see what could be done to provide the ###. She later called and said they could have ### APE and library but they would not be able to accommodate him in music art or PE. She stated while they could not require staff to wear ### around him the teachers did say they would wear ### around him but they could not enforce this or guarantee substitutes would wear ### around him.  My son has not been in school since ###th and we are now waiting to find out when he will be able to start virtual. We will reassess the situation for next semester once he is able to be fully vaccinated. I feel the school district is violating my son's civil rights by not providing him a safe learning environment in the least restrictive environment. What can we do to make sure he is not being discriminated against? Thank you."44528.2229166667 You've done your homework.  You're aware that the U.S. Department of Education enforces Section ###.  This includes public schools.  The Office for Civil Rights (###) receive a lot of complaints regarding Section ###.  They also enforce Section ###.  Based on what you said, the school could be deemed not in compliance.  There would likely be a hearing.  According to the law, you have a legitimate complaint.  As a result, if they are deemed not in compliance, there could be enforcement action, such as the loss of funding.  I would contact the Office for Civil Rights.  Their number is 800-###.  Email: ###.  Hopefully you can get the ball rolling and your son can receive the accommodations he's entitled to under the law.44534.7326388889 ###,Let me address your last messages in parts:Because you are seeking compensatory damages above $5,000, small claims court is not an option. Thus, I would strongly suggest retaining an attorney before you do anything else. Educational cases like yours are complicated, and litigating without representation in Missouri is discouraged by Missouri courts.I am not entirely sure you have a case (which is why you need to retain counsel). Educational malpractice is not a cause of action in Missouri. While some courts have accepted educational malpractice claims disguised as violations of the consumer protection act, that is not a guaranteed outcome.Winkler did not receive over $500,###. Ms. Winkler sued, asking for over $550,000. ###, probably due to an internal mistake, failed to respond. The court entered a default judgment against ###, for failing to answer the complaint. The court awarded Ms. Winkler $###,000. Later, ### appeared, and filed motions to dismiss the complaint and to set aside the default judgment. The parties started negotiations and settled the case. It is unclear how much money Ms. Winkler received, but Iâ€™d be surprised if she received more than $10,000. After the parties communicated to the court they were settling the case, the court granted ###â€™s motion to set aside the default judgment (meaning the $###,###).I read ###â€™s motion to set aside and it invokes a ton of precedent on how Missouri courts should not entertain actions for educational malpractice. This is the main reason you need to retain a specialized attorney for this.What you can do right away, even before retaining an attorney, is filing a â€œBorrower Defense to Repayment Applicationâ€ with the U.S. Department of Education (https://studentaid.gov/borrower-defense/). These are basically requests for loan forgiveness for not getting what you paid for from the college.While I cannot make an attorney recommendation because I am not in the St. ### area, below are the names/contact info that resulted from my search for higher education attorneys in St. ###:### ###Law firm: TGH Litigation LLC (https://www.tghlitigation.com/areas-of-practice)Email: ###Phone: ###Address: ###, ###, MO ###Comments: I know this is not in St. ###, but they are specialized in ### in educational institutions.

The collegeâ€™s unfair treatment may have caused emotional distress and may have hindered your education, but courts are hesitant to entertain actions such as these.I understand you want to sue them because you were treated unfairly, and you believe (and I agree) you need to be compensated for it.

I have attached the description letter to this reply. I first contacted an attorney that was representing a classmate of mine that in mention in the description letter. He blew me off for a while and I just started contacting other attorney. This particular attorney won in the civil case against ###. I met him at his office and all he wanted was for me to record a conversation between myself and my college advisor. I emailed him and asked if it was a conflict of interest, but never got a response. I have a ton of evidence, but I never get to really sit down and talk to an attorney and show them what I have. I tried for almost ###-###. I finally spoke with an attorney earlier this year that advised me to file a complaint with the Federal Department of Education. I filed my complaint months ago and they just responded this month. A lot of time has been wasted and I'm just not sure what to do. My classmate that I spoke of went through the same things that I did, but I went through even more after they kicked out of the program. They would change my test scores several times in one day. I had to file appeals for everything. I would go threw the chain of commands for the appeals process and would never get approved. The first step is the ### of students. She would always deny my appeals. Next, it was the appeals council. I would sit down with them and they always denied my appeals. I would contact the President of the school and she would override their decision. The ###% of the ### American students that would file an appeal would get denied. ### Winkler (my classmate that won her civil suit) told me that they were going to try to kick me out of the program next. They did the same things to me as they did to her. ### and I would tell the staff that we would call the nursing board and inform them about the way that we were treated. They retaliated against us by changing our test scores to failing grades. I have a ton of emails and appeal documentation. I just need to file the civil suit myself or find an attorney that is willing to represent me. ### is known for discriminations and retaliating against students that go outside of the chain of command. The majority of the students just take the punishment and never speak about their experiences. They can not continue to retaliate against students and denying the appeals of ### American students. Some advice would be greatly appreciated.44539.2923611111 Hi ###,My name is Bernardo and I will do my best to help you. Before I can do that, however, can you tell me about why you are thinking of suing your college? I want to understand the case, so I can properly advise you on whether it is wise, or not, to sue pro se (without an attorney). Pro se litigation can be very complicated and Missouri courts strongly disfavor it.Please give me details of your claims, and a timeline of events so I can properly analyze your situation.Regards,Bernardo44539.2645833333 I forgot to tell you that yes, I am in debt.

Will this effect his/her rights when minor turns ###/purchasing firearms? 44263.1333333333 My daughter was recently in a fight at her school in ###, County where she was suspended to the board for striking a teacher. The fight was started when another child bumped into my daughters friend. This resulted in three young ladies assaulting my daughter (jumping her).and two young ladies assaulting her friend. This is the only altercation my daughter has been involved in since school began. However, my daughter was suspended the previous year for striking a teacher. I requested to view the video of this years fight and it does not show that my daughter struck a teacher. I also explained to the principal the cause of the fight while viewing the video, which she saw and said she would add to the file. During my daughter's iep meeting statements were read. not one teacher stated she hit them only the assistant principal.I have two questions, first should the iep meeting have come to a conclusion without accurate information? Second, should my daughter still have to face disciplinary action (go to the board instead of just being suspended) if she did not actually strike" a teacher a category ###?  What should I do from here?"43228.8284722222 I just completed my first semester of nursing school begining of August and am in the process of submitting an appeal for my final grade. The school policy states in cases where students alleges that a final course grade was unjustifed the student first attempts to resolve the conflct with the instructor by initiating the appeal process in writing no later than ###." I read over the program policy and student handbook to look up any policies that may support my appeal. The program offers an academic remediation policy which includes a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). In the student handbook it states "PIP will be initiated automatically when the cumulative course exam grade average falls below 75%. This plan allows me to meet with my instructor develop academic plan for improvement follow up with instructor after each exam and the PIP remains open until the student has achieved and maintained an exam course average of greater than 75%. There is even an PIP form that is filled out in detail and the student and instructor or faculty signs together. That process never was initiated to me by my intructor and I do not believe the school took the necessary actions according to what was stated in their handbook prior to me failing the course. The program has a student success and retention specialist who usually handles remediation planning but she was on maternity leave this summer. Therefore my instructor informed us at the beginning of the semester that she was temporarily taking over her role as well. We had a total of ###. I have met with my intructor after taking exam ### the remediation policy was never brought up to me. I also had a sick doctor's note to excuse me from one of the exam dates but I was worried my intructor would not accept rescheduling exams so I showed up and it resulted in me receiving a poor grade.

This month I witnessed ### being left in her Math classroom unattended by her aide and the special educator after ### worked on her IEP goal lesson. There was no other activities for her. ### was wheeled to the front of the room and given a Goldfish cracker. Her aide then began to walk the room assisting other students. When ### would scream another Goldfish cracker was given to her. Other students would stare at her. I was informed that her aide has been instructed to do this. She has stood up for ### stating that this isn't right and they wouldn't allow her to do her job. ### frequent breaks have stopped. ### was also placed in her ### in physical education. We expressed our concerns about that. We sent an email requesting that ### not be left alone, it's in her IEP. It is for her safety. We also asked for her not to be placed in a ### in gym. They continued to do these after our email. ### is in her wheelchair all day. She gets frequent breaks. Her aide was taking her out to stretch when she was overwhelmed and needed a break. She was instructed to stop. Nothing that we wanted was honestly resolved yesterday. We just said thanks so we could review the new IEP and start to appeal and seek help. They continued the meeting without us and made decisions without us. In the meeting there were three activities that ### works on for her IEP. Three activities that only take a few minutes to work on. The science one was just created. She realistically has two activities to complete. They admitted that they have nothing in place for her. ### is not being stimulated and is shutting down. Her educational goals being eliminated to allow her aide to help other students. They now want to take away her communication log and have someone babysit her aide at pick up and dismissal. Her aide has resigned to protect herself. ### had made do much progress with her. They want someone there who will allow this isolation to continue. I have substituted in several of ### classes. The special educator has not modified work and has left no medications for her. She sits and will sleep or is awake and given a treat, snacks that we send in to be quiet. We don't treat others this way! It's in humane and she has no dignity! She's being treated like an animal.The principal is even belittling her.

The ### sent a letter detailing reasoning for the denial, including multiple reasons either not applicable or in direct contradiction to ### guidelines. For example, ### states that prior high academic achievement is not reason enough to deny accommodation, but ### cited my graduating high school and obtaining my degree as a reason. If that was enough surely there would be no reason to offer accommodation. I took the exam in standard conditions and received a low failing score, after being unable to complete the exam in the time allotted. ### then sent me a letter regarding my ###" score and demanding an explanation as to why or be in ### to sit exams again. They wanted proof that I wasn't simply viewing questions to leak or use for cheating.At that point I had already applied for and payed for the next exam needed. I responded to ### with the documentation of my accommodations request and a statement about not being able to finish the exam and thus not even viewing all the questions. I also told them I paid for my exam and prep materials with Unemployment money so I really didn't have the time or funds to be taking tests for any nefarious reasons. That was deemed sufficient explanation for them.I must take the current exam I am registered for by ###th. I would like to request accommodations again but am unsure about how to proceed.

However, if you retain counsel to represent you and your son the expense will be significant.  I don't know the current hourly rates for attorneys in ### County, but statewide, the median hourly rate for attorneys is $300, according to the most recent data I have seen.  You must also be aware that the vice principal may not have relied upon only your son's confession in making the determination.  There could have been other evidence, including the statement of the person making the complaint;  a victim's statement, if different from the person making the complaint; disinterested ### could have been interviewed.  There could have been context which made the principal believe that there was more or less present to the circumstances that made one version of the description more believable than another.  This is not the kind of case that will yield a court appointed attorney for you or your son and it's also not the kind of case for which attorneys will work on a contingency basis, so you will likely need to hire counsel if you wish to contest the matter using an attorney.You should contact the local school board to determine your school district's local rules for the appeal of the suspension.  Those rules are initially left, generally, to the school board.Lastly, you should remember, if this case reminds you of the case invovling ### Dassey, his confession was ultimately determined to be admissible and his conviction was upheld.  A family member of Mr. Dassey was also convicted.  You may wish to refrain from making a comparison which would be unfavorable to you and your family if you pursue this matter through administrative appeals or later through court.  Good luck.44481.4333333333 I received a phone call from ### Middle School in ### Springs on Thursday of last week. The administrator I spoke with claims my son called another student a lesbian. My sons punishment was ###. When my son returned home from school Thursday afternoon he told me the facts as he knows it... he stated that he never called another student a name and that when he was trying to explain his side of the story that the Assistant Principal wouldn't let him speak, he interrupted him, told him he was lying, made him feel intimidated and in return my son admitted guilt to something he did not do. I would like to know if I have a case that would be ### in court. I believe the Assistant Principal used intimidation and coercion to get my son to admit to something he did not do. It reminds me of the case involving ### Dassey. 44481.0354166667 What is the best way to approach this case? I have already contacted an attorney that wouldn't take it, making me think that they don't think it's a case worth taking. There was a text that my daughter wrote in a group chat where the kids were laughing about a meme and she used a slang ### when commenting about it. Other students also used the same word repeatedly in the same context throughout the chat. Someone took a screenshot and said they were offended by her only. They then used this to make up a disgusting lie saying she called a girl a racial slur. Now she is being bullied and harassed because they spread the rumor even though those same students reporting it told the principal no one heard her say it. Despite me telling him that it was all made up and students continue to harass her, he refuses to discipline or even speak to them about anything. He sent me an email with an arrogant tone saying he questions my motives and he won't allow me to say hurtful things about his students. I merely presented the evidence and explained everything that has been happening. She is being defamed and the only one being held accountable for anything despite doing nothing wrong. She was the only one who he spoke to asking her if she knew what she did wrong and that he could've made it worse for her". She was never given a chance to speak up and say what actually happened and defend herself. The ###' story was believed without question and my daughter was the only one disciplined at that point. He refuses to do anything to keep from making this an uncomfortable environment for her but claims she never said anyone has been bullying her even after I gave him examples in my email. After I got no answer I emailed him again and he wrote back saying a bunch of false and accusatory things. He claimed he didn't deem it necessary to reply! The email I sent clearly told him she was being harassed and bullied but he ignored that and made everything about race while trying to say I'm the one that did so. School has now become a hostile and uncomfortable environment for my daughter when she did nothing wrong and her principal refuses to help. Instead he has made it worse. Just yesterday someone said something racist about her in front of her; something she's being accused of which she did not do. The principal also continues to say my daughter did something she didn't do as if it's a fact even though he has no proof because it never happened. I'm going to have to take her out of that school and she will lose the opportunity to graduate with an associate's degree and certified as a dispatcher. She has suffered emotional distress and losing career opportunities over this. "44496.8694444444 A few days ago while playing ### says in the aftercare program at school my ###, it was not out of anger and was done after â€œ### said slap the person you hateâ€ my daughter hit the girl was disciplined at school by being suspended for ###, apologized and explained that she did not actually hate the girl she was just playing the game, explained and the school allowed her to return the following day. The day she returned during the aftercare program at her school my daughter was accused of sitting on the little girl, the teacher asked my daughter who said that she did not sit on the little girl and was told to stay away from the child going forward which she did. The teacher immediately notified the other childâ€™s mother but did not notify myself of the incident until after the other parent decided that she now wanted to press charges on my daughter. That evening the police showed up to my door and basically forced me into putting my daughter into a teen program or else they would need to issue something like a warrant for her since she decided to press charges. This all just does not seem legal to me. my daughter has never been violent and did not strike the girl out of anger only while playing a game. How is It that the police can immediately force my daughter to do a teen program at ###. She is scared with the whole situation and I feel that the other parent never even wanted to sit down with myself or the school to discuss the situation. I in someway feel that they are targeting my daughter and the the police is going to somehow make my child into a criminal. I would like to know what I should do to help my daughter get out of the situation with as little effect on her emotional and criminal  well-being.44497.3375 You are only permitted to ask civil law questions here, not criminal. 44497.5854166667 HiNot to long ago I went to a f###t party and d###nk a glass of punch.

My friends and I took a ### home, and getting out of the car I told my friends I needed help and was not feeling well. Just then a ### saw me and called 911. I ended up going to the hospital. But few days later, instead of the school supporting me I got punished for it. The ### did not want to hear about someone putting something in the punch. Basically they said I was intoxicated which was not the case. I thought atleast I would get medical amnesty. Apparently, this is a common thing that happens to the girls and the admin ignores it. I have spoken to tons of girls and the boys get away with drinking and drugs, while the girls are punished for this. I want to appeal this but not sure if I can. 44504.6958333333 My child is ### 2018. The court is asking me as the parent to show cause and to contact an attorney.

I am currently in a complicated situation with college administrators and college student leaders of ### College. The college administrators I am to meet have exhibited bias against me and have encroached on my right to due process. Upon informing them of their encroachment, this college administrator and their supervisor have requested a meeting with me, however, I am uncomfortable meeting with them as they have exhibited bias. I requested to have my domestic partner present at the meeting, but they responded that they will only meet with current students of the college. They have instead advised me to come with a person who is a current student, and write down my grievances in case I forget. Is my domestic partner allowed to accompany me to a meeting with these college administrators? Are they allowed to deny my request to be accompanied by my domestic partner? I would also like to know if it is legal for them to advise me to only be accompanied by a friend who is a current student? Am I allowed to bring a legal advisor instead of my domestic partner or friend, as they have not presented me with this option?I would also like to know if you would be able to recommend me a lawyer that could assist me with my situation at a low cost?

If you do not have these, ask the college administration for them.  These may explain what your rights are and who is permitted to accompany you.   CUNY is a New York City university - a branch of New York City government and it may have its own rules and regulations particularly with regard to due process.    You mentioned that the administrators have exhibited bias towards you.  You may want to write down all of the details - what, when, who where, and how.  What type of bias is it?  What was the damage or harm?  For instance, did you get a low grade in a class?       Regarding representation - have you thought of contacting the American Civil Liberties Union?  Also, please look at this website: https:/https://www1.###.gov/site/cchr/enforcement/complaint-process.pagewww1.###.gov/site/cchr/enforcement/complaint-process.page  which is the website for the ### Commission on Human Rights.  Lastly, you may want to contact the New York City Bar Association to ask if an attorney would represent you pro bono" - for free.  I hope that this helps you and I wish you lots of good luck in the future.  Most importantly please don't let a bad experience stop you from getting a good education so that you can be successful in the future.All the best### ### Esq."43228.8208333333 Hello, I am a ###, anxiety, and I have ADD. I am currently enrolled in what should be my last two semesters of my associates degree. I have an issues where I have been having problems with software for one of my classes, and the professor and the college is aware that I have accomodations.

I can not help my learnign disabilty it is something that I have had for my whole life. This situation also casues my anxiety to sky rocket and I don't want that happen. I am not sure if this is a violation of the ### or not, but I always feel like I am getting worked up when I have to talk to her. There has also been situations where I have asked her for help and she would not help me. She said she was to busy and that I should get a tutor. The tutors were only avaiable for first year students until about ###/###.

Is it still the case that you design a degree program with your mentor, and then submit it for approval to the main campus in ### Springs?43252.8041666667 I'm a student at ESC (### State College) I found out in the last month that my required mentor approved the wrong courses for my degree, which resulted in me taking two semesters of courses I didn't need to take ( I needed her approval for all of my courses, and they were reviewed with her.) She was well aware of my degree goal, and that I was on a limited timeline as I was pregnant while I was going to school.  I had been told repeatedly, once I was pregnant, that I only needed one more semester where I just needed to do my PLAs (Prior Learning Assessments), and that if they were approved I would graduate with a bachelor's in Educational Studies (Concentration in Workforce Development).  After my second semester, my mentor stopped answering me altogether. After a few months of not being able to reach her, I requested a new mentor. My new mentor went through all of my academic history with ESC  and found that I hadn't taken any of the required things I needed to graduate. I essentially wasted a year of time, two semesters worth of money, and now have a ###.  The school has already admitted their wrongdoing and is currently trying to offer me informal" ### to the problem.  One of the offers was for them to pay for the last semester I have and my PLAs but there's no guarantee of what will happen or if I can pass the ###'re now saying I need. I'm wondering if I have legal grounds to sue the school or mentor over this situation.Attached is the grievance email thread I have going with the school currently within there is the thread of emails between myself and the original mentor that caused all of this. "43252.6638888889 I'm wondering if I have legal grounds to sue the school or mentor over this situation." Unless ESC breached a contract with you; or were negligent in advising you and that as a result of either this breach or negligence you sustained a ### monetary damage then I'm of the opinion that you not have a viable cause of action.If the school is willing to refund your tuition for the time it took you to complete these ### courses and other associated costs (e.g. textbooks) then they have at least made you whole as far as your out of pocket costs.Of course your time has value. I presume that you want to continue working towards a bachelor's in Educational Studies (Concentration in Workforce Development). What if anything is the school willing to do to facilitate this goal given your current circumstances."43252.8784722222 It sounds as if the school is making a good faith effort to rectify this situation. I don't know what your tuition is, but the cost of bringing a lawsuit would most likely exceed what it cost you for two semesters.43252.8944444444 So would that mean I do have a viable cause of action? They were negligent in advising me, which turned into two semesters worth of money down the drain.  In my communications on the phone with Dr. ### ###, she told me to submit the grievance requesting they refund both semesters.  She then reached out informally through her assistant (via email) and instead offered to cover the cost of the 11-credit advanced semester and the PLAs.  43252.8833333333 Yes, The ### of undergrads ### ### admitted to that already. She said I had grounds to go through the formal grievance process and request a refund for both semesters.Second question, same answer-- ### ###And to an extent, I'd say that ESC is structured to adult ### in all walks of life.  I worked a full-time job while I did the first two semesters at ESC.  However, I have no space in my life to complete ###-time job, and a ###.  Advanced level courses have a higher workload, and require additional study time. It would be unrealistic for me to say I'd be able to dedicate enough time to pass those type of courses while my daughter is this young. 43252.8416666667 You got it! They still need to approve everything, go over your class registration etc.  She essentially approved a bunch of courses that didn't benefit me at all, and a degree I apparently wasn't really supposed to get through there. The biggest problem is just that my circumstances have dramatically changed-- I didn't have a baby those two semesters.  Had she actually had me take the courses I needed to, I would just need to do the PLAs at this point but that's not the case either.  They're saying now that I need to take ### ###'ll be possible with a baby and full time job. Not only that, but the PLAs were apparently supposed to be done in my finalizing the degree course" but we didn't do that (even though I passed her course with an A). She was recommending I do them with her in an indep study over the summer instead. "43252.8194444444 You wrote :She essentially approved a bunch of courses that didn't benefit me at all and a degree I apparently wasn't really supposed to get through there. "Did someone within the college administration actually admit to that?You wrote" "They're saying now that I need to take ### ### . . ."Who are they?

That hearing would argue that the school district violated these statutes by (###) illegally discriminating against your son, based on perceptions concerning people with disabilities (i.e., that because his mother has a mental health condition, your son likely does as well and is, therefore, dangerous); (###) refusing to allow your son to return to school unless you had him evaluated at your own expense, although the district suspected he may be a student with disabilities and, therefore, it was required to arrange for his evaluation under its child find obligation (existing under both IDEA and Section 50###); (###) failing to comply with its child find obligation by requesting your consent to evaluate your son and then completing the evaluation and preparing an education plan within ###; (###) failing to provide a manifestation review to your son before suspending him for more than ### (or, at least, suspending him indefinitely until you had him evaluated); failing to provide you with notice of your due process rights under IDEA; inter alia. If you have already pursued a complaint with the USDOE ### and it was denied, you may only have the right to an impartial hearing under these statutes left.  If you want to pursue this option, you would prepare and send to the school district a demand for a due process hearing under IDEA and one for a hearing under Section 50###.  SED has a template form for such complaint at http://www.p######.nysed.gov/specialed/formsnotices/dueprocesscomplaint/notice#########.htm. Get a hold of the District's policies for a hearing under Section ###.  (See https://www.delhischools.org/common/pages/DisplayFile.aspx?itemId=5######059###)  I think your best bet is to try and find an attorney who is experienced in special education law to represent you and your son in filing such a complaint and handling any ensuing hearing.  Some local legal aid organizations will provide free representation in this regard for parents in such matters and there are firms that specialize in the representation of parents in such matters.  I would start there (i.e., looking for a legal aid organization or law firm to represent you in the matter). There is a two-year period of limitation regarding such matters, and you are well within that period. 43291.8625 I've has since pulled my son for the district and he now attends a different school.  I have done my best to work with the school since the decisions by the State. Ed. was made. And, yes the state did say it could not decided IDEA and ###. Law 3214. I have made several request with the school to conduct a proper investigation according to the districts written policy when parents allege discrimination. I discovered this procedure after the State Ed. made its decision. The school has yet to respond and it's been nearly ###. I may just petition the State Ed. again and ask that the district comp my with its own policy pertaining to discrimination. The policy states that when a parent, teacher, student believes they were discriminated against then the districts Compliance Officer should investigate. I began to protest the treatment of my son immediately and never got passed the superintendent level. I was never informed of the districts policy. When I wrote to the BOE to express my concerns they had the school attorney investigate and later the same firm she works for represented the school in court. The district policy says that the Compliance Officer (he works at the school and not for a law firm) and the investigation would be done without bias. I strongly believe that the district violated this policy and the investigation was done with bias as the same law firm that did the investigation at the district level then represented the district in court at the State Ed..I'm am simply not impressed that the district, in my opinion,  has so far gotten away with horribly treating my son. It was unbearable for him to attend the school after this as he felt that the school simply did not care for or about him. Sad.43294.5770833333 Mr. Gray,The facts you stated in your post raise two issues: (###) it appears the School District violated Section ### ###97### ###.S.C. Â§ ###) (Section ###") based on a perception that he is a student with disabilities; and (###) it appears to have violated Education Law ###; and (###) the School District may have violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (###.S.C. ### et seq.) ("IDEA") and Section ### (provided you first consent). I will address these issues in order.First you state that the Principal told you that the Principal believed your son is likely to suffer from mental illness because his mother was diagnosed as bipolar. That statement indicates that the Principal considered your son to have a mental condition that would substantially impair a major life activity.  Therefore your son was arguably protected by Section ###'s prohibition against unwarranted disability discrimination. Section ###. Relative to schools it is enforced by the U. S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights and the Department's regulations can be found at ###.F.R. Part ###04.  Section ### and a student can be awarded money damages injunctive relief and attorneys' fees if a school district is found to have illegally discriminated against the student based on the student's actual or perceived disability. K.M. v. ### Park Cent. School Dist. ###. Supp. TERM00065### ###4### ###57-###58 (S.D.N.Y. ###005).  IDEA provides that a student is a student with disabilities if he/she is deemed to have a disability within one of ###.  Under Section ### an individual is considered disabled if he/she (###) has a physical or mental condition that substantially ### a major life activity; (###) has a history of such an impairment (i.e. had such an impairment once but no longer does); or (###) is regarded as having such an impairment.  The Principal's comment strongly indicates that he/she believed your son to have a mental condition that impaired a major life activity which brought your son into the class of persons protected by Section ###.  Therefore the School District was prohibited from discriminating against her son based on the perceived disability. Under the USDOE regulations under Section ### once the Principal suspected your son may be a student with disabilities the School District was required to ask that you consent to the District evaluating him at its expense to determine if he wan evaluation of your son to determine if he has a disability of the type covered by IDEA and/or as defined by Section ###.  If you provided such consent the District needed to complete its evaluation and if necessary develop an education plan that specified the program and services your son would receive to obtain an appropriate (or meaningful) education within ###.  If you refused to consent to your son's evaluation the School District could either have let the matter drop and considered your son a nondisabled student or pursued an administrative hearing seeking authorization to conduct the hearing without parental consent.  If an evaluation indicated your son has a disability the School District had to develop his education plan and then seek your consent to provide special education and/or related services.  However if you had refused to consent to your son receiving such services the District would have had no recourse and it would have had to consider your son a nondisabled student.   The School District may have violated both IDEA and Section ###.  Its requirement that you have someone else conduct that evaluation - apparently at your expense - and conditioning his right to return to school on you complying with that requirement also violated IDEA Section ### ###.S.C. ###98### (which provides monetary compensation injunctive relief and attorneys' fees for violations of a person's constitutional rights).  In addition under both IDEA and Section ### if your son was found to be a student with disabilities the School District would have been prohibited from imposing an out-of-school suspension exceeding ###.  That review is conducted by a committee composed of people familiar with his condition and him which must determine if the offending conduct was substantially related to his disability.  If so the School District could not legally impose the suspension exceeding ###.  Instead it had to develop a behavioral improvement plan to minimize the likelihood of such conduct in the future. School districts are required by IDEA and Section ### or likely has a disability although the student has not been evaluated.  Arguably given the Principal's comment to you about the likelihood he has a mental condition the manifestation review was required.  In addition to those issues the School District likely violated Education Law ###-of-school suspension without first having provided you with ### and written notice that the Principal was considering suspending your son and that you had a right to an informal conference with the Principal about whether the suspension was appropriate during which you could question witnesses and present your son's side of the story.  While a suspension can be imposed in advance of such notice and conference when a student's conduct indicates that there is a substantial likelihood that the student's presence in the school will endanger others or cause a substantial disruption of the educational process the ### notice must be given right away and the written notice must be provided by means that are calculated to be delivered within ### and the parent-Principal conference must occur as soon as possible.  Also bear in mind that a building principal can only impose a suspension of up to five school days. If the School District believed your son's conduct warranted an out-of-school suspension exceeding five school days it had to provide you and your son with a Superintendent's hearing during which you and your son could address evidence presented by the District present witnesses or other evidence be heard regarding penalty and at which you could be represented by counsel or someone else.  In addition the District was required to make an audio recording of the hearing (which it must provide you on request) and you had the right to appeal the Superintendent's decision following the hearing to the Board of Education.  You were entitled to written notice of the date and time of such a hearing the charges against your son and the alleged surrounding facts and of all of your rights under Education Law ###.  Education Law Â§ ###.  If the School District suspected that your son had a disability that made his placement in a general education environment dangerous to himself or others it was required to ask you to consent to your son being evaluated at the District's expense to determine if he had such a disability and if so make available all programs and services necessary for him to receive an appropriate education.  Its failure to do so likely violates IDEA Section ### ### ### #########4.  The School District had no authority to keep your son out of school indefinitely unless and until you had him evaluated -- an evaluation that you had a right to refuse.  Attempting to enforce an indefinite suspension was also a blatant violation of Education Law Â§ #########4 which only permits a school district to impose a penalty reasonably related to an offense of which the student has been found guilty at a fair hearing. Clearly the School District went well beyond this restriction.You may seek to have an administrative hearing regarding these violations of IDEA and Section ###.  Section ###.  I believe you will need an attorney to help you undertake such an effort and I recommend that you check with your local bar association to determine if there are legal aid services available to parents of students with disabilities or if you qualify parents of limited means. Section ###'s fees and some attorneys will therefore take a case on a contingency basis.You may also wish to ask the School District to provide you with a copy of its policies for a due process hearing under Section ###. Doing so would at least put them on notice that you know there is a significant issue in this regard and prompt the administrators to correct the matter."43289.8270833333 My first coarse of action was to file with the US Dept. Ed. Civil Rights. My complaint was dismissed due to it being over the ###. I did my own research and determined that there may have been educational civil rights violations. However, I concluded that about five months after the occurrence. When the US Dept. of Ed. diamissed my complaint I then contacted the school and filed a complaint with the BOE. From their response of no wrong doing I then files with the State Ed. I am confused that the State decision says I have not exhausted all options to file against the school. The only other option I came across was a State Ed. Dept. office that handles civil rights complaints and, maybe, special ed. grievances. It's odd to me in that the State Ed. decision said they could not decide civil rights as they are Federal regulations. 43291.8381944444 My son alleged a teacher at his school called him names. Names like loser" and "the worst kid in the world". My son did not want to go to school after this. He was ###. When I addressed this with the school principal she stated that due to my son's mothers bi polar diagnosis my son has a 50% increase of developing a mental illness due to hereditary factors. My son told school officials what names he was called by a teacher and also disclosed he had a dream where he found the "bully" teacher shot dead. My son was then labeled by the principal to be with "homicidal mania" and suspended my son. My son was not "written up" nor was I given any notice of suspension. The deal I was forced to take was I had to have my son evaluated to see if he was mentally sound to return to school. If I did not agree my son was to be banned from school with no education offered and I was to be reported to authorities for "medical neglect". I want to know if the school should have sent my son to their special education department as the school was the one to believe my son disabled enough that it impeded his education. Can schools tell parents that their children are banned and offered no educational services while the child is banned from the school building? The school also has no documentation of this situation at all. The only documents I have are ones I received are from the police/cps who the school called.I did file without success with the ### Dept. Of Education. My petition was denied as my words apparently were" rambling" and I allegedly was not clear as what my claim was.  I received notice about two months ago my case was dismissed.  I don't believe the State Ed. Dept. made the right decision."43270.5402777778 Thank your for your response. Your response is how I expect the State Ed. Dept. would respond to my petitions. I have no legal education but did my own research and felt confident enough to file my petition. However,  ### Ed. Dept. dismissed my petition and my request to reopen the case. Again, thank you and enjoy your summer.                                                                                                 ### Gray                                                                                                 Delhi, New York43290.9597222222 Very welcome.  Sometimes they can be a bit unforgiving if a petition or memorandum of law is not on the money or meanders a bit.  However, your options under Section ###, regardless of what the Commissioner of Education did.  Also, there is the judicial action that you could bring for disability discrimination.  One additional option I did not mention in my last post was to file a complaint with the U.S. Dep't of Education, Office for Civil Rights.  You can file a complaint with the ### online. (https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/###/docs/howto.html).  Sometimes it seems a little deferential to the State Education Dep't, but not always.  They have very competent and well-paid attorneys with not enough to do.  So, it can be a useful option too.  You would have to pharase the complaint as one for disability discrimination in violation of Section ###, however, so they don't decide it's something that should be pursued under IDEA's administrative process and punt.  I think you will find them easier to work wtih, compared to SED. 43291.0458333333 He was transfer out of Hempstead high school because he was choked by another student and I file a complaint ### the school security guard stood right there and didnâ€™t help my son why being ### he was struggling with the school work so they place him in a inappropriate detain school with kids that have mental and behavioral problems and itâ€™s delaying my son education .

If that is true, you can likely file a successful appeal with the school, as required by its student disciplinary policies (i.e., the policies stated in the Student Handbook). The process your school had to provide depends on whether it is a public or private school. Post-secondary schools that are operated by the State (e.g., SUNY) or a political subdivision of the State (e.g., county community college) must provide the essentials of due process, which must include an opportunity for the student to assert a defense to the alleged misconduct. Private schools, however, have a lesser obligation, but, generally, must provide some opportunity for the student to present his or her side of the story. A private school must follow its student discipline policies and provide a student with the procedure stated in its student discipline policy, which is generally described in its student handbook. A court will generally defer to a private school's determination in a student disciplinary case, unless it is demonstrated that the private school failed to follow its student discipline policies .A public school, by contrast, must have policies that provide students with a hearing in which students can provide information in their defense and it must demonstrate that it followed this process. Again, courts are generally deferential to the school's determination, but if it is demonstrated that the student was not provided an effective opportunity to defend himself or herself, a court will require the school to provide an appropriate process or, in extraordinary cases, vacate the school's disciplinary action and require the student's reinstatement.Before a court considers the matter, you must complete the process provided by your school, which will include an appeal process. It is imperative that you file a timely appeal of the disciplinary decision. Failure to do so will likely preclude any court review of your case. Therefore, you should immediately review your student handbook and determine what is required to file an appeal (e.g., what documents/statements are required and the deadline) and make every effort to comply with it. In terms of what the basis for your appeal may be, it depends on the facts of your case, but I point out the following. First, make sure you understand the basis for the expulsion decision. You indicated in your post that the penalty of expulsion was based on your erroneous sharing of a patient photograph. However, you do not address whether it was appropriate for you to even possess such a photograph in the first place. Generally, medical facilities and schools restrict the circumstances in which patients may be ### or in which their photographs may be possessed or distributed. This policy will be informed by the HIPPA privacy rule. It is unclear to me why you had a patient photograph on your computer that you could post in the chat application, and I suspect that part of the discipline imposed in your case is based on an assertion that you improperly took or possessed that photograph. You should carefully review the notice you received about the school's determination in your case and determine whether such a charge was part of the analysis. Assuming that it is â€“ and I would be surprised if it is not â€“ your appeal must address why it was excusable for you to have taken and/or possessed the photograph in the first place. The next issue you must address is your error in posting the picture. If it was simply a mistake and you had the picture for some legitimate or excusable reason, your error is probably understandable. The next issue you should address is your misrepresentation about what happened when you were first asked. The integrity violation is significant because it is imperative that medical professionals and ### maintain absolute integrity relative to patient care and issues related to patient care. So, it will be important that you explain why you misrepresented what you had done. As I understand it, you panicked in the shock of first realizing what you had done and, when you had regained your composure, you voluntarily came forward to correct the record. If those are the facts, state them and emphasize you voluntarily came forward. However, if you admitted what had actually happened after the school told you that it had evidence that contradicted your denial, be honest about that fact. Trying to mischaracterize it will only complicate your appeal. If the school failed to provide you with the process described in the Student Handbook (e.g., a hearing, an opportunity to present statements or other information in your defense, etc.), emphasize that omission and make it the first argument in your appeal. It may be enough to require your school to grant your appeal and, at least, give you the required process before deciding your case.  Assuming that the deadline has not passed, you should review the Student Handbook and determine what information is required for an appeal, with whom it must be filed, and in what form it must be prepared.  You should then prepare your written appeal â€“ in compliance with the requirements stated in the Student Handbook.  If your deadline to appeal has passed, you can request permission to file a late appeal, but it will most likely be denied.  If the deadline is coming up fast and you need more time, request an extension.  Most schools will grant an extension if requested before the deadline passes. It is important that you be forthright in the appeal. The school likely has evidence about the context in which the photograph was shared - i.e., what was being said in the chat post to which it was attached. You might be able to persuade the school to reduce your penalty to a suspension or letting you continue on probation. You may want an attorney help you prepare the appeal, but the deadline to file an appeal is probably coming up, so you must consult with an attorney quickly. Contact your county bar association, request the names and telephone numbers of attorneys who practice education law and contact one of them right away. If the school denies your appeal, your only remaining option is to challenge the school's determination in a special proceeding in the New York State Supreme Court. You will likely want an attorney to represent you in such an effort. A successful challenge will require you to demonstrate that the school failed to provide adequate process â€“i.e., give you an opportunity to defend yourself - and/or that the penalty is so disproportionate to the offense, that it shocks the conscience. This last argument is very difficult to demonstrate. If you did not file a timely appeal with the school, however, this option may not be available to you.  You should ask the county bar association to provide you with referrals to attorneys who specialize in education law and consult with one of them right away. There is a short period of time in which you can file a judicial challenge to the denial of your appeal, so you must consult with an attorney in that event as soon as possible.43629.6513888889 I'm a student in a nursing school and we were in a group chat on site at a location doing clinical rotations and a photo was actually be taken of a patient and a student which was shared amongst a lot of other photos upon realizing what was done I requested that everyone delete the photos that I shared however someone didn't and they showed it to the entire School. when I was first confronted I was scared so I denied it however later on I did come forward and said that I did take the photo and shared it and it was an accident and I asked everyone to delete it however I was expelled immediately and was not really given the opportunity to explain my case I want to fight this and I need some advice as to how I can go about doing this since the program ends in ###.43629.4347222222 I was recently was advised my children's school had lied to me about where scratches on his face came from, from a teacher that quit because of how things were run. I also had been asking multiple times about food what they were eating and the last and final straw was telling me they were not monitored! My kids are ###! Were there from 8am to 6pm! I made a public post when I had my final straw and removed them from school notifying the public of my concerns/issues along with proof. The owner is going around telling people I did this because I am mad she kicked my kids out when I have it in writing that that's a lie! She is now claiming harassment and slander as multiple strangers parents and prior staff are coming out and speaking up about incidents they also witnessed. She's actually slandering me! She's putting my husband's personal legal business on her school post and he has nothing to do with her not caring for the children properly. 43668.61875 Ms. ###, The short answer to your question is yes but there are potential issues in doing so that you should consider. First, while your post states that the daycare center's owner/operator is defaming you and your family, bear in mind that the daycare center or its owner can file a lawsuit against you concerning any public statements you make, claiming that they are false and, therefore, defamatory.  While truth is an absolute defense to a defamation claim, such a lawsuit would still require you to defend yourself against such a lawsuit and you would want to be in a position to clearly prove that your representations are truthful. Even if you can do so, defending against such a claim will require you to spend a significant amount of money. While you and/or your husband may have a claim or counterclaim for defamation against the daycare center, such a claim is only as valuable as the damages caused by the daycare center's misrepresentations. You state that your husband's business has been adversely impacted by the daycare center's misrepresentations, but it's not clear to what extent. If it has not been significant or you cannot clearly who that the damage is the result of the misrepresentations, you might consider another approach, as discussed below. There is a type of defamation, known as per se libel (written defamation) or slander (verbal defamation), for which special damages do not have to be proven and which allows a court to award damages based on the fact that the defamation occurred at all. Such defamation exists where the defamatory statements adversely impact someone's ability to earn a living (i.e., went directly to his/her ability to have employment, operate a business, or practice a profession) or which subjected the person to significant ridicule in the community. Perhaps the alleged misrepresentations of the daycare center would qualify as per se defamation, but I don't think it is beyond argument - at least not based on your post.So, while you can publicly speak about the daycare center and its quality of care, etc. â€“ especially since it arguably invited such comment by making representations about your children's attendance to third parties with whom it should not have discussed such a matter - you want to be able to back up whatever you say with evidence.It may be more productive for you to file a complaint with the Office For Children and Family Services, which supervises and licenses daycare centers. If you believe your children were denied meals, water (except for ###), and improperly supervised, or that the daycare center violated other regulations, you can file a complaint with the OCFS, which will investigate the complaint promptly.  You should expect that the first thing the daycare center will say in response to such a complaint is that you are a disgruntled parent who is upset that her children were expelled from the daycare center and be prepared to demonstrate that you actually withdrew your children.There is another alternative: if you and your husband are concerned about the daycare center continuing to make misrepresentations about you and your children in the community, you can hire an attorney to send the daycare center a cease-and-desist letter, which would state that the claims being made by the daycare center operator are false and, if they continue, they will be held liable for the money damages such misrepresentations cause. Often, such a letter is sufficient to put a stop to such behavior.  You can check with your County Bar Association for references to attorneys who practice in commercial litigation or who have experience handling defamation cases.Let me know if you have any questions.43671.6430555556 Thank you for your response. I have no interest in taking the school to court but simply bringing awareness to parents. I purposely shared my own experiences and have ample amount of proof showing this situations, she can claim slander but I have conversations proving my claims truthful. I was only concerned because of course if she does follow through with slander" and "harassment" charges I want to be prepared. (I am just do not have a lawyer as of yet but I have everything I need otherwise) My husband is currently incarcerated and has never met any of the people at this business and she posted on fb that my husband is a "known dangerous convicted felon" of which my husband has nothing to do with this situation at all and that is where she's now crossing personal lines. She has told people my children were kicked out which was a lie. She has deleted all my children's pics from their days at the facility. (months of pictures I can not get back) emails between us and pictures of the quarter sandwiches they were being fed. I still feel I have enough. She has gone on fb in the same post as my husbands stating there is a warrant being processed for me. I work with Doctors for a huge cancer facility that is something that could cause me to lose my job same with if I was to be arrested for being accused of harassment and threatening and I haven't once done either. As stated this is more to have an idea when/IF she tries to take me to court but this now has been a week and no papers have been served and I have spoken to police and they stated she has yet to be able to provide any proof. Everyone else's claims of abuse and ### I can not say are true or false but I do know another parent pulled their child last Friday as he stated the teacher would pin him down with her legs.

I also had been asking multiple times about food what they were eating and the last and final straw was telling me they were not monitored! My kids are ###! Were there from 8am to 6pm! I made a public post when I had my final straw and removed them from school notifying the public of my concerns/issues along with proof. The owner is going around telling people I did this because I am mad she kicked my kids out when I have it in writing that that's a lie! She is now claiming harassment and slander as multiple strangers parents and prior staff are coming out and speaking up about incidents they also witnessed. She's actually slandering me! She's putting my husband's personal legal business on her school post and he has nothing to do with her not caring for the children properly.

The school has blamed her for the student putting his hands down her pants. And has done nothing to make her feel safe. The teachers said that they didnt see anything even though my daughter raised her hand for help. The meetings we have had just ends with the school blaming my daughter's pants. We tried to put some regulations on the table, separating the two, and those weren't followed.  The school also failed to follow protocol. They dis not report it, our doctor had too. And they have yet to show us an incident report. We are just curious where we go from here?43865.7131944444 Thank you. I'll file and go from there. 43865.8555555556 The ages of the children are such that a report to the Child Abuse Hotline may nit have been required. However, the incident appears to be a clear case of sexual harassment (hostile educational environment) and the ages of the students involved does not change that fact. Sexual harassment in an educational institution that receives federal funds must comply with Title IX if the Education Amendments of ### (â€œTitle IX). This statute and itâ€™s related regulations require public school systems to have a Title IX policy in place and to follow it. Among other things, the policy must require a timely investigation of a report of sexual harassment in the educational setting. That investigation should be undertaken as soon as possible and if the investigation bears out the report, the school should implement corrective action action to minimize the likelihood of sUCB conduct recurring. Even where the investigation cannot conclusively establish that the sexual harassment occurred, a school should offer and implement some corrective action, such as class reassignments (not necessarily your daughterâ€™s reassignment), schedule changes, increased supervision efforts, or other appropriate measures. Such conduct is also prohibited by the Dignity for All Students Act (Education Law Â§ 2-d) (DASA), and it must have a policy in place for how it will respond to such incidents under this statute, in addition to Title IX. The School District should have followed its policy under the Dignity for All Students Act and itâ€™s Title IX policy. You should review these (they should be online). You can file a complaint against the school district with the US Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, which will investigate the matter and push the school district to respond appropriately. It may result in a settlement between you and the district, which would probably not include payment of any money damages, but would require the district to take measures to avoid noncompliance in the future. Title IX also provides students with a private cause of action for its violation, which could include money damages, if they exist, and attorneyâ€™s fees. However, there do not appear to be any such damages at this point. (At least one Court in New York has also held that DASA provides a private cause of action, although the statue suggests otherwise.) My guess is that you are not as focused on obtaining money damages as you are on ensuring that the district takes the appropriate measures to prevent this from happening again and to allow your child to attend school without being intimidated or afraid. Therefore, the complaint to the US Department if Education may be your preferred option. You can find the complaint form online. You can also complete and file the complaint online. Here is the link to do so:  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaints-how.html  43865.8055555556 Dear ###,A lot of people have been filing lawsuits against educational institutions, including class action suits, alleging breach of contract in connection with their failure to provide educational services due to the coronavirus.  It is too early to tell how successful they will be.  An online search turned up at least one class action suit brought against RIT, here is a link:  https://www.classaction.org/media/mycek-v-rochester-institute-of-technology.pdf  The suit was only filed a few days ago and I can't tell how likely you are to receive any compensation from it.  Another option would be for you to bring your own lawsuit for breach of contract.

At my annual ### meeting, my district offered to give my son regents credits for ### ###.  He passed the courses but failed the regents for Global History and Earth Science.At the end of this year (###20), he will have had ### and English ### (the Eng just being given this year).   My son still has English 12, US History, and US Government courses to take.   A reading program has also been agreed to as heâ€™s on a ###.  I know I can keep him until age 21 (which I plan to do ), so that he can attend a vocational program to work on acquiring independent living skills and work experience.  My question is :  Can I keep him in the district until ###, if I consent to the other ###?   As this would in essence have him completing his ### ###, and hence the district can force him out.Or should I not consent to the regents credit for past failed regents and have him sit again for the regents eventually?  I would really hate to have him sit for these regents again--it will be a waste of time and it causes him so much stress and anxiety.But I really feel that we need to address the transition services to prepare him for post-secondary life, and the district is responsible to transition from school to the real world.     My son needs to learn to build those skills of self-adovcacy, writing resumes, ###, travel training and actual hands-on experience before exiting high school.  Can we have the ### 21?  How should we proceed?  Thanks,###43970.7833333333 I would recommend you ask the district what they will do in writing. If you can get them to commit to allowing him to stay until he's 21, then you can likely take the credits. But you seem to imply that by law they can force him out" once he has the required credits. If they can in their discretion then you seem to have answered your own question. Without knowing the intricacies of educational law nor with seeing his report card school records and any written correspondence you've had with the district it is impossible to answer this question. My only recommendation would be to demand the district explain all of your options in writing. If they stat that you CANNOT do something you think is an option then I recommend you contact an attorney for direct representation. This forum cannot help you negotiate or resolve a direct dispute with someone. The prudent thing of course would be to just work with what you have and what the district is willing to do. But make sure to get everything in writing including their promises on what your son is allowed to do.I venture to guess the district has your son's interests in mind so an in-depth conversation with the district including all the way up to the superintendent is probably the best action rather than an attorney at this time. I'm not sure a lawsuit is a proper nor efficient nor affordable method to solve this confusion. But sure in theory the district could be violating some requirement and if so you could force them to comply with a civil action. But that could take months if not years to conclude. You should also consider ### this to your state city or local representatives ### mayor etc. and see if they can assist your interaction with the school district. It's important you escalate this to a senior official with the most discretion to get the best answer. ### agents often make mistakes misrepresentations or are misinformed and are not motivated to help solve difficult situations.Please note you may qualify for direct free legal representation or find other valuable information here: ###/.

Our son started Kindergarten last year, and it was a disaster. He ended up with an IEP for ### Defiant Disorder, but when I realized that his Autism evaluation and his behaviors were similar, if not identical to my own either now or when I was a child, I pursued my own formal Autism evaluation, and it was discovered that I have Asperger's Syndrome ###. ###, my ### second cousin got his Asperger's diagnosis, and I've now established that it's entirely possible at least half a dozen other members of my family are ### ###. My ex-husband keeps saying that he doesn't see our son's markers in his home, but I've heard from more than one person that one parent sometimes will live in a state of denial because they can't handle the emotional strain of potentially being the cause of those behaviors. My ex has also said that he doesn't want our son on meds, because my ex's brother was diagnosed with depression as a teenager, and was found a few times sitting by a loaded shotgun, thinking about suicide. I'm not a fan of ### a child myself, especially since Autism isn't something that can be 'cured' or even treated or managed fully with just one medication. The evaluation I was given covers pretty much every mental illness and disability that exists, so even if our son has something besides Autism, we would know at our second visit with the therapist. While our son receives some pretty amazing support at school with the diagnosis he currently has on file, that diagnosis was thrown at the school like a Hail ### pass, so he wouldn't keep getting suspended, and even the therapist who said it wasn't fully confident in it. To date, neither of his behavioral therapists has given any of us any type of written evaluation forms to fill out for our son, and I remain adamant that this needs to be done. Since my ex-husband doesn't agree, it's my understanding that I need to appeal to a judge to have our son formally evaluated for disabilities, but I don't know where to start. I live over budget. I went back to school to hopefully qualify for a higher paying position because I need more money, and I've had over half a dozen failed job interviews trying to get promoted, and my company can't give me a raise because I'm contracted. I have no idea how I'd pay an attorney to represent me, and I'm afraid if I make the wrong move, I'll never see my son again. How can I get him what he needs?44428.6069444444 Here we go , ###.

The cops could not have reasonably believed that there was anything in the backpack that was on fire, and I can't think of any other good (or constitutional) reason to search your backpack when you weren't there and didn't consent to it.  On the other hand, I would not recommend that you file a complaint since nothing was damaged or taken and you say that there was ### in your bag, which is a bad fact.  As to whether anything more could come out of this, while there are no guarantees, it seems very likely that this is the end of the matter -- it just isn't logical for the cops to pursue the matter later, given that they did not seize the ### or arrest you or give you any sort of citation at the time.   44071.8347222222 I should add that I just don't know whether there is any potential violation of your ### code of conduct or housing rules that could be a problem, or whether the school has any way of finding out what happened.44071.8368055556 Recently my dorm building had a fire drill and everyone was evacuated.

They took me and my roommateâ€™s names down but have had no further action. I was just concerned as to if they were legally allowed to search my room when it wasnâ€™t the one that set off the fire alarm and if thereâ€™s anything more that can come out of this.44071.6409722222 Hello:This is your school's reopening plan: https://www.whitesvillesd.org/Domain/254I realize this response is late but I am assuming this issue has been resolved.44151.5590277778 My children attend a public school in Allegany County called Whitesville Central School. It is on Whitesville, NY. Here starts one of the ###. We live in ### in a county just over the border. A year ago, before Covid-### 7th- 14th/15th in October. My children are in 5th grade and Kindergarten. Ages ### 5. Our Principal and Superintendent know about this trip. They both told me that because this trip is in a banned state we will have to mandatory ### our children when we get back. We understand that is NY rules, PA rules are that you can come back as soon as you get a negative Covid-###. The problem is.. Our Principal and Superintendent say that the ### would be considered ### because it is our choice to go on this Vacation and that with that said they can/will charge us with Truancy. How is that possible if this is a mandatory ### where we have to call the County Health Department and tell them we went on vacation, and where they will tell us it is mandatory? One would think that with Covid-###. I also feel like she is bullying and discriminating against my family as a PA resident attending a NY school, because on more than one occasion she has mentioned to us and I will quote  It is a Privilege for you to attend this school being as you are a PA resident We have the right to choose to stays and who goes to this school." I am not the only parent in PA that she has said this too. I am afraid to speak up and advocate for my children when it comes to things there for fear that she will throw that in my face again and have us kicked out. I feel like this Truancy thing is a way for her to have her way.How is this possible and fair? I want to fight it but don't know how much it would cost or how long it would take.. They say Whitesville is 100% Face to Face instruction. Which is great but something should be put into place for Students that have to go into mandatory ###. They said it would be different if my kids came into contact with someone with Covid but it was our choice to go on our vacation. I wish I knew where to go from here? Our local School district said that we could transfer our kids and that they would provide us with the Blended online school program while we are gone and while we ###/wait for our negative test results. They also called our superintendent and she confirmed to him that she would charge Truancy on us if we went. What should we do? Do we have grounds for anything? "44103.8506944444 Good afternoon,Was the disorderly charge resolved? If so, how? That can impact whatever decision the school decides to take. I presume that there is a handbook that sets forth the procedures the school has to follow in coming to a decision. I suggest you study that guide, keeping in mind what your in house" appeal rights are.If this stems from your playing your music too loud then the essential question is. . . says who? What objective measure was used (if any) to determine if the loudness of the music violated the law."44139.7361111111 I recently had a few people over my house, ### (including me), to be exact. As the 'host' I was given a disorderly conduct ticket for unreasonable noise, never given a warning, just immediately handed a ticket; which was just also just a violation. The school recently caught wind of it and I now have a hearing with the Student Conduct Board to discuss my future.I was charged by the school with:Prohibited Off-Campus Gathering (HOST): Students who host an off campus gathering of any size, indoor or outdoor, that exceeds the current limitation published by the institution, Executive Order, or the State or local Department of Health.Disruptive or Disorderly Behavior: Disruption to the community including, but not limited to excessive or unreasonable noise, excessively large parties, throwing of projectiles or rude and abusive language or behavior.Violation of Law: Behavior that would constitute a violation of any federal, state or local law including city or county ordinances.I just had a pre-conference and the person I spoke to said the likely outcome was expulsion or suspension from the school. That seems extremely harsh considering the only thing I did wrong was play music too loud. I never violated any social gathering rules, our school stated ###, I had 8. They also claimed I was arrested, which I most definitely was not. I've been at this school for the past ###'ve ever had a run-in with Student Conduct was for forgetting to empty my trash in my dorm before winter break a couple years ago. My question is how likely it is that I'm actually suspended from the school?

A number of kids in his advisory received the text directed toward him. It was sent via one student's account but that student has denied sending it and there is no evidence that this student sent the text. We filed a police report the next day - it was filed as a harassment case. The school and ### both filed reports with the DOE.  I did reach out to the DOE's LBGTQ Advocate.   He contacted legal who then contacted the Principal and they directed him to do an investigation. The Principal did an investigation that did not yield any insight as to who sent the text.  He did inform the DOE that this is clearly a violation of the Chancellor's regulation A832.  I also filed a report with the ### Human Rights Commission.  The day after the incident a teacher at the school contacted the Remind App and was told that with a subpoena they could determine the IP address of the person who sent the text. The Principal asked DOE Legal about this and they were told it was not necessary. I have not been contacted by anyone at the DOE and there has been no additional activity.  I believe it is important to figure out who sent this text to determine accountability.  I have been very clear about that with both the school Principal and the LGBTQ Advocate at the DOE.  While the Principal agrees, it seems as though he feels he has done all he can.  I contacted one law firm who would be happy to work with me but the legal fees are higher than  I can afford right now.   I am looking for some guidance as to how best to address this situation.   Can I request a Subpoena?  How do I do that?   Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you.### ###44225.8916666667 Ms. ###, The School District has an obligation to investigate and take credible action to deter such conduct in the future under the Dignity for All Students Act (Art. ### of the Education Law) and, apparently, Title IX of the Education Amendments of ###, in addition to its own policies.  To state a claim under Title IX, your child would have to show that the harassment was pervasive within the educational environments and prevented your child from accessing the District's programs. A ### incident does not constitute a violation of Title IX. Instead, it would be necessary to show that the District tolerated (i.e., failed to take credible action to stop/prevent) frequent or egregious acts of harassment based on your child's sex or gender identification. However, a single incident may constitute a basis for a claim under the City's Human Rights Law, which also prohibits sex ### and educational institutions within the City. At least one court has held that a ### can assert a private cause of action for a violation of the Dignity for All Students Act (DASA), but I think this is still unsettled law. In any event, a claim under DASA would also likely require proof of a number of incidents of harassment based on your child's gender that occurred with some frequency or, alternatively, that were particularly egregious (e.g., assault). You would have to show a series of incidents with some level of frequency or ### and a lack of credible action on the part of the District to stop the harassment.I and confused by the District's response, however. I assume that these accounts are password-protected. If that is the case, it would seem to me that the student to whom the account is assigned and who claims that he/he did not send the message should have to demonstrate some reasonable possibility that his/her account was illegally And it seems to me that the student to whom the account is assigned should have to demonstrate how somebody else could have access the account. Unless there is some credible reason to suspect that this student's account may have been hacked or used by somebody else, there does not seem to be a reasonable basis for the District to conclude that the Student is not responsible. However, reasonable minds could disagree on this point and the District has to be careful that it does not violate the rights of an accused student and risk the liability from that end. In any event, I suggest asking that question (i.e., if the accounts are password-protected, why is the student to whom this account is assigned not being held accountable unless he/she can demonstrate a reasonable possibility that somebody else access to the account). As for issuing a subpoena to the service to obtain the IP address from which the message was sent, the District may be able to issue such a subpoena do under Education Law 321444228.5944444444 Hello ###. We're sorry that you and your child are experiencing this issue. However, we will need some more specific information before we can advise you on a possible course of action. For example, what is the medical issue that arose with your child? And how is it related to COVID-19, if it is related? Also, what were the dates involved?

I just dont know what do to or if there is anything to do 44328.8138888889 I note that CUNY policy permits instructors to require that a final be taking on-camera via the Zoom service to ensure academic integrity, although, according to your post, the policy requires that the instructor state this requirement in his/her syllabus, which this instructor failed to do. Arguably, under the circumstances stated in your post, it would be unreasonable for CUNY or the professor to penalize you for not activating the camera, given the late hour. (Candidly, I do not understand why these interactions occurred at ###:###. That fact, by itself, seems substantially inappropriate, but perhaps there are circumstances for this late hour that you did not state in your post.)Legal representation may be helpful in preparing any appeal that you may need to pursue relative to the grade you receive and/or any action program action that CUNY might undertake based on that grade, but the decision will ultimately be made on the policy and the reasonableness of the requirement. If it is necessary for you to undertake such appeals, it is very important that you download CUNY Student Handbook and ensure you understand the requirements for such an appeal and timely comply with them. Failure to do so could preclude further review by a court or another entity. Presumably, the appeal would focus on the reasons why you did not wish to activate the camera and that the requirement was not stated in the professor's syllabus, in contravention of the CUNY policy. If you need to challenge your grade and/or any program action, it is imperative that you timely and properly file an appeal with CUNY in that regard, ensuring your appeal complies with all requirements stated in the CUNY handbook and/or the handbook of your program or department. If you fail to timely file that appeal, you will likely be prevented from challenging such matters in the New York State Supreme Court.You should know that even if you do comply with the appeal requirements and properly file a challenge in court, it may not succeed. There is a long line of case law stating that courts are ### to second-guess academic determinations and they should generally defer to the decisions of the academic institution unless there is clear evidence of impropriety. Accordingly, a court may decline to review CUNY's decisions on these matters, even if you have completed the administrative appeal process.Sometimes, discretion is the better part of valor. You may want to reconsider the option of retaking the test. I appreciate that doing so would impose a significant burden on you, particularly given your employment, but if you refuse to do it, you may suffer serious academic consequences, and a court may decline to hear an appeal in its regard. I assume the professor and CUNY would be cooperative in scheduling a time for you to ### the examination.Please let me know if you have other questions in this regard.### ###44343.0013888889 Incident ### @ around ######:###:Professor ### Lazaridis responded to my informal request about his breach in the CUNY policy asking for a Zoom ###.

Unfortunately, I hadn't attended and didn't know zoom attendance was mandatory, as attendance was never specified as mandatory on his syllabus/announcements, and mandatory online live proctoring (with cameras on) was never communicated prior to registration, enrollment, and the final. CUNY policy states that unless it was stated on the syllabus at the onset of the course, faculty may not require cameras, even for exams. Rules are in place for a reason and to protect students and faculty.  I took my finals in accordance with the CUNY Academic Policy and his syllabus guidelines.

Since I don't know the details of your CPS case I would direct your question to your caseworker.

If I can't home school, can I move her to a different school district?43509.1270833333 My daughter is special needs. She was harassed by a new teacher.  Another teacher reported it to the administrators. We where promised an investigation. When nothing was done we requested open records. After going through ###. The investigation had turned to the teacher that reported incident. The principals daughter is in the same class and the principal hand picked the teacher in question to handle his daughter who has behavior issues. This same teacher allegedly shoved a non verbal disabled child down and refused to give her breakfast which she is required to have. The same teacher reported this as the last incident. She was then told if she reported any more wrong doings she would be fired and the school would file harassment charges against her. It was clear at this point the school was covering up wrong doings. We went up as high as we could go, meeting after meeting, being promised investigations into the allegations. through open records we found out that everyone we spoke with was involved in the communications from the start. As there was no actual physical abuse we felt our hands were tied. Then several weeks ago a new student teacher arrived in one of my daughters classes. He harassed my daughter to the point she left the room crying on several ### my daughter is special needs. It got to the point that three of her fellow students reported the issue to the assistant principal. The student teacher was removed from teaching my daughter. The school did not report any of this to his college professor. The student teacher just graduated and should be receiving his teaching certificate. Once again staff is allowed to harass, special needs students and the administrators do everything in there power to cover it up. I have emailed the school board and no response.  I assume since there was no physical abuse towards my daughter here is nothing we can do. We know that the school district is in cover there butt" mode and nothing will be done. It is ### to think that teachers and administrators who are supposed to be here to hep kids will be allowed to continue this behavior towards special needs kids especially the non verbal kids who can't speak for themselves. My daughter is graduating in about a week so we feel this will all go away and the school can continue to harass and abuse special needs children.This is a very short version of everything that has gone on. I guess my question would be: Is there any legal action that can be taken?Thank you for your time It is sincerely appreciated.### ######-######"43607.1916666667 Hello, I am a father of two. My son, ###.5y/o, is recently accepted to a pre-school program at The ### Hill School on ###. We were enrolled in the extended calendar M-F from 7:### ### (extensive hours is 7:### ###, regular hours ### ###, also includes certain holidays ). Since the starting of preschool (###), His school has been interrupted due to his recent cough this Thursday and Friday 9/### ###.  (No fever). I talked to the school nurse, she thinks he is completely fine and multiple kids in that group have had symptoms.On this Friday, ###, My wife received a phone call from the director of the school stating that he is very active (the kid is ###.###, for God's sake,) and the teacher canâ€™t watch him during extensive hours due to staffing issue. (We were told its ### ###). And if we canâ€™t accommodate for regular hours from ### ###, they will return hour tuition and withdraw him. I also called the director of the school and received the same message, and I was recommended to put my son into an alternative for child special education.Of note, due to Nolanâ€™s hyperactivity behavior, he also has a teacher (behavior instructor), Ms. ###, coming every Tuesday and Friday to teach him how to focus for the past a few months and currently she comes to our apt on Tuesday and goes to school on Friday.My wife and I are both health care workers for the state. We donâ€™t think we will be able to accommodate their change from the extended calendar to the regular calendar (regular doesn't cover holidays). Especially they give us a ### notice to let us accommodate by Wednesday (###). I am a surgical resident, and I am currently taking time off to watch both of my kids due to lack of childcare and my wifeâ€™s emotional distress at this point. I was relieved that we found the childcare for him at ### hill. But now, this is a huge blow to my career and I might need to stay even longer at home which costs my paycheck and potential career.I am concerned that the school is actively discriminating against my son and labeling him inappropriately. Since they accepted him and now forcing our hand to change his childcare schedule to regular hours, at the last minute, it will severely impact my returning to work, delay the completion of my education which could be meaning millions of dollars. And just based on Ms. ###, my fear is that they will plan to expel my son at some point and this change of hours is just the first step. This issue has also caused a lot of emotional stress to my wife and me, especially with her history of depression and anxiety. I am wondering if I can seek a legal consult regarding my experience and if there are any referrals, I can receive to discuss my case.44457.6569444444 Your post raises two questions: (###000487) whether ### Hill is providing adequate supervision as a daycare center, consistent with New York State regulations and has provided your son with reasonable accommodations to permit his continued attendance in the extended program; and (###000652) whether your child may be entitled to additional early intervention services as a child the disabilities. I will address each of these issues separately.First, the ### Hill program is a daycare center, as that ### is defined by the regulations of the Department of Social Services. (A daycare center is one is not operated in a residence that provides care for more than ### ###, step-parents, guardians, or relatives of the children [relatives being defined to include grandparents, great-grandparents, aunts, and uncles and their spouses and great aunts and uncles and their spouses]). (### Â§ 4###0004873.###000652[a][###000487].)Accordingly, for your child's age (### ###), it must provide supervision at a ratio of one teacher for every five children in a maximum group size of ###. (Next year, it will be a ratio of one teacher for every seven children and a maximum group size of ###000###00048795.) The State provided some exceptions to these regulations because of COVID, allowing daycare centers more flexibility in mixing children of different age groups, among other things, but the supervision ratios were not modified. Furthermore, the Executive Order providing these exceptions has expired.) If the ### Hill program is not providing supervision consistent with these ratios, the problem would appear to be its noncompliance with the law - not your child.So, my first question is whether ### Hill has complied with the regulations relative to supervision. It must maintain records concerning its provision of supervision during each day and you can ask it to provide you with that information. Doing so may be perceived as adversarial and complicate the relationship, but you may already be at a point where that is no longer a concern.Relative to ### Hill's claim that your child's behavior requires his removal from the extended program because of his behavior, this statement might be viewed as a tacit admission that it is engaging in disability discrimination. You do not indicate if your child has been classified as a child with disabilities, but I assume that to be the case, given his receipt of services from a behavioral instructor, which I assume is being provided as part of an early intervention program. Accordingly, ### Hill understands that he is a child with disabilities and, therefore, protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (###.S.C. Â§ ###000487###000652###0004870###000487, et. seq.) (â€œ###â€), which it is subject to as a place of public accommodation. As stated in a policy statement of the New York State Bureau of Early Childhood Services (Policy Statement No. 06-###://ocfs.ny.gov/programs/childcare/policies/Childcare-Policy-06-3-###-Compliance-Issues.pdf]): The basic requirement of the ### is that places of public accommodation may not discriminate against children with disabilities unless the presence of such children would: (###000487) pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others; or (###000652) require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program. Programs subject to the ### must make reasonable accommodations to enable children with disabilities to participate in the program. All regulated daycare programs, including those operated out of a family home or residence, fall within the ###'s definition of a public accommodation except for daycare programs operated by religious entities.* * *When a parent seeks admission of a child with disabilities to a day care program or wishes to keep the child with disabilities in a day care program, the day care provider must make an individual assessment of the needs of that child and de###ine whether the child can be accommodated in the day care program without making fundamental alterations in the program.â€¦ Each situation must be individually assessed to review all the various factors before a decision on whether or not to accept the child with a disability into the program is made.* * *To de###ine whether accepting a child with a disability will constitute a fundamental alteration of the program, the program must analyze the nature and cost of any changes to the ### policies and practices that would be necessary to accommodate the child.Cost, although not the only factor, is one factor to consider in de###ining whether accommodating a child with a disability would constitute a fundamental alteration of the program.* * *The ### does not require that a day care program except the child who poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others into the day care program. In addition, if the public accommodation needed to accept the child with a disability into the day care program poses a significant risk to the health and safety of others and there is no reasonable accommodation that could be made to eliminate the health and safety risk, then the day care program does not have to accept the child with a disability into the day care program. The de###ination of whether a particular child poses a direct threat to others must be based on an individualized assessment[.]Based on your post, the ### Hill program has not claimed that your child poses a direct threat to others or that it cannot make a reasonable accommodation for him. (The fact that ### Hill has agreed to permit him to transition to the regular program is a tacit admission that your son does not pose a direct threat to others.) Rather, it claims that its staffing is inadequate to provide sufficient supervision. This excuse begs the question of whether ### Hill is complying with the supervision regulations (see above). In any event, depending on the specifics of your son's case, it appears that the excuse is not a valid exception to the requirements of the ###.Therefore, the program can only exclude your child if it can demonstrate that providing a reasonable accommodation for your child is so cost-prohibitive that it constitutes a fundamental alteration of the program. It seems unlikely that adding an additional staff member to the class or just having one available is cost-prohibitive. Moreover, the Office of Children and Family Services (which regulates daycare centers) (â€œOCFSâ€) is likely to see the cost of such an accommodation as a daycare center's cost of doing business. I also note that, in its communications with you, ### Hill's representatives have not claimed that the supervision is cost-prohibitive, but that it was having difficulty maintaining supervision levels. However, providing the required level of supervision is not optional. I think it is reasonable for you to ask ### Hill to provide information about the supervision ratios provided during the day. You might do so by saying that you are confused by the communication indicating that it is having difficulty staffing the program and wish to know what that means. You should also ask ### Hill if it is telling you that your son requires a ###000487:###? Wouldn't one additional staff person â€“ not necessarily a teacher â€“ who is generally available to the class be sufficient? If they are reluctant to answer these questions, I would suggest telling them that you are trying to understand so that you don't misperceive the reason for your son's removal of your son from the extended program.### Hill may respond that transitioning your son to the regular program is a reasonable accommodation. The Office for Children and Family Services or the Division of Human Rights or a court may accept that claim as an adequate explanation for your son's removal from the extended program. Your position has to be that ### Hill is obligated to provide a reasonable accommodation in the extended program and simply removing your son from that program is not an accommodation at all, but exclusion. It's unclear how that would play out if it were sued.Another way to approach this issue is to ask ### Hill if the problem would be resolved if your son obtained additional supervision by way of a ###000487:###. Presumably, it would answer in the affirmative and would be willing to assist you in trying to obtain that additional service.Assuming that your child has been identified as a child with disabilities and is receiving the services of a behavioral instructor through an early intervention program, you can ask his case manager to increase the services so he can remain in his program. If he is not classified as a child with disabilities and you reasonably think that his behavior may indicate a disability, you should look into having him evaluated to de###ine if he is eligible for early intervention services.If your child is presently identified as a child with disabilities, you should contact the individual managing his early intervention program and notify that person about what has happened at ### Hill. You should ask for additional services as part of your son's early intervention program, including a ###000487:###. If you are successful in obtaining the aid, that would remove the daycare center's objection to his placement in the extended program. In light ask ### Hill to agree with that proposition upfront, so you can present that to the individual managing your son's early intervention program. (It is possible, I suppose, that your son might qualify for daycare services through an early intervention program, separate and apart from ### Hill, but a lot would depend upon the hours during which the program would be available and I think you would want to be reasonably sure that the children in that program are at a roughly equivalent level of functioning, relative to your son.)If ### Hill simply refuses to return your son to the extended program, regardless of any additional services he might obtain through early intervention, you can file a complaint with the OCFS, alleging that the program is discriminating against your child because of his disability and may be in violation of supervision ratios. In addition, you can file a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights, alleging that the program discriminated against your child based on his disability in violation of New York Executive Law Â§###. You can also commence a lawsuit against the program on that basis, although unless an attorney agrees to represent you and your son on a contingency basis (i.e., the attorney is only paid fees in the event you recover money damages against ### Hill, although you may still be responsible to pay for certain costs), a lawsuit may be cost-prohibitive in your current circumstances.If in regard to your residency program, while courts have held that residency programs are educational programs, they have also been deemed to constitute an employment relationship. Accordingly, you are entitled to time off from your residency under the Family Medical Leave Act if you, your spouse, or your child has a serious health condition and you are providing care in that regard. In some cases, such leave may be in###ittent (e.g., an hour or two each day or periodic leave). Your residency institution must have an FMLA policy in place, and you should carefully review it. Presumably, your residency institution is willing to schedule you around this predicament. if you have not raised this issue with your residency coordinator, you may wish to do so. You should also find out if the hospital where your work has a daycare program.44459.6506944444 Good evening,my name is urenna and Iâ€™m a nursing student at a school in New ###. I have a new professor that set up a google spreadsheet to â€œsignâ€ up for exam between ###. I signed myself and my classmate up for the class with her permission. Later on that night I checked the spreadsheet and the classmates name was not there. I was nervous and thought I hadnâ€™t signed her up. Or maybe the app was glitchy since I was going it on my phone. I then put her name up there for the second time that day.### next day, the professor sends me an email ccâ€™d me, my classmate, herself and the ### of our school saying that a student said I altered and removed her name from the spreadsheet to put my classmates name and that act show a violation of academic integrity. I immediately tried contacting the professor and she told me itâ€™s best we speak via email. I then refrained from contacting her.Today the ### of the college emailed me requesting us to meet next Monday in person. Iâ€™m a little nervous because I donâ€™t know what to expect. Luckily I have proof of the first time that I entered the classmates name on the spreadsheet because I sent her (my classmate) proof that I had signed her up as well.if not I would have been screwedâ€¦.needless to say Iâ€™m still nervous because I have never been in this situation before please help me.thank you44469.8625 Urenna, There are a few things I think you should do prior to the meeting. First, go to your school's website and find the policies concerning student discipline and academic integrity. Review them carefully so you understand how the school has defined academic integrity and the process that you are about to go through. Pay particular attention to deadlines for you to submit responses or information or appeal a de###ination.It does not appear that you have been charged with misconduct and I suspect the meeting with the ### is part of his/her effort to find out whether you should be charged. It simply is not possible to conduct any part of a disciplinary hearing process without first notifying the accused student of the specific charges to be considered at the hearing. You should also have an opportunity to get additional information, if you need it, among other things. Your post does not indicate you have been charged with anything he had, and, therefore, I suspect this is an effort by the ### to sort out what happened here.You should bring whatever documents you have to demonstrate that you initially attempted to sign up your friend and yourself and you mistakenly thought you had made a mistake and not signed your friend up, so you attempted to do it the second time. In doing so, you had no indication or reason to believe that you had deleted anyone from the roster who had signed up earlier. I think it is critical that you make it clear you did not knowingly or intentionally delete any student from that examination. You had no notice or reason to believe that adding your friend to the roster resulted in anyone been deleted. Certainly, you didn't shade any student's information and delete it to make room for your friend, which appears to be the allegation.It seems that the problem, in this case, is that your professor set up a Google spreadsheet that may have only allowed a certain number of students to sign up and deleted someone when you signed your friend up the second time. You might want to do a little research on Google spreadsheets to see what might have happened relative to the documents set-up. I doubt that the circumstances of your predicament would meet the definition of a violation of academic integrity under the school's policy. That is why I suggest you find that in the student handbook and make sure you understand how it is defined. It usually involves a student engaging in prohibited collaboration on work or test, plagiarism, or similar misconduct. I do not think removing a student from a ### sheet meets the definition. That should not be your lead defense when you speak with the ###, but I would mention that at least once if you think I am correct after you have read the school's definition of that ###.If you are going to be accused of misconduct, the school must give you written notice of any charge ### against you. The student handbook or other policy should layout the discipline process, including your right to get additional information, your right to submit information, and the hearing process. Usually, a college or university will provide a student with the right to have an academic advisor with them at the hearing, although the advisor cannot actively participate. Read all of that and make sure you are familiar with it and aware of any deadlines.Presumably, once you have laid out the facts and presented copies of the sheet that you sent to your friend, the ### will be satisfied. You may also want to get a statement from your friend indicating that the two of you had agreed that you would sign both of you up for the test and that you later told your friend that you signed him/her up again because she thought you had made a mistake. That makes it easier for you to establish that you didn't do anything wrong here, but there was either a problem with the spreadsheet the professor set up or some other problem.44469.88125 Background information on my issue, My friend Tasmia is a ### at UAlbany. She cannot afford school because her father passed away and they took away her financial aid because of that. I don't think that is legal, but that is a different topic. The only reason she can attend school is because being an ### gives her a discount on housing. Recently, a student that has a vendetta against her told the administ###tion she hated her job and was taking her residents to parties downtown." Neither of these statements are true and only backed up by a private text messages saying "I'm going downtown with my residents." Regardless the administ###tion has decided to fire her and remove her housing discount. This cannot be legal this is my friends future we are talking about. My main question is does the school have the right to dictate where their students are going and secondly do they have the right to dictate what their employees do after hours. It would also be beneficial to know if we could sue for heresy and UAlbany lack of due process. "44486.9215277778 Hello:Those are the two main associations that can refer you to pro bono counsel but they are few. I recommend that you at least invest in a consultation with an attorney.44550.5777777778 I'm a teacher aid at a Daycare in Long ###. In ### this year, an event transpired that resulted in my suspension from employment from that organization. Here's how the event occurred:Usually, the teacher-to-student ratio is 8:###. On ###rd, the headteacher wasn't present and I was the only teacher in that class when there were ###. To maintain the ratio, I requested the addition of a teacher to the director but my requests were ignored. After some time, a teacher from a different class was called who brought her own ###. So, now there were ###. One of the students I'm in charge of requires special attention like washing hands and similar needs. For this student, a speech therapist makes visits twice a week. On ###rd, around ###, I told the students to form a line outside the class and in the hallway of the school. Usually, every child would go for themselves to wash their hands except for the child with special needs. As per the protocols that I was briefed by the school, the speech therapist who comes down for the student with special needs, cannot enter the bathroom, and therefore, either the headteacher or the teacher aid can only accompany them for that activity. So, once the lines were formed just outside the class and after everyone was standing in the line, I took this child with special needs to the bathroom, and during this time, the speech therapist was right outside the bathroom along with the other teacher who was with me. When I was in the bathroom with the child washing his hands, I heard a shout outside from one of my students in the hallway. When I got out and counted the number of children in the line, it turned out to be ###. I counted thrice to make sure who was missing and suddenly I realized who was missing. No sooner did I learn about the missing child, than I immediately informed the director of the school who was standing in the adjacent room to the bathroom. Within a span of ###, the child was found to be outside of the school and was immediately brought in and a thorough medical examination was taken place. Fortunately, the child had not sustained any injuries. However, a report has been filed against me where I've been indicated. So, I'm looking for a public attorney who can represent me on the day of the hearing. I'm currently unable to afford the services from private lawyers and therefore, looking for public attorneys at an affordable rate or providing pro bono services. I've tried the ### Legal Aid as well as the ### Bar Association, but I'm yet to hear a definite answer from them.

The same day my daughter was video taped ### up paper to show me what she was doing along with sending me a notice on the class ### of her throwing a pencil . Sometime later on my daughter threw up in class and I was called. I immediately went to the ER and it was then noticed that her lips were extremely dry and her chin was peeling . It was later noticed that the ###  she had on since she threw up was never changed by the school nurse , i notified the ER doctor of this as well and he said this is neglect on the school's part. My daughter then begins her day on ###th  at the new school and when i came to pick her up her hands were ice cold and her teeth were ### she wanted me to zip her coat up due to the fact she was cold . I spoke to the teacher who then says that she seen it but didn't know what it was. When we got home I changed her, cleaned her off and looked at her clothing and she of course peed on her self and it was soaked through all the way to her dress shoes. i have spoken to the school about getting her an evaluation and that she needs assistance on being reminded to go to the rest room i spoke on that my daughter needs help ### her pants to use the toilet yet i can see they have paid no mind to my request at all.44509.6666666667 Please also note that if your daughter is disabled under the law (this is a legal question that a lawyer can help advise you on) then the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuals_with_Disabilities_Education_Act means the school must provide your daughter a Free and Appropriate Public Education.

The same psychiatrist, again later mistrustfully disregarded my honest concerns about the worsening medication side effects (which he had prescribed) which soon sent me into repeated severe illness bouts throughout the spring semester. Those illness bouts caused me to miss a ### and a majority of my assignments, which was then cited as a basis for my removal from the program. Ultimately, those two incidents concerning my former psychiatrist's dubious and almost certainly racist conduct cost me over ###'s end.At the start of the spring semester, I, as a registered member of the ### ### (Center for Students with Disabilities), applied for work accommodations (i.e., deadline extension) to finish the assignments I owed but that request was tossed aside by the department, after which I was then unceremoniously ### from the program. I appealed the dismissal but that was rejected. I arrived home in ###. I then spent the next 10-### +500-page report to provide a holistic view of my experience to refute the racism and stereotypical assumptions which were used to oust me.  In ###20, I reached out to the ### of the graduate school to inform him of my intention to contest my removal and in October, I submitted part ###, which primarily focused on describing in greater detail the same issues I summarized above. For the next ###, I heard nothing from his office. In ###21, I sent him the 2nd part of the report and after supposedly reading it, he suggested that I submit my report to the university's ### (Office of Institutional Equity") to "investigate" it and I reluctantly did so in March. Five months later in August this year that office came out with a report ### full of hyp###isy and cruel cynicism. They rejected my claims that I was discriminated against. I was apoplectic with indignation because their report completely neglected the explanations I had endured so much anguish and depression to ### and instead accused me of being the problem. It is undoubtedly the most shameful conduct I have ever witnessed and it became clear to me that the ### must have been sanctioned by the ###. It seems to me that they must have calculated that since my complaint had already expired the ### limit my allegations were thus toothless and easy for them to disregard. So do I have a case here?Since all the events I described above took place in fall ### ### my attempt to file a complaint with the department of ### ### (office of civil rights) was rejected because it was not timely enough. I am currently appealing on an appeal to have the timely filing requirement waived."44516.6513888889 Unfortunately, given the time delay and the fact that the statute of limitations has expired I do not believe that you have a case against the university. 44522.8347222222 Is there anything I can do about this matter.44552.8409722222 Workers have few rights in the workplace and dr apt privileges are not one of them, in most cases.

He wasn't suspended but he can't be on campus. The school said they ate willing to take the risk of litigation when u told them they could be sure.

They gave me no pamphlet for alternative options, although they know he can't do distance learning due to his disabilities, as he was only able to attend a few days when they closed the school down for covid, he experienced so much learning loss and still is.

TERM0TERM0###689701 reported that she witnessed unprofessional behavior by multiple ### staff.  TERM0TERM0###689701 also reported that a ### employee asked her who she was and then told her â€œYou arenâ€™t essential. Get out.â€ TERM0TERM0###689701 left the OR and went back to the nurses station. TERM0TERM0###689701 stated to TERM02###45 ### (when they talked later) that she was very upset about how she was treated. She told TERM02###45 that she went back to the ### nurses station and told them what happened. TERM0TERM0###689701 told TERM02###45 that the ### nurses made excuses about what happened and TERM0TERM0###689701 kept on going and disagreeing with those excuses.  TERM0TERM0###689701 stated to TERM02###45 that the whole thing was wrong and if something is wrong or she is mistreated she will speak up for herself. Later that day clinical instructor TERM0###155 called TERM02###45 and stated that TERM0TERM0###689701 didnâ€™t go to TERM0###155 when the incident happened but she had heard that TERM0TERM0###689701 was upset from other students because TERM0TERM0###689701 had posted on the students Facebook page that she needed TERM02###45â€™s number. TERM0###155 then found TERM0TERM0###689701 and spoke to her. The following day ### TERM0###155 reported to TERM02###45 that two ### nurses approached her at different times during the day to let her know how unprofessional TERM0TERM0###689701 was after she came back to the ### desk including â€œshe told us what she thought of all of usâ€. The nurses reported to TERM0###155 that they tried to ### her about what happened and that it was not directed at her and she would not listen and kept on about how awful all Regional employees are. On ### I (### TERM0###620) and TERM02###45 ### met with TERM0TERM0###689701 who brought her husband with her. We gave TERM0TERM0###689701 the opportunity to tell us again what happened from her point of view. We let TERM0TERM0###689701 know that even though she was unhappy with how she perceived that she was treated it was unprofessional and disrespectful to talk the way she did to the nurses at the nurses station. I reminded TERM0TERM0###689701 of the Professional Standards of Conduct agreement that she signed and referred to the â€œNursing Student Misconduct in Professional Behaviorâ€ policy both of which TERM0TERM0###689701 acknowledged that she knew about. I let TERM0TERM0###689701 know that her actions violated the following:  ###. Respect for oneself others and the rights of privacy and confidentiality  5. Respectful behavior in interpersonal relationships with peers superiors clients and their families.During this meeting TERM0TERM0###689701 repeatedly stated that she did not feel she did anything wrong stating that the ### nurses at the nursing station asked her how it went and â€œI am an open and honest person and if someone asks me something Iâ€™m going to tell them how I feelâ€.  Both TERM02###45 and I stressed that it is critical to be professional and respectful in her reply and that this is where the main problem is. We also reminded TERM0TERM0###689701 that she is representing USD while there and that if she is mad about something she needs to go talk directly to her instructor in a private setting and professional manner. After saying this TERM0TERM0###689701 said â€œI wasnâ€™t madâ€.  I paused and said â€˜TERM0TERM0###689701.. really? What you are telling us makes it sound like you were madâ€. TERM0TERM0###689701 then said â€œIâ€™m not mad.. Iâ€™m annoyedâ€ TERM0TERM0###689701 then picked up her bag stood up and said â€œnow you are being disrespectful and unprofessional to me by laughing at meâ€. I assured TERM0TERM0###689701 that I was not laughing at her. TERM0TERM0###689701 (and her husband) repeatedly stated that TERM0TERM0###689701 did nothing wrong as she â€œanswered their questions about how it wentâ€.  TERM0TERM0###689701 does not feel that she did anything wrong and does not feel that she should â€œbe written upâ€.

It is hard to understand the game when you know the rules and everyone says we really can't talk about it.This a has happened before and the case is attached. She was also kicked out of the program and sued the college and the jury sided with her on the program.Hopefully when you have the discussion with ### ### she will understand the how ### as a student with this situation. I have given both the summary of the case and also attached the complete opinion of some ###. On the one hand you as a student trying to comply with the taught protocols to know what are and report  unsafe practices  and on the other hand you it appears you cannot report these practices for fear you you would be thrown out of the nursing program for reporting it. Is there some other way or hospital  where you can do the internship or externship or your ###  so you  complete your nursing training.  43504.1159722222 I am a USD school of nursing student in Rapid City. On ###th ###. ###. ### Get out of the OR NOW as I was not essential!" I did have permission as a student to be in the OR at this time. I left the OR and ended up lost in the hospital. I found my way back to the labor and delivery nurses desk and they asked "How did it go?" I replied "Well honestly I dont know I was kicked out of the OR and I will be reporting this to my professor." The nurses responded 'Well you go ahead and do that and you will have a target on your back the rest of the time you are here." One of these nurses was a previous boyfriend of mine's mother. (We had a bad break up after marriage proposal and she severly dislikes me.)" I reported the situation to the clinical instructor then my advisor which is USD protocol. I was then told I had to have a "meeting" to discuss my unprofessional behavior." I was met with ### to write me up prior to hearing my side of the situation- as ### the nursing school handbook." I did not as I referred to it. I was laughed at by one professor and told I 'need to shut my mouth because me speaking up is compromising the contract they have with the hospital" I have proof this ### has blatantly lied on University Documents laughed at me in the meeting (my husband was with me) and I am refusing to sign the papers to write me up and be put in my permanent file. Only to be met with "you can be expelled from the nursing program." The decision to write me up did not follow proper university protocol and it was a prejudiced decision made by false allegations. I need legal help as my future at USD is being threatened by use of ### me as a student by threatening to kick me out of the program and writing me up. I have plenty of documentation that will aid in my burden of proof against the University staff.  I do have a skype meeting with ### ### the President of the Nursing Department in Vermilion to discuss this situation. I am mostly concerned with being written up unlawfully and possibly being kicked out of the program for speaking up against the ### that I have witnessed.I am unable to attach the documents necessary as your program says they are "too large"."43503.8097222222 I thought the University of South Dakota  medical administration had a contract with the ### Administration Center in Fort ###, but maybe that is only with students attending medical school.I find it interesting the suggestion you are compromising the schools contract with the hospital.If this is true, then they should teach you what is in the contract the nursing school has with the hospital. If you are not suppose to comment on what you see then they should teach you what is the protocol you are suppose to follow. What is in the schools contract with the hospital that requires you to sign an academic misconduct or be kicked out of the program. You are student there to learn and failing sometimes is a price of learning.   Can't you do your clinical in one of the other hospitals they have a contract say in some other hospital they have a contract  43504.2125 Thank you for your response. Regional hospital is the only hospital here that we do clinicals at. I was told by reporting this I was compromising the schools contract with the hospital." Unfortunately in our area there is only one other nursing school I can attend if I am kicked out of USD. I honestly hope that with your help and reference to this specific case Dr ### will retract the accusations.  If I sign the academic misconduct  I will be admitting guilt. Yet I believe if I dont sign it they will push to have me kicked out. Thanks again### ###"43504.1361111111 Thanks for the update. The most important take away from this is to see if you can stay in the program and somehow finish or graduate. It is confusing that you would be told you are permitted  to view a surgery and then go to the surgery room and then told you were not essential and get out.No question no student is ever  essential to the surgery, why were you invited to attend. It almost sounds like you were never suppose to be able to view the surgery. Of course isn't this part of the clinical to  view these situations so you can know what to do should it happen to you. This is something you had no control over and shouldn't be held accountable for the conduct the medical staff in the surgery room. The remainder of the discussion appears to be communication issues mishaps  who you can or should talk to and and who you should not talk too and what you can say and what you cannot say. This is more proving who said what and what was really said. Figuring out what really happened and what is the truth is usually a long contentious path and thousands of hours of court time has been used and  sometimes there is no end to figuring out what happen. When these communication mishaps happen, all you can really do is say I made a mistake in saying anything other than I should have said it was interesting".You would do things different if you could go back and start over on this matter. if you were going to say anything bad about it that you should have talked to ### in closed door session instead of talking at the nurses station or to other students. This is a what the ### and learning ethics  or professionalism is about what you say and what you can say to the patients to other people you work with  and everything else in the medical field. We have all kinds of rules about it HIPPA."43504.6520833333 Hello, ###.I am a college faculty member as well as a Va attorney.I don't see that the two policies are in conflict, as the Nursing manual incorporates the VCCS/Reynolds policy. Where do you think there is a discrepancy?You said a formal hearing is upcoming. The rules for formal hearings are set out in the VCCS/Reynolds policy and it says you have a student rep on the formal hearing committee.You have to be proactive and assert your right to have the committee made up exactly as it says in the policy. If you don't assert your right, you can't wait for them to mess up and then appeal. But if they refuse the makeup per the policy then you have grounds to appeal the formal hearing.Similarly, anything else they do incorrectly may affect the outcome and provide grounds for appeal but you have to protest when it happens.You refer to appeal in the last part of your question...but you aren't there yet if you have not had a formal hearing.But an appeal is not a rehearing...it is only to assert that something was done wrong procedurally at your formal hearing and the burden is on you to show that it was and that it would have made a difference in the outcome. Read the rules on appeals carefully.You also have the right to have an attorney present at the formal hearing, though he/she cannot ask questions. He/she can make certain that all is done right and help you with grounds for appeal. I don't know of any in the area, and you are against a time crunch as ### is Tuesday but perhaps the ### Bar Association could help you with a referral.As for the merits, nursing programs are required by accrediting bodies to have very high standards of academic honesty as they think it predicts professional integrity and ethical behavior.I can't advise you on the specifics and what to do except to say tell the truth. You only make it worse if you don't, as you have already not been honest at the informal meeting.It does appear that they have grounds to think you did copy the materials and give them to an incoming student...it was not your call to think that a new teacher would not use that material. In fact, many courses and materials are used by different instructors.In short, study the procedures, know your rights, assert your rights at the beginning of the hearing, tell the truth, get an attorney to come with you if you can, and hope for the best.43228.8131944444 I am currently enrolled at JSRCC in the nursing program. It has came to my attention that the school recently got evidence that I sent an email with test answers to a peer. The instructor that taught my class had left all of the test questions, answers, and feedback online in the Blackboard website for the entire ### (Although we were only able to see them for thirty minutes after our proctored exam). The professor was leaving the class, and moving on to teach another class. My understanding was that I was sending study guides for my peer since a new teacher was coming on for her semester. I had a meeting with the ### on ###/### (She stated I would be contacted by student services). This never happened, I was then contacted by the program director to come to a meeting on ###/###. Upon meeting with the director she showed me the email that was sent and the documents provided for which I panicked and said I didn't do it. I have now been selected to attend a formal hearing on 5/2. Now that I have had time to think about it I will tell the full story as I have here, but would like to know if you can find any discrepancies in the policies given to me. One policy outlines certain things, the other outlines others. The hearing I am given does not include a student representative, and I feel that I will be un-fairly judged. I am going to attach the policies I have, and hope that you can help in any way. I am doing this step now mostly for the appeals process, but would like to know any information you can give me. Thanks in advance for your time!###43228.8131944444 Child care businesses are licensed by the ### Department of Social Services.  You need to call them to make a complaint.43228.8131944444 Hi, I see an ongoing pattern of inadequate care at my child day care KinderCare in ### VA, so far there been to cases the first one she was sick going to school but when we pick her up she had a temperature of ###. The second one was assaulted by another kid she was kick in the chest and there was still no phone call to let the parents know even when the child have a history of asthma, I am see a pattern of inadequate care at this facility and before my child or any other person child get hurt I would like to know what legal action I can take thank you for your time.43228.8131944444 ###,I have been in practice for ###/or who have claims against their schools as part of my practice.  Whether you obtain a lawyer is often an economic decision based on whether the lawyer is likely to add sufficient value to the case, and whether the cost of the lawyer's services provide a justify hiring him or her.  The difficulty is that with a purely disciplinary action, the student or parents typically must pay out-of-pocket for the lawyer's services, while if the lawyer represents the student in pursuing a legal claim against the school the representation can be on a contingency fee basis, where the lawyer is paid from the amounts recovered, or a fee-shifting statute where the school pays for the student's legal fees.  Based on the facts you provided, you may need a lawyer both to defend a disciplinary action, and to bring a claim against the school.  I recently represented a high school student who faced a similar issue--the school actually segregated the student at the beginning of a school day, claiming it was for his own protection, then interrogated him, yet did not inform the parents that the student was in any danger until the end of the school day.  The parents are actually fighting to change that policy now.  I would need to know more information to evaluate the claims against the school and the defenses to any disciplinary action.  A very important piece of information is whether the school is public or private.  Public school students have more protections than do private school students with regard to discipline.  In addition, the student's age, and the specific details regarding how the official determined the drink was suspicious, whether the official was trained, and what other information he or she possessed in making the decision.  Public school students have Constitutional protections that determine whether a school can discipline a student.If you would like, you can provide more information through this email portal, or you can call me at (434)### x3.  I am happy to discuss all of this with you so you can figure out how best to manage the situation.### ###43228.8159722222 Hello, thank you, it is a public school, they smelled his drink to determine that it contained cough syrup, no one in the school office is trained to distinguish between a flavored drink vs. a flavored drink with cough syrup.

The official who pulled him out smelled the drink and said it contained cough syrup/codeine and referred to his drink as lean". They said that he had been drinking it and appeared groggy with dilated pupils. He asked them to test it and was told he didn't want that because it would involve the police  he said he did if it proved the drink was just kool aid.  He then asked them to call me they refused. I was notified at 3:17pm and I immediately took my son to hospital to make sure he was ok and for a drug screening. It came up negative.  They are now testing the drink but have him suspended until a hearing before the school board superintendent with a referral for expulsion. I had the associate principal describe his drink and it matched with the kool aid he drinks without any substance added (Hawaiian punch polar blast a teal ### blue in color) If they thought my son had ingested and unknown amount of cough syrup which can be lethal why did they not notify me immediately and can they refuse to call me when he asks?"43228.8159722222 Both mother's have a teenage daughter that attds this high school.

The Constitution of ### vests school boards with supervisory authority over the schools in a given school district. This authority extends to whether, and under what circumstances, a person may enter onto school property.  That said, the school board may have procedures/policies for appealing a school decision.

And constant oss makes me miss work and Iâ€™ve discussed thiis with them.Just wish I could homeschool honestly43228.8159722222 Ms. ###,I am sorry to hear that your son is experiencing this.  Bullying can be very difficult to deal with.  My first recommendation would be to thoroughly document (in a notebook or something) every instance where your son is being bullied.  Note dates, times, people, locations, and whether any teachers were notified. I recommend telling a teacher/the principle about every instance and documenting that you told them (emailing them or taking notes about phone conversations).  Take pictures if there are any injuries.  Then, with that,  you can go to the school board, which has authority over all the schools within its district.  I have attached the school board's procedures and form for reporting bullying.

You have to follow it to the letter, and so do they. Your first step is certainly not with the school ###. So go to the school or school board office and get their complete set of regulations and rules.If he has suerved his suspended time and nothing further is to come of it, I suggest you just let it go for now.A lawsuit is not going to serve any purpose at this stage.In response to your comments about your being called, etc., this is a common practice of not notifying the parents. They also interrogate your son without you knowing and this is ok under their rules.I am not saying this is right, but I do a lot of these cases and I know how they work.If the time has passed for any hearings (again you have to get the rules and they should have sent you a letter with info about the process) and your son was not expelled, I would let it play out at this time.If you want to do more, you should find an attorney who specializes in education law.I hope this helps.Thank you for using this service.43242.6173611111 My ### ###. I was not notified of any incident until the end of the school day when I went to pick him up. The assistant principal told my husband our son made inappropriate gestures with a banana.  I went in and was told he threatened to shoot staff and students and because of who we are and where we are from" they have no choice but to believe he would follow through. That was the statement from the assistant principal. I feel this is discrimination based on our color and feel if he truly made that threat I would have been notified immediately the police would have been involved and there would have been other steps taken. I dont feel like a student would be suspended rather expelled in that matter. I also dont feel they would have allowed him to stay in the building. I have been given the runaround trying to get in touch with the superintendent. We just moved here from Colorado a month ago so it's not like they actually know him and he has never been in trouble at school before. He has stood by his word that what they are claiming did not happen. Based on the several different stories we have been told I believe he is being targeted and I need to know how to proceed. Should I file a lawsuit on discrimination? How do I get this best resolved?

Testing as reviewed by an independent education consultant on Autism we brought explained the testing results and how they impacted our son. He returned and Same thing happened. We met before middle school. He started middle school and everything we and our child expressed concern with started again. No one is listening to us, our son or the Drs.

I had no idea that, shows that knowledge is really the key to things. Thanks so much! I was typing the above very quick. So when it comes to my rights or my childs violated, were they? Also my child just started the new school. So how many days do I have to get the info. from the old school? She obviously is also in a new grade, this bus incident happened about ###. Is it a limit on years or days as to when I can get what you requested? Meaning is it a way that my request can somehow be denied? Once again my kid is no longer at the school and this didn't happen this school year. Furthermore, when it came to us moving, I read that a certain paper was to be requested from the school. It wasn't though. So can a principal or school worker for this matter, simply ask for whatever paperwork they want, at whatever time of the school year? I feel as though my child w all her Adhd, Odd, Etc. should have legally had other options when it came to switching schools; and w her also having issues adjusting she possibly should even have just been allowed to simply finish this school year out; then switch to the ### school at the start of next school year. I just didn't know what my legal rights were, so once again without knowing, my hands were tied. As stated all this happened in ### Va. Do you know of a website that I can pull up that shows parents overall rights in schools when it comes to ### children?

Recommend you use simple plain language to explain what you seek and continue your current success by creating your documents yourselves.     Your letter need not be written by a lawyer since its not a contract, its not for use in a legal matter---certainly a grad student or student who has experience working in an office setting can assist.  If outside lawyers get involved in your petition then its not really a student movement anymore---it would be a movement driven by outside lawyers....that would water down your credibility IMHO.  Perhaps an ### network can assist with providing your student group legal guidance if legal problems arise.A school is unlikely to expel anyone for a mere petition.43987.4729166667 Hello, I am asking this question on the behalf of the ### University Student Body. Recent events and other cumulating frustrations have led to us asking for the retirement or resignation of our schools President ### R ###. For several reasons, we believe that our administration has been neglecting student safety and needs in favor of their own personal interests.  We would also like to see a Restructuring  of our entire administration. In a petition created ###, over ###,### ###. This represents 35% of our student population (4,293). Now that we are confident that we have a strong backing, we would like to move towards the next steps of writing a formal letter to the administration and board of trustees that lists our complaints as well as our demands. However, we do not have the experience to write a letter that will be taken seriously and professionally. We also are asking for legal guidance regarding possible retribution from the school board. While we have taken several steps to ### our ###, we are still nervous that the school may find out and try to expel us. Along with help writing a formal letter, we would like advice out what our legal rights are if this were to occur. Our petition can be found here: http://chng.it/r6CGZVbP.  We also have several more complaints that could not fit into the petition that we would like to discuss. 43987.2493055556 Dear Ms ### ###,I am not sure what you are wanting help with?   You want to sue UCR for discrimination---but you did not mention anything discriminatory.   They did not help you in some way you feel they should have--you description was 'what my school was doing'....we don't know what they did except that you are disputing the ###?  I think?   Can you detail what happened with the finances a bit more?If you are thinking of suing UCR, you will need to sue in California courts with California lawyers, not ### courts with ### lawyers. 44054.7430555556 Hello,I hope this email finds you well. I know things are pretty ### right now and that your most likely busy so I truly apologize for bothering you. However, I have run out of options and donâ€™t know what else to do the stress that UCR has created in my life has affect me so much that i was diagnosed with ### shortly after. I was a student at UCR from ######. However the school year of ######  I started facing difficulties so I reached out to all my professors and the CHASS ### and Associate ### of CHASS and financial aid and explained my situation as well as provided doctors notes and evidence. Each one of them acted in an unprofessional way. None bothered to help me and instead discriminated against me. I was disabled and pregnant during that same school year and ended going labor early. I was a single mother and I had zero support from the school. FAFSA had covered for all my three quarters at UCR that school year and I know this because I have spoken to both customers service representatives of ### grant and FAFSA and explained to them what my school was doing they were extremely upset and gave me numbers of high uppers in ###ifornia that could help me. I donâ€™t have money to pay the remaining balance in my student account even took out a student loan to pay back UCR. The issues i been facing is that i get told something different every time in financial aid, i do what they say and it back fires and then they say because i did that i owe money. For the winter quarter, I had just given birth to my daughter and had an emergency C-section and my recovery was terrible and slow and I couldnâ€™t drive from ### to ### which is a ###. I filed appeals to withdraw and provided doctors notes and they were denied. For that reason, financial is saying I owe them money. Even after they put my account on hold so that I could not drop or add classes and when i did drop classes they punished me for it. My doctor even faxed them letters addressing my conditions. 44054.6826388889 I tend to agree with you---but you are going to need a California Education law attorney to review ALL your documents, ALL the emails, ALL the circumstances, timelines, dates, etc. to determine best way froward. 44055.0243055556 I wasnâ€™t asking for special treatment because I get it was my problem if I got pregnant but having an emergency ### and taking three months of recovery and not being able to do anything without assists was something i couldnâ€™t control. If i had doctors excusing me from my classes and asking to allow for to do my homework from home I feel like they should have allowed it or created some plan. From my understanding they could have done a delay in grade meaning when i was better I could ### the classes or make up the work i missed. I know if this because I knew others who had gotten that and my advisor had told me to ask for this but if was denied. 44054.8583333333 Thank you so much I truly appreciate it. I will gather my things and find a California Education Law Attorney. Thank you for your time and help.thank you,Faviola 44055.0972222222 Well i know under the Title ###, i should been allowed to make up work and my absence should have been excused especially since I had doctors and had provided them not only to financial aid but my professors. They should have worked with me after giving birth by allowing me to make the work knowing I could not attend classes and had doctors notes addressing that issue as well as it excuses me from it, and if they werenâ€™t going to do that they should allowed me to drop those classes but instead they didnâ€™t and had my account on hold when i didnâ€™t owe them any money at that time.  Because of that quarter and my failing those classes since I was unable to attend or drop the classes they are saying I have to pay out of pocket for those classes.When I had spoken with financial aid before the quarter started letting them know I was not going to be able to attend classes and they told me to figure it out but yet other students who said they were just having a hard to adjusting not only did the professor and financial aid work with them but they were able to withdraw. I hope this makes more sense itâ€™s hard to explain over text. 44054.8506944444 Hello,I am a student at ### University. Recently, I have been emailed by the school with a notice of alleged violation. I have been charged under the Standard of Student Conduct; specifically, aiding and abetting, helping a student violate the Standards. A conduct conference has been set up for me.The situation is that my roommate had a cat in our apartment which breaks the Standard of Student Conduct. I have already explained the situation with the cat and I also explained I no longer live in that apartment. I have not lived in this apartment since ###th. I went back briefly on ###th to move items out of this apartment; my name is still listed under the apartment because my exemption form has not yet been reviewed. Not only were the schoolâ€™s rules broken, but the leasing companyâ€™s rules were also broken.My future housing with the school is at risk as well as an exemption form for the spring semester 2021. Iâ€™m not sure if I can take legal action but I need help. If I lose housing at my university, I lose everything. 44223.75 Hello.Wow, I have never heard of such a thing, and I am a college professor.You must see what the rules are for having a hearing/contesting this/presenting a defense and do so. I cannot believe they would kick you out of school housing for this. But if they did, you should demand that they give you your money back so you can find a place to live off campus.Present all the facts and impress upon them that they should treat you justly. I don't know what their reason would be to deny you student housing for something like this.I wish you the best.Thank you for using this service. 44224.0576388889 Good Afternoon!I am writing on behalf of a parent attached to the ### Beach Public School system. Your assistance with a point of clarification is appreciated,  regarding who can attend meetings relative to the discussion of the child's special education eligibility, service provision etc.  In this particular case,  the parent was unable to attend the meeting, sharing in advance with school officials that her work schedule would not allow her to be off at the time they identified and that she sought to have representation that ### the child daily educationally and represents her interest. The representative's contact information was shared with the school and the Google Meet invite shared with the representative. Upon the meeting convening, the school indicated they could not move forward with the discussion as there was no disclosure from the parent for the representative to be present. Unfortunately, the school had not apprised the mother that a disclosure form for the representative was needed. Therefore  the school  then sent the form to the parent requesting signature and rescheduling the meeting for the next day with the form signed and returned.  Upon the convening of the rescheduled meeting, the next day with the disclosure form signed and the meeting set to move forward with the school sharing they had received the consent, the school pivoted their guidance sharing that the parent had to be present with the representative for the meeting.The school  indicated that the mother's representative could not attend the meeting in lieu of the parent only with the parent, citing the following: Regulations Governing Special Education Programs for Children with Disabilities .  In reviewing the document for the parent I did not see this language, but wanted guidance as to whether the school was in compliance with the parent's rights.   The parent's scheduling  in attending the meeting during the day and time the school had set,  was very difficult. Requests to adjust the meeting time were not honored by the school.  As a solution, the mother apprised the school in advance of the representative attending the meeting on her behalf.  Yet, the school disallowed this referencing the aforementioned regulation.  Is there something in the regulation the school cites that states that even with a signed disclosure the parent has to attend the meeting with the representative? Your assistance with this matter is greatly appreciated! 44265.7888888889 Hi there EC, and thanks for your question. There are several things in here that are troubling to me, but the biggest is that the school is required to make every effort to accommodate the parent's attendance, and in order for them to hold a meeting without the parent, they must document their efforts to convince the parent that they should come. Obviously this particular parent knows she should come and wants to come, and the issue appears to primarily be scheduling. Thus, I think that there is a good chance the school has failed in its obligations under IDEA. Specifically, I would refer them to the following section (### added by me for clarification): ###.F.R. Â§ ###00.###(a) Public agency responsibilityâ€”general. Each public agency must take steps to ensure that one or both of the parents of a child with a disability are present at each IEP Team meeting or are afforded the opportunity to participate, includingâ€”(###) Notifying parents of the meeting early enough to ensure that they will have an opportunity to attend; and(###) Scheduling the meeting at a mutually agreed on time and place.â€¦(c) Other methods to ensure parent participation. If neither parent can attend an IEP Team meeting, the public agency must use other methods to ensure parent participation, including individual or conference telephone calls, consistent with Â§###00.######8 (related to alternative means of meeting participation).(d) Conducting an IEP Team meeting without a parent in attendance. A meeting may be conducted without a parent in attendance if the public agency is unable to convince the parents that they should attend. In this case, the public agency must keep a record of its attempts to arrange a mutually agreed on time and place, such asâ€”(###) Detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls;(###) Copies of correspondence sent to the parents and any responses received; and(###) Detailed records of visits made to the parentâ€™s home or place of employment and the results of those visits.â€¦If you send this section to the school board with a notice that the parent wishes to attend the IEP meeting and that the times scheduled do not work for her, and suggesting some other times that do, the school will need to figure out a way to make this work. Sadly, raising this to the school will flag for them that this parent knows her rights and the school will usually comply once they realize that. However, there is always a chance they won't.If they do not come around, then the parent may need counsel. I understand that this school in in ### Beach. I am in ###, but if things are proceeding virtually I would be happy to jump in and throw my weight around a bit. I have found that once a lawyer is involved, schools that were reluctant to do it right get their ducks in a row. Annoying, but true. Just let me know. Finally, the parent has a right to bring a friend or representative with her, but it is generally not contemplated that a representative who is not an attorney could attend WITHOUT a parent. These meeting are really set up for parent involvement and the school should bend over backwards to make it happen in a case like this where the parent clearly wants to be present. I hope this helped and answered the questions you and the parent had. Please feel free to reply here if you have additional questions or need any clarification. Also, please let me know if the school does not comply. I can easily send a letter that usually straightens thing up right quick. You have ###. Thanks, and Good Luck!44288.5951388889 I requested an amendment to my sonâ€™s student record as per the ### due to inaccurate coding of the discipline incident being coded as obscene language/gesture. It was deemed to be misleading by the principal but he is changing it to now reflect, â€œHorse playingâ€ - under Rule 6: Disruption - defined as rough or noisy play or ###s, running in hallways or other areas. This will now be reflected as a ###. My son did not do a ### or horse playing. My ### - is the code of the infraction able to just be changed to something else when I was able to prove the code of conduct that he was supposedly in violation of was inaccurate and misleading? If I was able to prove my sonâ€™s innocence to the accusation why would the whole situation not just be withdrawn and/or dropped completely? If so, the next step to this process is a hearing, could you provide me with assistance/knowledge on how to approach the school board to dissolve this incident entirely since Iâ€™ve been granted both the appeal and amendment by the principal of the school. I have responded to the principalâ€™s asking questions and he has failed to reply since 3/19. I wIâ€™ll be following up on my email today asking him again for a reply since I need to request a hearing if this isnâ€™t normal standards of an amendment. Since the initial date of this incident, ###, I have several emails between myself, the principal as well as several others within the Office of School Leadership, Office of Student Leadership and the Clerk of the School Board, however, I do not know how to include them in this question. I also have asked for proof of the research/investigation from the principals to show what lead them to labeling this incident as â€œobscene language/gestureâ€ originally, and have yet to receive anything. Lastly, this so-called incident involved ###.My son has never had any disciplinary issues. The teacher involved has personally told my son if she would have known the details to the TikTok video this incident was based off of this situation would have never become this big commotion. Since ###, due of the accusations/handling of this situation my son has been affected mentally. He went from a school spirited, spunky student to now really disliking school. I ultimately feel like the principal overreacted to the situation and instead of admitting that he blew the situation out of proportion, he wants to put label on it as something of some sorts. This would have not been brought to adminâ€™s attention had the teacher known there wasnâ€™t any â€œsexual overtonesâ€ to it. ** I believe by making the emails available to this question it will help to give a better understanding/explanation to this situation. Please advise me how to make those available for you as this is my first time ever using this platform. Thank you **44279.64375 I inquire the legitimacy of whether my college, a public school, can make COVID ### mandatory for incoming students. As a graduating senior, I will be attending the University of Massachusetts in the fall. Due to the personal ### on the safety of a vaccine authorized under haste, my preference is not to be vaccinated. I learned earlier today that the University of Massachusetts made COVID vaccination mandatory for on campus students in the fall, and without a clear medical/belief exempt I will not be eligible to attend the University physically for the fall semester.As I read the laws on immunizations for the State of Massachusetts, I am aware that the COVID vaccine is not listed as a requirement by the state. As I read the FDA's instruction for Emergency Use Authorization, I believe that the FDA's guideline is for the EUA product to be completely voluntary. My question is as follows:###) Can the University of Massachusetts, a public university, legally mandate the COVID vaccine and deny unvaccinated students' physical entrance to the campus?###) If the school's decision cannot be altered, will there be a possibility for me to attend physically without COVID vaccination? (For example, making myself eligible for the medical/belief exemption clause). Please also enlighten me upon the procedure to file a civil lawsuit in the response if there is no possibility for me to attend the school without vaccination for COVID. Thank you and wish you well. 44309.8340277778 Two clarifications:###) the entire dispute is surrounding the COVID vaccine, I am willing to and have received vaccinations for all mandatory immunizations. ###) The â€œState mandated immunizationsâ€ is refereeing to state required immunizations for public middle schools and universities44309.8555555556 I am a first year PA student at ### and ### College School of Health Sciences in ### county, ### ###.  The dismissal was based upon the alleged egregious violation of the physician assistant program policies regarding academic integrity. I was not offered due process and a fair hearing. I attended the student progression committee hearing on Tuesday ###th, ###. I was only told that the topic of discussion would be regarding academic integrity" but they did not present me with any evidence or accusations regarding the charges. From that meeting the faculty members in the committee unanimously voted for dismissal. After appealing to the program director and appealing further to the Graduate Healthcare Academic Standards Committee (the final level of appeal) on ###st unfortunately the program still upheld their final decision of dismissal. I previously retained an attorney who helped with writing the last appeal but I currently do not have a lawyer. The ### criteria for decision-making is a preponderance of evidence (the only evidence presented was a text message exchange with a friend that they believe is sufficient evidence that proves attempted cheating). There were no procedural standards for this case matter in the program handbook policies that provides grounds for my dismissal. I have not cheated for the exam and I do not possess any unauthorized information that could be used for the exam. There is clear and convincing evidence of cheating taking place in the class and although I have brought it up with faculty and the program director no actions were taken place to ensure student disciplinary actions are applied equally across student body. I have proof that after my dismissal changes were made to their student handbook regarding the appeals process and SPC hearings. I will attach the pdf copy of the current ### handbook policies before they made changes below. My goals in pursuing this case is not for reinstatement in this institution as I understand the final decision for my dismissal has already been finalized. If possible I would like assistance in possibly getting the academic violation or conduct charges against me dismissed by the university administration or to negotiate a stipulated confidential withdrawal from the school in order to preserve eligibility for future applications to other PA programs and graduate programs.  I would like to know if you or anyone in your firm is able to  provide advice on my case and which direction I should go.  I can discuss my case details further by phone. I really appreciate your help."44335.8569444444 Hello.Here is the ### Code section that governs your question.https://law.lis.###.gov/vacode/title8.01/chapter2/section8.01-15.1/You need to contact the clerk of the circuit court to find out their procedure for filing a motion and getting an order to allow it.I hope you find this helpful.Thank you for using this service. 44376.7472222222 I have drafted a complaint to file suit against a ### State University but I would like to remain anonymous. How do I file to remain anonymous?44371.8305555556 Due to a University's breach of contract, I lost a scholarship valued up to $###. But to be fair, I was able to transfer many of my credits to another University. How do I determine quantity of monetary damages to sue for dollar for dollar so I can calculate the filing fee? Thank you!44371.8354166667 Ms. ###,In theory, your damages in a breach of contract is the measure in how you much worse off you are after the breach as compared to if the defendant had not breached the contract.  So, for example, suppose you contract with Mr. X to sell you a piano for $1,000; Mr. X breaches the contract; and the only piano you can find of the same quality is being sold for $###.  In that case your damages would be $500-- because you are $###.As I understand your case, the university breached a contract to provide you a subsidized tuition and you have now transferred to a new institution.  Presumably without the first university's scholarship, your tuition ### has increased substantially.  Your damages would be the difference between your total tuition cost at your new university versus what the tuition would have been at the first university absent the breach.  If you incurred moving or other transition costs that might also be recoverable.I hope this answers your question.  44371.8472222222 Sounds like a ### theory to me.   In order to prove it up at trial, you might need an expert witness-- but at least at the pleading stage (where you are right now) I believe it would be appropriate to include that in your initial damages calculations.44371.8715277778 Thank you Volunteer Attorney. Would the Court consider the fact that a degree from a less reputable school damages my lifetime earning potential?44371.8506944444 Hello,I was an out of state student for a school in ###, my final semester before going to my internship, this school tried ###. One was said that I didnâ€™t complete an assignment ( which I did), the second was to say that I was terminated from my site ( proved that I was not), and third was to say at my site had unethical/ unprofessional behavior ( which also false). backstory: I went to my site, I finished my hours early 100+ hours. Neither in the student handbook, The contract or anywhere did the documents say that I had to remain at my site once the hours were completed. I took the job at the site, and decided today leave the site because I did not like the environment. I had one more assignment, I asked my professor if there is anything else I could do, my professor tells me to go back to my site to do the assignment. I go back to my site for my assignment, four days later my teacher tells me that I would get a no pass for not completing the assignment because I would be under academic review. Here is the tricky part. My professor had stated she went to department chair, and department advisor about my case prior to my academic review. The people who appeal my case are the same professors who reviewed my case prior to the academic review, so once my academic review was on their desk they had already had knowledge and opinion about my case. I was denied. I went up to the ### to appeal, he said it was denied because I only did ###. The ### offered me a scholarship to ### the class. I let the professor know that her vendetta against me for trying to fail me for three times is pretty sad and as a ### college itâ€™s ### to see this kind of behavior three weeks later I get letter saying that I was dismissed from the program for unethical behavior at my site. I am pretty sure they areI spent three years at this school, I am veteran who used GI ### and I am unsure of how to handle this.44419.6055555556 You mention a contract. A breach of contract action, depending on the amount of damages, can be filed in General District Court (under $25k) or Circuit Court (over $15lk). If between those amounts you can file in either GDC or Circuit (they have concurrent jurisdiction" between ### and 25k). In GDC the pleading is called a Warrant in Debt. In Circuit it's called a Complaint. However read the contract. If it requires arbitration you need to go with arbitration.

If the district failed to provide accommodations, you can ask for compensatory education which could be in the form of tutoring or some other form of instruction.  For being locked out of ARDs, this is a procedural violation.  You would need to show that this deprive you of your right to participate in ARD meeting which resulted in a failure to confer education benefit.  Missing official records and disclosing information to a 3rd party without consent would be a ### (violation of educational privacy law)  and not IDEA.  You could file a ### complaint against the district with the Department of Education.  Under ###, it would be very difficult to get damages.  The bottom line is what you son needs to graduate.  If he meet all of the graduation requirements and you are not seeking any relief that would impact his graduation, you could argue that stay put does not apply.  You can raise this at the resolution conference.  If you do not settle your case at the resolution conference, you should argue at the prohearing conference with the hearing officer that stay put should not apply and your son should be allowed to graduate.43977.8611111111 Please call DRTx to see if they can help your son get accommodations at college.

If you want compensatory education for the failure to provide accommodations, you could ask for tutoring over the summer and the ability to redo work with accommodations so he could get a better grade.The issue over the video and recordings are governed by the Family Privacy Education Act (###).  The recordings are educational records.  I am not sure about the video.  It depends on what is being videoed.  The district may argue that the hearing officer does not have jurisdiction over the recordings.  If the hearing officer agrees with the district, you can file a ### complaint.  Good luck!!43978.6381944444 i am sorry but you will not get a hearing officer to find that the district should not receive its federal funds.

Disability Rights Texas has an attorney who is assisting students in getting accommodations at college.  Your son might also be able to receive support from the TWS-VR to help him receive accommodations at college.  You might want to call Disability Rights Texas intake to ask for assistance in getting accommodations for your son at college.

(There are no motions, no subpoenas, etc.) You are allowed to file in General District Court for cases with an amount in controversy no more than $25,000. (If you are see### more than $25,###, which is more complicated.) ### has a general district court manual, if you are curious about the processes.If it eventually comes to suing ### University, you will have to file what is called a Warrant In Debt, Form DC######2 (which is just a fancy way of saying â€œsomeone owes me moneyâ€). On the form, you will have to explain your cause of action and how much you believe you are owed (whatever tuition and fees you paid).### causes of action in this case include breach of contract (e.g., you had an agreement, and the university breached its obligations) or fraud, under an equitable estoppel theory (e.g., the university made material representations to you that it knew or should have known were false, which, in relying on this information, ### you doing something you wouldnâ€™t have done otherwise, and which caused you financial harm). You care allowed to plead more than one cause of action in the same case, so you could allege both.If you do eventually want to sue for your money back, youâ€™ll have to fill out that linked form, bring it to ### General District Court at ###. ### Street, 2nd Floor, ###, VA 23###. You may want to call the clerk of court (###-###, 8:### ###:###) to see whether there are any special procedures during the COVID-###.There will be a filing fee, which varies depending on the court, cause of action, and other factors. Typically, the filing fee will be around $60.The sheriff (or a deputy) will â€œserve processâ€ on the university, announcing to them that theyâ€™re being sued, and then the lawsuit starts.After you file the Warrant In Debt, the university can satisfy their debt to you at any point, and you can tell the court youâ€™ve settled the case and the case will close. If the case ends up going forward, you should expect it will take a few weeks or even months.The court will call a pretrial hearing to set a trial date, you will have to file a â€œ### of particularsâ€ to explain your side of the story, the university will be allowed to file a reply, and then there will be a simple hearing that operates as the trial, and the judge will render judgment. Any evidence that you have, including emails and recordings, could probably be presented at trial.If you want further legal assistance you should probably contact an attorney (you can search FindLaw, for example). If you hire an attorney to represent you on contingency basis, the attorney will want a share of your judgment if you win (customarily the attorney will take ###/###).44463.8131944444 I am expressing my grievance in finding that upon arrival on campus at ### University the Art department no longer existed; therefore, my major was no longer being offered. Upon arrival, we received an itinerary that listed a week's worth of events to get new students ### with their new â€œhome by the seaâ€ and on Tuesday, ###th they scheduled the students to meet with their department heads with their as well as my department listed. In arriving at my location there were signs posted pointing in the direction of my meeting, but when I got there I was met with a dark hall and one lit office with an Art Professor there to inform me that they got rid of the Art department last school year and that my major no longer existed. Then when inquiring about the withdrawal process from Advisors, Administration, and the Business Office I was informed that I would not get a full refund because I did not request a refund back in May, however, I as well as the other students were never told that there was an issue within the department so because of the lack of communication on the Universityâ€™s side we were never afforded with that opportunity. After hearing that, I still chose to formally withdraw Tuesday, ###st, 2021. I have not received the $###,818.### â€œdefinitelyâ€ get back, and not one office has acknowledged my dis-enrollment or my dis-enrollment emails, and I am still showing as a student despite being told that all that would go into effect Sep. ###, 2021. In addition, I believe I am entitled to the $600.###â€™t informed of the department changes until arriving on campus. I feel cheated out of my money and all of the expenses I put into attending this University, not to mention having my time wasted and returning home to being unemployed because I chose to leave my job to further my education at this institution. To make matter worse, they still refuse to update their website to reflect these department changes, so more students could be tricked in the future to apply to this university under the idea of a program that no longer exists. My question is: What are some next steps I can take to get my refund and get properly compensated, and who can I contact to get that help? Along with pictures, I have recorded conversations as well as video evidence.44463.6527777778 Dear Ms. Bethel:I am sorry to hear about your daughter's school suspension.Generally, school principals have the right to question a student without the parent present, unless your local school district requires otherwise.I can check your local school district's rules, if you can provide me with the following information:Please confirm that your school district is the ### Beach City Public Schools?Is your daughter in elementary school?

Last year the school put him on a ###, but the ###. He continues to have problems in social settings, but they say theyâ€™re are no options for a small group setting even though he behaves well when they remove him from the class multiple times a week and place him alone with a teacher or a small group doing individualized work. They are supposed to do small group testing, send home daily behavior logs, and provide a copy of homework for the whole week ahead of time. These things are not being done. This year they have given him multiple referrals in one day more than once due to behaviors specifically outlined in the ###. Now they say he is up for expulsion and does not qualify for special education services. Anytime we ask about what lead to the behavior to try to come up with a resolution, no one seems to do. They just know the teacher called and he needed to be removed from the class. The school psychologist doesnâ€™t know if other parts of the ### (###, breaks, teacher ###) is what will work as there is never any information about these things being used consistently although written into the plan. He is scheduled to have testing for special services done again, but they say that could take up to ###. He is ### 5th grade.

She completely stopped speaking to me over a year ago despite visits calls texts and letters.  My ex has had her in counseling intermittently and my offers to attend have been ignored.

The state of Florida pays her tuition as she was adopted by him in the state of Florida. He cut off her medical insurance and required her to apply for medicaid. While in Utah, she has chosen adoption. I have helped her locate a family that is willing to adopt but he will not allow her to come back to South Carolina for the adoption, he went as far as to text me asking me to tell her that adoption is not an adoption here.

I'm Californian, but my girlfriend, ###, (who lives in South Carolina) is currently facing ### discrimination from the administration at her school. She is trying to form a Gay-Straight Alliance/LGBT club to combat already existing prejudice in her school, but has been met with much resistance from her principal and other members of staff.Despite showing them that she is protected by the law to form such a group (according to the Federal Equal Access Act) due to the presence of other extracurriculars on campus (including a Fellowship of ### Athletes), her club proposal is not being given the same respect as these other clubs. ### was subjected to what I find cruel and unnecessary questioning by many adult staff members as to why she would create such a group and that if she were to form a club, it would need to give just as much attention to straight students, while not being allowed to promote the acceptance of the LGBT community with ### such as the rainbow. She and I both feel that this is contrary to the purpose of the club itself, which is to provide a safe space forI find it appalling that we live in a time where a high ### cannot form a club that ### acceptance due to the close ### views of the school administration. Because of this, I write to you seeking any sort of legal advice and/or resources that you might be able to provide. We know that the law is on our side, we just need help proving it to the school so we can help protect the rights of the LGBT students there. Attached you'll find the club proposal we made that was rejected by her school.

Within a month, she was on intervention for math and literacy. They called a meeting where it was decided to retain her back to 1st grade, thus making it appear that she was at grade level. I then requested an evaluation and was told no. I pushed further and requested a meeting with the district head of special ed. They then agreed to do a ###. At that time, the school created a behavior plan and put it into place. I requested a meeting so that I could be involved with the behavior plan. The school emailed me and stated that she no longer displayed any negative behaviors, so the behavior plan was unnecessary, so they cancelled the meeting. I also have been working with my daughter's pediatrician trying to get her onto a medication for ADHD that works for her. I received the results of the evaluation and there are multiple instances of the school lying to the evaluator which sways the results. The school told him that I insisted the behavior plan be discontinued, which is the opposite of what I wanted. (The evaluator couldn't understand why a plan that was working was stopped.) The school also told him that I took her off the medications because I didn't like the side effects" which was also untrue. Any medication changes that have been made were at the instruction of her doctor. The school also said that there are no behavioral concerns or academic concerns and emails from her teacher as well as her report card show otherwise. I have fought and fought with her school and they have now caused a ###. My daughter is already redoing 1st grade for the 2nd time I don't want to get to the end of the school year again and have them retain her for a 3rd time but she is already not meeting grade level requirements and I want her to be successful. Do I have any legal recourse for the school lying to the evaluator? I know I have some due process violations from the initial evaluation request and them never providing a written response denying the request.

The next day she threatened that she was going to commit suicide and showed the teachers this video and my son has been expelled for the remainder of the year for they are afraid "he cld cause harm to others".

Because Iâ€™ve been pushing them pretty hard for reason and science based data evidence, they arenâ€™t really giving it. We are still trying to get the new IEP implemented because they agreed the one implemented in January was not well written or developed.  We meet Monday ###th to make a joint mediation request and Iâ€™m hoping mediation will help with a mediator.  But they would be willing to pay for me to meet with someone to discuss â€œremediesâ€ before mediation if we can find someone that will.  I think Iâ€™m just not sure what we can ask for thatâ€™s appropriate and reasonable to make up for an entire year.  The issue is their scope should be earlier then January because the reason for the delays had to do with staff behavior causing significant mental health issues with my ptsd.  They claim to have implemented a ton of interventions all year which I believe I can now show didnâ€™t happen and the old case manager actually Lied about, which makes it hard to trust in the team when they canâ€™t even acknowledge this wasnâ€™t all his behaviors.  Heâ€™s still not in the classroom 40% which I was told he needed to be to be considered in a ### Ed placement.  Just a big mess and the legal aid attorney that Iâ€™ve been talking with has been helping with three other issues(I use the ### help loosely) but basically ends up telling me she canâ€™t help with anything so Iâ€™ve had to do a lot for my other son (who was in an unsafe situation with his case manager for a bit) and Iâ€™m hoping to be able to follow up with her ASAP for ### but the school schedules meeting after meeting for all these issues and transitions and it makes it hard to try to engage with legal aid and all the other lawyers offices Iâ€™ve been trying to find help with that I can afford.  So I really appreciate your help, do you have any thoughts on how I can ask for the data to show or support their statements and how to push for it when they donâ€™t give it? Maybe Iâ€™m using the wrong language? 43623.4583333333 ###,No problem, I'm happy to help.  I'd certainly be willing to take a look at their response if it arrives today. With regard to the other issues, unfortunately I think you should probably create a separate question if they stem from a separate matter.  I'd be happy to look at those as well once you do.best,###43593.6673611111 ###- I have been through an administrative complaint, ### for retaliation after my ac was resolved in mediation. I have already followed up with a succinct and all pretty detailed with dates and direct quotes from emails and meeting notes.  Iâ€™ve drafted an AC but Iâ€™m not sure that I know what would be reasonable when someone looks at the evidence and the legal statutes to accept to hel my child. I have PTSD from this districts harassment last time so Iâ€™m struggling to not just agree with them and accept an apology again but itâ€™s May and I have ### who we just got a report finally after almost a full year of trying to get his sensory needs evaluated that shows significant sensory issues in every domain and now Iâ€™m just even more ###. I have an extensive paper trail and the director of student support services is personally involved with both my sons illega(and she agrees) ### at the moment and yet we still have them. Is there a point where the AC is not the right avenue and I should consider a due process hearing?  Because Iâ€™m confident that my past experience has allowed me to prepare and document this year way better and Iâ€™m worried that this will drag out even longer and my son will have lost an entire year to carelessness on their part. Iâ€™m willing to go either route and Iâ€™d be happy to try to do it since I canâ€™t afford an attorney and I havenâ€™t heard back from anyone st legally aid for this issue not my eeoc issue. Do you know where I could find more help on due process vs admin complaint and when itâ€™s best to do them or not do them if you canâ€™t ### a lawyer? Maybe I miss understood the benefit of the ###, I didnâ€™t expect them to agree with my concerns in writing to be honest so Iâ€™m shocked when someone asks me for resolution ideas because they have investigated and are finding in favor of concerns like these at this level.  Should I wait and review the written response language before I engage further informally even? They admit they are going to find this IEP is not well written or adequately developed which feels like a big win but I am thinking I shouldnâ€™t really accept that verbally but what do I do when I read it and they actually admit they violated the law in writing.  I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s appropriate but there is a lot more to this then just the IEP, they are part of the reason I lost my job and needed crisis support for my ptsd and they have admitted they made serious mistakes but I worry by trying to work together for my kids Iâ€™m hurting myself legally unintentionally if I donâ€™t really understand what to do when they get me that documented response. Is there anyone i one I can try to get to review it with me when it comes next week?  Or is that something that would require money to do in any manner probably. 43590.0798611111 ###-I appreciate your response and look forward to hearing your thoughts when you are able.  It feels a little bit ### because so far they have responded to acknowledge my response but itâ€™s with some honest questions about what the point is? And I know she isnâ€™t trying to but she makes a couple remarks in her email today about not being able to respond because of the depth of my response and itâ€™s ###.  She doesnâ€™t have the time and she doesnâ€™t understand the point.  Which I get but in my eyes this has truely caused my kindergarten a lot of added barriers, we still do not have an adequate or new IEP in place yet.  I told her I needed to take some time to process her response and try to connect with someone at legal aid or any other possible ### ASAP but I was also feeling like at a minimum mediation might be the right next step.  Iâ€™ve mediated before, it was terrible but we came out with a significant agreement in the end so I understand the process.  This time I donâ€™t know I feel confident in my understanding of the special ed despite my ### as an advocate for special education and would really like to find some one to attend the mediation with me.  Even just to be a support if they canâ€™t speak.  They already said we could make a joint request before and I donâ€™t know the timelines in terms of connecting with someone at legal aid before then. The director mentioned ### ### as someone she has had experience with that I should try to connect with, I will call again tomorrow or stop in and see what they can help me with, but I would definitely appreciate any thoughts that you have the time to give on the responses.  I had told them I would be in touch by Friday afternoon with an update. Sorry for being so long, just want to be sure I am clear in my communication since I am really struggling with my own mental health and just trying to navigate this as well as I can.Thank you ### ### 43606.1555555556 ###-Thank you so much for your responses, the information was very helpful.  I was supposed to get a response last week but they told me they needed more time because the director was trying to be thorough but had a lot of other things going on.  Which I believe is accurate since I have another more serious situation with my older son in special education and his IEP, and the treatment and behavior I witnessed last week that I was pretty intensely engaged with the director about to address which makes sense that she ran out of time after that. I am hoping to connect with the disability law project lawyer that called me after my intake for the ###-write the rest of ### IEP.  Would it be ok to send you the response just to ### while I am still trying to find legal help with this stuff.  I am not sure if you can access the questions I ask on here besides this one but I am already in the middle of an EEOC complaint for unlawful termination due to disability discrimination and retaliation, and am trying to figure out what to ask specifically at the moment for my 3rd question that will be very similar to this issue with my youngest but I cant even send my older son to school right now and I have tried so hard in both situations with the district and yet again this has happened and cause significant issues with my PTSD, and yet again put our housing at risk.  I know I cant ask you about it and need o do a separate question so Im sorry if even mentioning it is bad or not appropriate.  I'm struggling with trying to engage in communication for all of these that have happened since ###st without shutting down or giving up but things are happening that are not acceptable and without any ability to get legal representation to stop it and I am just doing my best.  I just want my children to have legally appropriate ### and to be safe at school with the supports in place in the ###, so thank you for your advice and responses and I will absolutely continue to try to really connect with someone at legal aid or any lawyers office but I'm not getting anywhere it given the response is coming tomorrow and this new issue with the district, I really appreciate your responses.  I expect to have the response by ### know if I have a timeline for resolution or next steps to respond to them yet either.###43592.66875 Hi ###, Given the fact that, from what youâ€™ve described, there have been severe deficiencies in the ### and execution of your childâ€™s IEP, their ### resolution should address all of the concerns youâ€™ve raised and supply a detailed plan for addressing them going forward.  In preparing to respond to their decision, I think it would be a good idea to try to summarize all of the individual issues you raised in your email (as well as any additional issues) in the form of a numbered list (unless you agree that the ### of issues from the school district in the attached documents are fully comprehensive and accurate).  This will also help you prepare a complaint in the event that you are unable to resolve this issue with them and wish to pursue an administrative appeal with the Vermont Agency of Education (â€œ###â€). If their response is clearly unsatisfactory, youâ€™ll probably want to consider filing a complaint with the state ### sooner rather than later because there is only a one-year period in which to do so.  Youâ€™ll probably want to get a chance to look over their response first, but I can certainly walk you through the process and options regarding state administrative ### in the meantime. Best,### A. ###, Esq.43589.9451388889 Hi ###, Just as a little backstory, I have some background in employment law (mostly with government employees).  Iâ€™ve seen a number of clients ### either lost their jobs because of ### stressors and/or developed ### symptoms from job loss (usually a combination of the two) so I can definitely appreciate the place youâ€™re in, especially because itâ€™s centered around your c###s about your childâ€™s future.Yes, I think youâ€™ll need to weigh the pros and cons of an administrative complaint vs. a due process hearing.  The administrative complaint process will be similar to the ### complaint process you went through.  Essentially, an investigator will be assigned to the case to interview relevant parties, gather information, and assemble a record of investigation.  During the course of the ### process you may have the option of resolving the process through mediation (if the school district also consents to mediation) or the parties may ### mediation and pursue a written decision from the Commissioner of Education based on the findings of the investigation.The due process hearing (as the name suggests) affords you the greatest amount of procedural due process as it provides a hearing which is conducted almost like a ###.  The advantage is that it gives you more of an opportunity to make factual and legal arguments regarding your complaint.  However, it is a more complicated process and you will most likely require the assistance of an attorney to actually take advantage of the upsides of this administrative avenue.If you expect that the school district's written response will come soon, I agree that you should take some time to review it before responding. As far as where you can get additional pro bono legal assistance, my usual suggestion would be the Vermont Legal Aid Disability Law Project, but from what you've told me it seems like you're having trouble getting in contact with them.  I would continue to try to reach out to the Legal Aid Society, but in the meantime I can certainly ### the response once it arrives and give you my input on it.best,###43592.61875 Hi ###,I just wanted to check in again.  Have you gotten a response to your follow-up questions yet and/or any follow-up from legal aid? Also, from a general prospective, have you seen any concrete improvements in services since your latest exchange?  Although they have to remain neutral and are not as helpful as having an attorney or advocate there with you, having a mediator and/or investigator involved may help to break down some of the barriers you're encountering and help parse out the truth of what has been happening, especially with regard to some of their findings that seem to deny or explain away some of your more serious concerns, for example, their findings with regard to your 5th question (apologies for the lengthy cut and paste): 5. You are concerned that the services that were being explained as happening for ### did not happen and were not accurately communicated.  Finding: ###â€™s initial IEP was initiated on ###. Since that time through a review of documentation and data ### has missed services as required by his IEP due to his challenges in engaging in the content and expected academics as well as due to absence. There are days during the year where he has only received ### ### ###-###. Instances of missed services are due to ###â€™s challenging behavioral presentation avoidance behaviors based on his low ### for challenging tasks and absences from school. I am aware you believe that this is in part based on a lack of sensory accommodations or intentional avoidance of services from staff but I did not find evidence that was conclusive of either of these concerns. Subsequently the improvements since the initiation of the IEP have been significant and his access to his classroom and his academic services has jumped significantly. Between ### and ### the data specific to participation in his special education services has improved (a comprehensive review of this data can be available upon your request). Accordingly taken together ### is making adequate progress on his IEP goals and therefore I conclude ### has not been denied."Also have they provided you with a copy of the data that purports to show an improvement in services yet?  I'm available to help with any questions.  I hope all is well.best###"43613.6881944444 Hi ###,I just wanted to check in to see how things are progressing.  Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.best,###43596.5847222222 Hi ###,No problem, definitely keep me updated on ### latest responses.  It's obviously a complicated situation.  The overall goal is to compel them to give your son the services he is entitled to, but the question is what balance of ### vs. stick do want you use to achieve that goal.  As an attorney I would err on the side of recommending that you file a complaint, given the statute of limitations involved, but obviously it's a delicate balance.  Let me know what their follow-up response (if any) is and in the meantime I'll try to put together a more detailed analysis of the situation and what your best options may be.best,###43610.0375 Hi ###,Sorry, I've been a little busy recently.  I've had a chance to at least briefly read their /your responses and I generally agree that they did not seem to fully address your concerns or provide satisfactory answers to certain questions.  I'll delve a little deeper tomorrow when I get a chance and get back to you.best,###43606.1340277778 Hi ###,Yes thatâ€™s problematic that theyâ€™re not giving you the data, given the fact that they said in their response that it would be available at your request.  Itâ€™s possible that theyâ€™re withholding it from you, but itâ€™s also possible that what they had described as data doesnâ€™t really rise to the level of ### evidence (which should be the standard).I would try phrasing your request as broadly as possible in terms of asking for all documentation and evaluations for the period in question.  Hopefully the mediator will also be able to facilitate some more transparency as well.  Also, could you fill me in a little bit more about who they offered to pay to have you meet with to discuss remedies?  In terms of remedies, if theyâ€™re willing to pay for someone for you to meet with, it seems like theyâ€™re ### admitting to a certain extent that theyâ€™ve made some significant mistakes, but you do want to make sure that this person is going to be either advocating on your behalf or be, at the very least, neutral and fair.  Iâ€™m not sure what sort of remedy could truly make up for losing an entire year, but hopefully you can either get monetary ### or other concessions or their part that will help ease the burden moving forward. Best,###43625.8423611111 Hi ###- i was able to connect with legal aid on the other topic but we havenâ€™t been able to even discuss this situation yet, I was wondering if you had a chance to review the response?  Even if not the other document, but just to read the response we had discussed as of yet?  I got the email about closing the question so I just wanted to check in so I could consider that while I wait to connect with legal aid for ### again. Thanks43605.6166666667 Hi ###-so I got the response and it wasnâ€™t exactly what we had been expecting.  They had a much more limited scope than we had understood.  In some areas I feel like they ### the facts and ### the fact that we still currently arenâ€™t even doing anything effectively related to his sensory needs.  Like havenâ€™t even gotten a draft of a new IEP finished. So I will send you the response I received and the response I sent back trying to clarify. They met with me Thursday to discuss and asked me to write back more clearly.  Not sure if they will attach but I will try.  Thanks. 43596.6138888889 There is a very long and detailed timeline of issues we have been dealing with for our sons transition into Kindergarten this year.  It has been very hard and there are many issues and documents that are a bit overwhelming but I have been addressing this pretty closely with the director of student support services and principal for a while now.  We have finally begun to see progress to get him back to the skill level he was at in Pre school due to many many procedural safeguard issues, basic special ed laws and basic competency to be honest. Today before a team meeting I met briefly with them when they asked to give me an update on my official complaints I raised.  They are going to be giving me a response soon and they are at a point where they wanted to let me know they are going to be agreeing with some of the serious concerns I raised based on what they have been able to learn so far, including the fact that his entire IEP was not well done or implemented. They apologized and thanked me for being willing to work with them on this and I have a lot on my plate so they wanted me to know this so I could consider if I felt necessary to still compile all my supporting documentations more completely for consideration knowing they were going to agree and that if there was anything I needed to address when they respond by providing anything it would still be considered and addressed. They were also looking to have me start considering what a possible resolution would look like for me to feel ok with this being resolved.  Iâ€™ll be honest Iâ€™ve never had them be willing to agree, especially in writing with allegations like this about his case manager and the OT for the district specifically.  Their actions have seriously caused emotional and financial harm to my family, but especially my husband, son and I. Itâ€™s taken all year but he finally has a good case manager, and the right people at the table but it hasnâ€™t been easy and frankly he still has made little to no academic gains, heâ€™s very limited in accessing his environment throughout the day due to unmet and very significant and well documented sensory needs, and some big developmental ### in several domain that we started trying to address last spring.  My question is what does resolution mean in this type of situation?  I donâ€™t know that I am even sure what would be a reasonable idea to consider and I didnâ€™t know if there was anything I should know before I consider responding when I receive their decision in writing.43585.1152777778 Areyou familiar with the IEP process?  Different schools handle it differently and it is my impression that Vermont generally is less ### of the rules than other states (e.g., California with which I am more familiar)  This process is subject to Federal law so, if you have the stamina to have a lgal fight with the school district, you do have a number of alternatives available.  To begin with, you should read and familiarize yourself with the processes described here:  https://education.vermont.gov/student-support/special-education/laws-and-regulations/dispute-resolution.  For example, you could start by demanding mediation and then, if that is not satisfactory, moving on to one ofhe other alternatives such as a demand for a due process hearing.  At some point, you might need to engage counsel to help you.43895.7902777778 By the way, I am not an expert in this legal area.  I know a little bit about it only because m wife, who is retired, taught special education in California for many years.  If your daughter is being seen by a mental health professional in whom you have confidence, that person might have a remmendation of a Vermont attorney who knows the area well.  Alternatively, if you wish, I could reach out to my network and see if I can find someone with whom you might consult.43895.8305555556 I am prepared for a full litigation including but not limited to undue emotional distress, defamation of character, refusing access to free and public education, as well as exclusion of social extra curricular activities (namely basketball) the list goes on and grows. I have begun the mediation process because that seems to be the â€œchain of commandâ€ and we are eyeballs deep in the middle of an iep/###. I really feel as though I am at the point where I need legal counsel. I do have stamina for this. I have a huge file of documentation of the things they have done and everything my daughter and myself have done and I have also begun to audio record every meeting, with their consent. So they are aware that theyâ€™re being taped. I wish I had known in the beginning that I could do this. I had one principal tell me they were grasping at ### as to how to deal with her behavior, they didnâ€™t know how to handle her behavior despite me verbally telling them to let her have a minute to process the direction given (more than ###) etc.  I was told she needed to be in an alternative work space so they placed her in the kindergarten classroom. She is in third grade. She was denied going to the nurse after a boy who was in the 5th grade pulled her down from behind and she smacked her head on the concrete floor and then they sent her home on the bus and never even filled out an incident report. Bear in mind that this was on a Friday afternoon and she had a 15-###. I immediately gave her an ice pack called the principal to report the incident who told me she was in the room when that happened and nobody saw who did it so all of the kids were made to sit down as it was the end of the school day and they were waiting for dismissal. I then driver her ###. The following day (a Saturday) I happened to run into a classmate of my daughter who told me exactly who had pulled my child down. Monday morning I went to the principal with the information and nothing was done. The sad thing is, is this is the same child who had been picking on my daughter previously and I had reported him that time as well. I guess my next question is should I hire I private personal injury lawyer, an educational lawyer or should I just go to legal aid?thank you. 43895.8208333333 I have an update for you.  The Vermont Bar Association runs a referral service.  I just called them and, for issues in the area of concern, they suggested consulting with ### ###.  More information about Mr. ### (whom I do not know at all) is here:  http://www.msdvt.com/ed-###.html.  His phone number is ###-###.43896.6138888889 I might get ba response from one of the other folks I tried to conbtact and, if so, will lt you know.  Other than that, I think I've done all I can.Good luck.43896.8229166667 I think you are best off starting with an education lawyer.  You could call legal aid but I am doubtful you would get someone with the right expertise.  Although here might be aspects more within the expertise of a personal inury lawyer, it sounds like the majority of issues are in the education space so I would start there.  (By the way, my expertise is intellectual property and computer law so, although I am happy to try to help you find someone suitable, I personally would not be qualified to help.) I did a little searching and did not find anyone in ### County.  I have reached out to a firm in urlington and will let you know if they respond.  I am trying one other source for an additional recommendatio too.43895.8569444444 I was thinking that also. Every step of this process has been a battle. Thank you for your help43896.60625 I would appreciate it very much if you could point me in the right direction. We are nearing the end of the iep evaluation process and now the district is pushing for me to enroll her into an alternative school specifically designed for troubled ###. The problems I have with this are: I once worked at this school and left because I did not agree with their philosophy or policies. I also know the nature of the â€œtroubledâ€ kids who go there and my daughter really is not a victim of domestic or any other type of abuse, does not have an addiction or any other extreme issues that if she were to be exposed to in this school, would steal her innocence. I also had concerns surrounding transportation to and from this school, that is a ###. A ###. Who is very naiive and innocent on a ###. Ummmm no. 43895.8361111111 My apologies. I gave you the incorrect email address. It is beautybyquinn1002 @ Gmail dot com sorry for the confusion. 43896.5847222222 My daughter, beginning in February of ###, that had escalated to the point of her being physically restrained and placed in a safe space, separate for all of the children (this is truly a long story, but I am trying to make it brief). The issues with the school escalated to the point, where at the end of the school year, I ended up keeping her home for the last ###, that she said was a result of the behaviorist using a Handle With Care technique. Over the summer the school principal and I, along with another agency set into motion a ### in an effort for my daughter to have a positive, successful school year and for her to feel safe going back. However, the emotional anxiety returned three days into the school year and have now escalated to a point where she is being evaluated for an IEP/504 (academically, she is right on target with the other students) and has been suspended. I have done a lot of research and taken a lot of steps on my own, but the deeper I get into this, the more I feel like there is more to all of this than what has been presented to me. She is not attending school right now, pending the results of the evaluation. We haven't seen these issues to the degree at home that they're seeing them at school. She is receiving ###, ###. Now, they're not even offering her any alternative than going to a different school, or being homeschooled. They are completely leaving return to her school of origin. I would like to seek legal counsel and start a law suit against the school because of the emotional turmoil that's been inflicted on my daughter. She is afraid to even return to this school at this point. Am I within my rights to do this? I have sought out mediation for some of these issues, but not all and that is still pending also.I have found that the district and administration are lying to me about several things, or maybe they really just don't know the laws. But one of the schools that they are offering is Project ###, which, I don't feel is an appropriate environment for my child. Not to mention the fact that they want to send a ### (a ###) in a cab! My child gets medicaid, so I did offer the alternative of a GMTA driver, which is medicaid based and would even save the both schools money with transportation costs.I was told that transportation is a privilege, not a right.Thank you.### M JewettPS: The documentation I would like to share is too large to share in this forum.43886.6222222222 Ok  I take it you'd like me to give this contact info to whatever lawyers I find that seem worth your while to at least have an initial chat with.  Unl;ess you tell me otherwise, I will otherwise treat all of what ou have said in our exchange as confidential and leave it to you to relay it to the attorneys with whom you chat.So far, I have only identified a single firm that might be suitable in the Burlington area.

I tried to send my contact info. ### Jewett ### ###43895.8791666667 Thank you so much for all of your help. I appreciate it so much because I didnâ€™t even know where to start with anything legal. I did begin the mediation process and I began researching and fact checking the information and learned that they were either out right lying to me, or had a ton of misinformation so I am pretty sure that they were not misinformed. I have been fighting for my daughter for a year and when they pulled her out of school in January and refused to let her play basketball or even hand out valentines cards to her friends I had fi all had enough. So from the bottom of my heart thank you. I am very grateful. 43896.9013888889 Very goog--thanks for the correction.  Thus far, I have had no response from either of the education law firms with which I left messages yesterday.  It occurs to me that perhaps you ought to call Legal Aid after all.  Even if hey don't have the right specialist available, they might have recommendations for one or more people you can try.43896.6027777778 Yes please pass along my information if you feel that you think could help me. Also, if they ask for details, please share what I have. But I do have all of this documentation to back up everything I have told you. This is in the form of email, written communication and her student record from the superintendent as well as all of the services and resources I have tapped into to help me along the way. It dates back to the end of the school year last year. 43895.8958333333 You are amazing! Thank you so much! I will look into this today!43896.6791666667 Good morning ###,Here are a number of ideas and options:###. Send a written complaint regarding bullying to the school and keep a copy.  Include a chronological summary of the bullying your daughter has experienced over the years and your attempts to address this starting with what has happened this week and going back in time. Here is a link to the current Parent-Student Handbook for the Williamstown Middle/High school including the requirement for the District to investigate complaints of bullying and harassment.  See page ###       https://docs.google.com/document/d/###IIm7r_zlEIDKyrZ88iI_Cqb###iozm0aYuS-j-CiTlNJo/edit ###.  If the investigation does not result in helping your daughter you have a right to request an Independent Review of the investigation and could file a complaint with the Agency of Education    ###      ######.  Contact Vermont Legal Aid Disability Project for assistance.  They specialize in cases such as yours.  https://www.vtlegalaid.org/disability-law-project     I am not sure if your daughter qualifies for their help if she does not have a disability diagnosis but they can help you find help if they cannot assist.###.  Another helpful organization is Vermont Family Network  https://www.vermontfamilynetwork.org/what-we-do/family-support/    Best,### ###, Esq.44089.4493055556 my daughter has been bullied, mentally, verbally, physically, and emotionally for the last ###. We have contacted the principal, teachers and other peers about this over the remaining ###. My daughter has been in school physically for the last ###, today making ###. She recieved threats she was going to get her ### beat, and her throat slit. These bullies have yet to be stopped. We've been told numerous of times and investsgation would take place and nothing ever happens. ###. His response was go ahead nothing will ever be done." ###. 8!! I will not tolerate her being treated this way. The precious principal and guidance counselor brushed it under the rug and left it. My child enjoys going to school. But last night she was to the point where she broke down kicking screaming crying and locking herself in her rokm stating she was not going to school. She did not feel safe and she was scared for her life. As yet another student whom she was extremely close with took his own life ###. I as a parent need to be the voice for my child and I for one will not watch my child suffer any longer. It has already been long enough. One year and investagation did take place and the other child recieved in school suspension. Whenever my child is bullies and she goes to a peer they always tell her its her fault shes too nice or to grow up she'll be fine. NO NO she won't be fine. This has effected her in so many ways shes very insecure of herself she talks down about herself and says she doesn't want to be around because she has no friends everyone at school is mean to her and they don't want her here. I will not lose my child over some petty bullying. This has been going on since she was in first grade she to this day is in 8th grade. No child no adult should ever be bullied. I have gone to the school board and they said there's nothing that can be done. I have gone to the principal and guidance counselor and yet nothing was done when they said there would be an investagation with nothing happening.  So after ### threats and my child refusing to go to school. I am taking my next step. Talking to a lawyer. Im in need of some help and security for my child. Thank you### Amell-Johnson "44088.6430555556 I live in St. Johnsbury Vermont and I have a ### 2nd grade at the St. Johnsbury School. My son is Autistic, has tourettes syndrome and is legally blind. This school year has been increasingly more difficult for him, for what I believe, to be negligence and abuse from some of the staff.  His special education coordinator neglected to have my sons therapy services intact when school started and it took repeated questioning from me to get that meeting into place. My son is known to be a runner when he gets scared or frustrated and on one occasion this happened under her supervision. She called me and literally said I was not going to chase him". He ran out of the building and was heading towards a very busy street. She clearly had no respect for his personal safety because she didnt care to do her job. While still waiting for her to schedule his initial IEP meeting and well into October I tried to reiterate how important consistency is for him as there was absolutely no routine or consistency of any kind. She said "well I am not a very consistent person" At this time the school has arranged for her to have a mentor to teach her how to do her job. More upsetting is a recent incident with the technology teacher. My son was upset over an incident and began crying in class. He has difficulties regulating himself so the para stepped out with him. Once calm he was brought back to class and the teacher demanded he apologize to his peers. My son (who was previously nonverbal) tried to explain that he was sad and why. The teacher interrupted him and told him to apologize. Now my son was confused as to why he needed to apologize when he hadnt done anything wrong. Weve worked for years to give him the coping skills he used this day and the teacher completely dismissed his efforts. My son also tends to hit himself in the head and claim he is "such a stupid child" and he did during this incident. The teacher then replied with "well youre acting like one". At this point my son was removed from the class and no longer allowed to participate with his peers. All was witnessed by several people including the paraeducator. The schools response was to give them one on one time to rebuild their relationship. This is not acceptable for what happened. What can I do? What are my legal rights and where do I go for help?

Application for change of name.(B) A parent who desires to change the name of his minor child may petition, in writing, a family court judge in the appropriate circuit. The other parent, if there is not one then the child, must be named as a party in the action unless waived by the court. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the child. The court shall grant the petition if it finds that it is in the best interest of the child.SECTION 15-49-20. Petition requirements for name change; notification; costs.(B) Prior to issuing an order for a name change, the court may conduct a hearing on the petition and may order the petitioner to be present.(C) Following the hearing and upon consideration of the petition, the reason contained in the petition, and other documentation before the court, the judge must determine and grant or refuse the name change as the judge considers proper, having a due regard to the true interest of the petitioner and protection of the public.So, you can do this in family court in the county where the child lives.  The court will appoint a GAL for the child and may conduct a hearing to make sure the name change is in the best interest of the child.  There is some legal type drafting required for the petition, which is why a lawyer may be helpful.  There may also be some associated fees.

If you do that a judgment is going to be entered against you and your grandmother, that the judgment creditor/student loan company will attempt to collect. Once entered, a judgment is good for ###. A judgment is also going to damage your credit and your grandmothers credit. That being said, if both of you donâ€™t have any assets, they canâ€™t get from you what you donâ€™t have, and the judgment will just sit out there for ###. The second option you have is to respond to the complaint. You do that just by sending a letter and that says you either admit or deny each number paragraph of the complaint. Both you and your grandmother have to respond to the complaint. Once you do that the court will schedule a hearing and youâ€™ll go to the hearing and each party will present their side. I understand that you thought that you had consolidated all of your student loans, an while this is not a defense to not paying, it could explain why you havenâ€™t been making payments. after the hearing, the judge will issue a ruling, that will likely result in a judgment being entered against you and your grandmother. Again, a judgment is just a piece of paper that says that you owe money to the creditor, but if you donâ€™t have the money to pay it or you donâ€™t have any assets that they can ask the court to seize and sell in order to pay it, then the creditor is just left holding a piece of paperA ###  option is for you to contact the attorney for the student loan company and explain to him that you thought that all the student loans had been consolidated, but apparently this one wasnâ€™t, and to see if you can work out A way  to settle it either through a payment plan or a lump sum payment. 44104.5534722222 Alright thatâ€™s not a court order that is a complaint suing you and your grandmother for the debt. When did you receive this document? And how did you get it? Did it come in the mail or did someone show up and serve you ? 44104.5277777778 I am uploading the entire case document here (###).Thanks44104.5222222222 My grandmother and I recently received court order dated for an outstanding private student loan from ###10.

She said it was a name change but his name is staying the same and that it was required to send it to me for a chance to contest. I'm not contesting it at all. Why would I? It's staying the same. Something seems off about her request and I feel like she is misleading me. When we last checked, she didn't even need me to get his birth certificate and that if I wanted to be added THEN we would need all the extra paperwork. My question is; Is that a thing needed to get his birth certificate even without me on it?44152.3479166667 Without seeing the paperwork, it is hard to tell for sure, but it sounds like she may be trying to change your child's name which may require your approval.

If you have a follow up question post-hearing, please send us another message. I'll close this one out since it has passed.44195.8465277778 These kids are a year old than him. My son just came out of a major surgery last Sept, and went back to school Oct. 26, He has been telling me that he does not want to go to school.44169.6895833333 We are from ### and moved to Graniteville, ### County, the school my Sophomore son attended is ### Valley - High School. We just moved here last TERM000###88. My son is a new student and has no friends in school, he dress up well and takes care of himself. Last November, he punched a kid in school because it was bullying him, calling him with female name. After ###, the fight occurred inside the cl###room. Kid -###, when someone from behind called my son names while in cl###, he looked back on his chair saw kid-###, and my son told kid-###, kid-###, so my son got up and beat kid-###. Kid-###, then kid-###-###. Now, my son said he punched the wrong kid.These are the statements of the ###:kid ###: we were sitting in the cl### & called ###'s name and he said he was gonna beat my ### & he got up and ran at me grabbed me & swing that's when I ### myself & swing back not repeatedly. Just twice to get him back then I walked outside." (also in the attached)kid ###: "I had just turned my test in and I hear kid-###'s name and ### said something along the lines of "I'm going to beat your ###." I turned and looked at Kid-### "I'm right here". ### got up and ran at kid-### & started hitting him before he got out the desk. I ran over to them to help get ### off of kid-###-###. I hit ### a couple times before he let go and teacher got between us."mySon: "I mistakenly heard kid-### "###ice" and I got mad and said "I gonna beat his ###" Then kid-### "Then do it" so I ran at him and punch him. He got up and started hitting me back and then kid-###.The result: My son had a swollen head but I was not able to bring him to the doctor for check up bec he did not told me and I notice it after ###. My son told me that they have been calling him names for ###. He did not fight back to those kids the first time because he does not want to screw up his driving license application. The day after he got his drivers license this fighting happened.My questions:What are the options  I can do to those kids if they also bring a lawyer and also say to the appeal hearing on Monday not to expelled my son from school but just let him be transferred to a different school or go virtual?"44169.68125 Based on the information you provided, so long as you did not know if their actions or provide them with the drugs, I am not aware of a cause of action that she could bring against you. If you find that additional legal assistance is necessary, please contact the South Carolina Bar Lawyer Referral Service at 800-### or call the Legal Aid Telephone Intake Service (###) at ###-###.

Can she have a case against me since I did not have knowledge of it happening? The situation happened a couple months ago. 44185.0993055556 ### County School district resumed classes on ###. 11, 2021. On Tuesday, ###. 12  i received a call from the school nurse stating my son and another of his classmates had been exposed to Covid. (###!). She said he had to quarantine for ###. She could give no specific info on how, when or where this exposure occurred. My son's class has ### ###. I feel the school is doing this because I did not sign their Covid waiver releasing them from any liability due to Covid infections. My son has shown no symptoms of Covid.44210.5840277778 Thank you for your message. Schools are not required to disclose who had Covid if a classroom or a different group of people have been exposed. In addition, since so many infections are occurring every day now, it is very likely that your son actually has been exposed and the DHEC recommendations are that someone who has been exposed should quarantine, even if asymptomatic.  I hope that you and your family stay safe during this time.44214.7791666667 In November my childâ€™s teacher did a survey will all virtual learning parents. I do not recall her mentioning that kids would be able to attend school ### ###. On ###st the school board announced that they would allow student to attend school four days a week and would take extra precautions to keep all students and staff safe. I was told that my child cannot attend ###. Had I known it would be ###, I would have agreed to send my child to school face to face. As a tax payer, does the school district have the right to deny my child to attend face to face learning. I was told there is a waiting list. And will I and my other family member be compensated for the fact that they are denying my child the public school education that he so desperately needs. Virtual learning is a joke and also limits parents income that is already taxed to provide funds to schools.44236.0708333333 Thank you for your question. The schools have the authority to manage their schedules and balance the needs of virtual and in-person students. The fact that you filled out the survey indicating that you wanted virtual learning is enough for the school to require that you go on the waiting list if you want to change your mind and send your child to school in-person. I hope this answers your questions.44236.5805555556 Our son, who is a senior in high school, fell into a deep depression last semester after being confined to online learning and subsequently failed ### ###. He had previously been an honor roll student. After some professional medical intervention, he was encouraged to try out for the baseball team by some ### friends even though he has not played since he was five. He was told he made the team to only be told ###. The mental anguish of this has been detrimental to the progress he has made. I appealed to the governing SCHSL and was told that even though there is a â€œSpecial Conditions Eligibilityâ€ hardship section (5) specifically stating that medical conditions that cause academic failures could be considered with proper documentation for eligibility review, it would be illegal for the Commissioner to deem him eligible based on his medical reason for failing the classes. So, why is this in the bylaws if he canâ€™t do anything?   The athletic director has informed me that the Commissioner for the League is insisting that he will deny our appeal because â€œIt is illegal for him to rule in favor of an academic appeal regardless of the circumstances according to state law.â€ We have ample documentation of evidence supporting his mental breakdown which led to the academic failures. The evidence was reviewed  by Central Carolina at our request and was deemed significant enough to have the failing grades excused and converted to â€œWâ€™sâ€.Iâ€™m truly confused. Why would it be in the bylaws that he can rule on this type of hardship if itâ€™s illegal? I have read the ###â€™t figure out why he wonâ€™t even look at the documentation. Is there a state statute as he says that prohibits him from allowing eligibility based on academic ineligibility due to a medical condition? The bylaws can be found on their website if you are willing to explain this to me. Thank you so much!44283.2145833333 Have no cases.

My family have been migrant workers for ###. My homebase is Los Urbanos, San ### Potosi, ###. We traveled to ### for the holidays and to visit a family member that is on a respirator resulting from his exposure to covid about ###. We where in ### for ###. 3rd, school started today ###th. My son is not allowed to return to school for ###. BUT he isn't allowed to do remote learning. AND these ###, meaning he can't make up the work. He could possibly fail the school year. He isn't expelled. He isn't in ANY trouble. The principal says that it is the law. I just wanted to confirm if my child is being denied public schooling illegally. He is also threatening me with taking me to court for excessive absences. My son has only missed days for being exposed to covid and as a precautionary measure by the school. This principal has really used his power to overrun several families in the same way. I just wanted to know if the principal is in his right of way or if my sons rights as a migrant student are being denied?44201.6069444444 On ###, I enrolled my children at River City ### School.  Per the HeadMaster, Mr. ###, he and I agreed that the kids can attend for a tuition rate of $### 5/1-31/2021. A couple of days after the kids attended the school, Mr. ### had his assistant, ### ###, harrass me and call me daily until 5/###.  I e-mailed both stating my first available appointment is Tues, ###.  Ms. ### called me back and demanded I meet with Mr. ### no later than ###.  Due to work and life schedule, I am unable to meet face to face until ###, as stated in the e-mail.  I want to note the purpose of this face to face was to discuss future enrollment/tuition, which was NOT important for me to take time off of work IMMEDIATELY.  On 5/### 3:25p, I received an email with overdue ### for May balances from the bookkeeper, ### Buntyn, and a mention of me not responding to a meeting with Mr. ###.  I had responded back and said I do not owe anything AND address the meeting.  NOTE: I have in writing Mr. ###'s agreement of $###, receipt I had paid and e-mail of my availability to meet in person.On 5/### 5:53p, I pickup my kids from after school care to find all of my son's belongings with him, as if it was his departure date.On ###, 7:25a... ###, I received Mr. ###'s e-mail stating the kids are NOT allowed to attend school until I have a face to face meeting with him.In short, I would like to either have the kids continue at the school WITHOUT any unfair treatments OR receive a refund for a prorated amount that my kids will NOT be continuing at this school, since I'm paid up for the month.  To be honest though, I am afraid to send my kids back to this school, with this man.  He has already shown his true colors and I don't trust my kids will be treated fairly.  This man is VERY greedy, egocentric and NOT a servant of GOD as the school represented to be faith based. I will end with a little background of my personal situation that will add to the reasoning of why I required tuition assistance and the timing of the meeting.  Summarizing April-May:I am a single mom with ###. I put my house on sale and was in closing.I was in transition of moving mine and my kids' belongings by myself to an apt. I had just completed my peak work schedule on ###. I had to pickup a side gig, so I can continue to pay the ###s. I was still trying to finalize my divorce.Please call or e-mail me, so I can put this incident behind me.######-######44328.8833333333 I attend a medical school in ###, the ### School of Medicine at Tel Aviv University, that is registered and accredited as a New York State medical school (see JPEG attached).I began seeing a therapist in my first year of studies, and at the recommendation of a student advisor (a psychiatrist to whom I was NOT a patient) I was prescribed medication for my depression and anxiety on ### (medication takes ###-###), during my second year, after a long time of struggling emotionally and in school. I was required to pass the CBSE (an exam our school has us take before we can take the ### Step ###) in May of 20###7, but unfortunately I failed both the inital exam and ### (which I asked not to take because I was not prepared, and I wanted to have a ### the following year).I was given the year off on extended study" (letter attached) until this year when I was required to pass the CBSE and had only one chance to do so. My year off to study instead was filled with many visits to doctors and therapists changing my medications and dosages up until very recently the end of ###TERM000###95 when I finally felt improvement in my ability to concentrate learn and even just stay awake/function. Although because this did not happen until almost May I failed my exam in May again and the school did not allow a ### (although it did to students in years past.)Now the school has terminated my studies (letter attached). This is unjust as I was not able to study during my year off because of my mental issues I was working on resolving. I also was not given any support during this time off from the school although I had asked many times for a mentor to check in with me throughout my year off. I'm collecting letters from my therapists doctors and tutors from the last year as documentation to assist in an appeal. I'm hoping to ask for a personal leave of absence this year to return to pass the CBSE and continue on with school next year. Does my inability to study to pass this exam fall under the Americans Disability Act? Can I ask for an accomodation (to ### the exam) because of these medical issues? If I can't follow that route what can I do to stay in school? Is there any reason for them to grant me a personal year leave of absence for medical reasons because my last year off was for extended study? I want to be tested for learning problems but won't have time before the deadline.Attached is the school's policy of which the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (###) Pre-Clerkship Curriculum (###6-20) Leave of Absence Extended Study and Appeals of Committee Decisions sections will be of most interest."43256.2881944444 Hello Ms. ###,From going on ### Colleges website, if you withdrew within the 100% refund time period, there will be a $###.  Here is the webpage: http://www.###c.edu/money-matters/business-office/withdrawal.  I would contact the Bursar Office to set up a meeting to straighten out the fees and have them removed from your record.  You do not want unpaid fees on your record.  These can prevent you from ### later if you decide to return and sometimes can prevent you from enrolling in another college due to an outstanding debt.It sounds like something is showing you have not fully withdrew, so I would make sure that all the paperwork was completed and all offices are informed of this decision.  You may be stuck with a $###, but that is a lot better than all these other fees and late fees.  If they believe you are still enrolled and improperly moving forward with enrollment, they do have the right to charge you these fees, so I would clear it up quickly.  When you meet with the Bursar, I would also plan to meet with Admissions to make sure that they do not have you still enrolling.I hope this was helpful.All considerations taken.43399.1152777778 I was enrolled this summer for classes at a ### College for Fall of 2018. I have never attended college, and dropped all of my classes online before the first deposit was due. I've received multiple emails, and they're charging me a new student fee, an ID card fee (which I never had my photo taken or received an ID), a placement test fee, and a late fee. They've also been sending me reminder emails that the 2nd deposit is due. I am willing to pay the placement test fee, since I took those exams, but don't think that I should have to pay a student fee, ID card fee, or a late fee; or a second deposit for classes I never attended.Is this legal? Can they make me pay this money, and if not, how do I get rid of the charges? 43399.0472222222 Hello, My child was assaulted at school sexually by another student, bullied many times before this, treated like a dog by her teacher and I do not know what type of Lawyer to look for? Personal Injury? Title IX? I have recordings of the Principal denying my childâ€™s claims, refusing to help us and also threatening to retain her from kindergarten. Her teacher is also on these recordings yelling at my child, not allowing her to do school work that everyone else in class is doing, and then laughing about her bad scores with another teacher. My daughter cried every single day before school, her scores dropped dramatically from the beginning of the year until we pulled her out. She has been depressed, traumatized, punished, and we were never offered any support for her by the school but instead they took her out of her class to put her with this terrible teacher, let the boy who abused her continue his daily routines untouched, and told my husband and I directly that she was lying & she will not pass kindergarten because of her intelligence level based on scores that were forced on her. I learned about an IEP, knew she needed one, asked for it. Too long to keep explaining. I just need help taking action against the school district, the principal, the teacher, and whoever else for neglect, title IX deliberate ###, failure to follow child find procedures, failure to follow title IX procedures, failure to do literally anything. What specialty do I need to search for? 44326.8243055556 I'm so sorry your child is going through this. I would recommend looking for an education attorney.

Unfortunately, I cannot tell you any perfect way to fight your case other than to review your school's rules and explain yourself honestly to the academic review board. Second, law school places a strong emphasis on character and fitness. When you enter law school you are asked to explain any offenses, big or small. Unfortunately, two cheating offenses will likely be a serious consideration for any law school but this does not mean admittance is impossible.

We are high risk and with varying special needs a ### environment will not be the most successful environment for my children to learn. We requested this for the first semester which ends on ###.  During this time the only requirement was to fill out a form with our request.  We then were allowed access to an online program for the semester. As the pandemic continues to ### our community we are keeping our children home for the next semester. While our district has agreed to allow remote learning they are requiring a Doctors note about each high-risk resident of our home, including adults (who have never been seen by the pediatric Dr.) Therefore, in order to participate in online learning, we will be required to prove that we are high risk and we will have to provide personal medical records, including diagnosis information for every person in our home.  Is this a HIPPA violation?  If not do we have any legal recourse?  We have the right to keep our children safe and will not be bullied into giving up our personal information for the privilege to do so.  As an adult, parent, and logical personal I should not be asked to validate my choice to protect my children and my family.  Do you have any suggestions?44154.2236111111 It is important to figure out exactly what they require. I doubt they would require actual medical records. Form you question it sounds like they are requesting a doctor's note which would be a letter from a doctor stating that the patient is high-risk. I think there is a possibility that the doctor may not even be required to describe why or give a diagnosis because the school is trusting the doctor to make the call about who is high-risk because the school probably does not want to be making those decisions.It is not a HIPPA violation for them to ask. A HIPPA violation is when a medical provider shares your health information without your permission.44162.7090277778 Thank you so much for your reply. We have been struggling to understand this requirement too. I have attached a copy of the form requiring specific information about those who are high risk.  I know Renyolds passed a law in the summer of ###. Here is a link to that ### https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/###Book?ga=88&ba=SF2310&fbclid=IwAR2aLt0C_vQoWC9lSTkJ53ZbFGhSxUMyKvY8xmtOQH2LBXRAZzRm4wO-UL8.However, doesn't the ### or the privacy of the ###? Also as far as HIPPA, many medical professionals are reluctant to release information because they are aware that patients are not doing so of their own will. So it would be a violation of HIPPA on their end.### and her posse developed this law this summer making it an option for districts. It states that districts can require a medical waiver for all members of the household who are at high risk in order to justify online learning. College community is choosing to add this extra layer of bureaucracy to make things more difficult for parents and families. While ### has tried to make this legal in the state of Iowa and there are state laws on the books, federal law specifically the ### the privacy act of ###, and possibly HIPAA proceed any state law. Therefore the district or the state of Iowa ask for our medical information to justify online learning is against federal law. I have a letter that went to the school asking how they would like me to proceed. We are a high-risk family but we are not providing medical records. Quite frankly my children are staying home regardless of what the district provides. And in our case, if they choose not to provide a safe environment they are violating ###, other Special Ed laws, and other education laws that will eventually force the district to pay for private schooling for all of my children. This district has failed tvl families by ignoring and complicating the process when in reality the district is benefiting from the families who have made the ### to do TVl learning. They are benefiting financially as tvl learning costs far less than in school learning. The students and staff are benefiting by fewer students to potentially spread covid among the schools, the district is better able to social distance with fewer children per classroom, and teachers are benefiting because teachers are assigned to tvl services require a lot less Hands-On and investment than on-site ###.I personally have never been so ###, let down, and forgotten.

We decided to let him stay home as it was his first absence of the year and we try not to let him miss school unless itâ€™s necessary, but once in a great while we will let him play hooky. After we made the decision to keep him home, I went to go make him breakfast and I thought his dad was going to call him in absent and apparently he was under the impression that I was going to handle that myself. At about 11:###, we got a frantic knock on the door. Followed by the repeated pressing of the door###. This incessant knocking and ### went on for a good ###, but we did not answer. We did realize that neither one of us had placed a call to report his absence,We placed the call before noon to report his absence and went back to our ### movie marathon. At about 2:35, I looked at my phone and noticed that I had ###â€™t noticed before. I checked it and saw it was the attendance counselor from my sonâ€™s school that messaged me while she was ### my ### and banging on my door! She said she was outside my house because My son was a no call no show at school today and said she could give him a ride if that was the issue. I think I did have a flat tire at the moment, but it was still nice weather. He would of walked. I responded to the message that everything was ok and he would be back at school, honest misunderstanding. She then responded with a glad youâ€™re okay and a smiley face accompanied by a threat to return in that manner for every subsequent absence without a call. This is not even close to the school district policy for ### absences. So at ###:###. Sometime that day she notified my mother, who is listed as an emergency contact, but has no consent to be notified otherwise, that my son was not at school and then proceeded to grill her about me and my husbands social behavior and anything unusual going on to which my mother responded to with her concern that we may be using drugs and she was the one who bought my son new clothes for the fall. The counselor used this info as justification for placing the call to DHS. The laws in my state explicitly require the person who makes the report to be reasonably aware that abuse occurred, not to make a report based on the accusations of another person.

You may take a classes after waiting it out for one semester. Here is a portion of the policy:------------------Suspension. A student will be suspended from the University under either or both of the following conditions:At the end of a semester of probation the student has failed to regain good academic standing.At the end of any semester the student has a semester GPA of less than ###.00. (This regulation applies regardless of the ### resident GPA.)A student who has been suspended is ineligible to continue in the University for the period of one semester. Any ### student who wishes to return to the University after the expiration of the suspension must make formal application for ###tance through the Admissions Office. Special Students who wish to return to the University after the expiration of a suspension may register through ### Central. ###tance cannot be guaranteed. If the student is ###ted and fails to regain good academic standing by the end of the first semester after ###tance a second suspension of one semester will be incurred."-------------------Here are two options:###.) By simply waiting it out for a semester you may be able to continue by applying for readmission. It is probably worth a try if you have not explored this option.Additionally there is this provision:"Students on suspension may attend the ###-### ### ### and Summer Sessions (including the Three-Week Summer Session) for the purpose of improving their academic records. "This sounds like a great way to collect some credits improve your ### and prove to the University that you are capable of academic work. I would explore these two options first.With regard to federal law and students on military duty you can read more about federal law here:https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&SID=9b0be0###8###9ad###74bc######fe0###4604ea###de&rgn=div8&view=text&node=###4:###.###.###.###.###4.###.###9.8&idno=###4While it is true that there are many protections for members of the military who are also students the University does not have to take a student back under any circumstance. There are provisions that allow academic institutions to make "reasonable efforts" to allow a student back into a program. Here is part of the language:###"B) The institution is not required to ### the student on his or her return ifâ€”(###) After reasonable efforts by the institution the institution determines that the student is not prepared to resume the program at the point where he or she left off;(###) After reasonable efforts by the institution the institution determines that the student is unable to complete the program; or(###) The institution determines that there are no reasonable efforts the institution can take to prepare the student to resume the program at the point where he or she left off or to enable the student to complete the program."#########___The point here is that the University has some discretion in determining if there is a reasonable way that a student can be prepared to resume a program.Finally you mention medical absences in addition to military absences. You need to be honest with yourself in figuring out how all these absences affected your work. The medical absence issue is entirely separate from the military absence issue and so you should not confuse the two in thinking about this problem.I suggest you enlist the help of a counselor or sympathetic ### to help you put together a program to rehabilitate your academic career. I would suggest you approach the University with a cooperative and humble attitude and ask what steps you can take to be ###ted and ask about if you can attend Summer Session as mentioned in the University policy. Then try to get a written plan that can guide your actions.I hope this is helpful."43489.1583333333 I was denied my appeal on being suspended from ### Wisconsin ### ###. The reason being because of my unit's deployment this Fall, and their need to have rear det. members come in to help them ship out my role primarily teaching CLS along with other ###. This, along with some medical absences, lead to me missing some important class events, such as ###. I was working with the ### of Students office, and they had advised me to withdraw from classes, so that I would be able so save my GPA. I do not live in ### ###, and would have been kicked out of student housing had I gave up all of my credits, so they told me to keep a single credit that would have the lowest impact on my GPA. It should be noted that due to my absences, it was going to be a miracle to raise my grades to not get on ###. Despite following the ### of Students advice, I received a letter from the College of ### & Sciences informing me that I would be suspended for having a low semester GPA - it turns out that with having only one credit, it will significantly influence that type of GPA despite retaining a GPA of ### I wrote my appeal and it was unanimously denied, but no explanation was given, so I went to set up an appointment to talk to the ### of my degree in person. Beforehand I had notified my unit of my suspension and that I would be changing addresses, and it was from there that I was informed that Wisconsin Law on the military makes it a legal gray area when it comes from being dismissed due to the result of active orders. I had never thought about the option before, but I am willing to try any and all avenues. While discussing my suspension, the ### made it clear that with an appeal or not, I would have been suspended either way. This was despite having discussed with the ### of Students, my professors, and the services for students with disabilities about my options  and was recommended to leave one credit, which ultimately led to my suspension. After having brought up my active orders, he made it clear that, that did not warrant any consideration at the board. I like to be honest with people, so I informed him of my unit's suggestion of looking into if there were any options that I could take legally, and he got defensive and thought that I was threatening him. He stated that the schools legal team would just show that I had withdrawn, and was a failing student as evidence. I fear that, despite being honest with good intentions, I have ### the schools opinion on myself, and that there is nothing that I can do about this situation. I am looking into other schools, but if there is a legal option I would like look into it.43488.9152777778 In ###â€™t know the sign for shooting guns because my answer was going to be hunting.

His special ed case manager and other teachers report that he is respectful and a "pleasure to have in class" when he is there. The school still issues him truancy tickets unless I take him to the Dr. each time for a medical excuse. I can't afford to do this. I'm wondering what his legal rights and options are and what accommodations we can request - particularly for home bound education if possible.He is a senior at ### High school in ### and will graduate with his class in ###.  He will be ### ###. We plead not guilty to the most recent truancy ticket and have a pre-trial meeting with the city attorney ### (this will be after he is already graduated).  In the meantime we have an IEP meeting this Wed ###. I'm considering requesting his plan be changed to a ###.  This is probably irrelevant but I'm a single mother and all three of my children have special needs and have had ### or ###'s a real strain and I have a lot of expenses.  Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you### ###### WI"43542.83125 Hello Ms. Champion,Depending on the misconduct of the aide, the school does have a right to deny the aide to appear within the school.  The overall protection of the students will overrule the need of your child to have that aide present.  Depending on whether the aide is supplied by the school or by you would shift who is responsible for replacing the aide.Here are some resources that I would suggest that you contact:Community Justice Incorporated ### Represents low-income families and individuals in cases involving landlord/tenant, disability and mental health, employment, family, child welfare, education, discrimination, ###, land use, environmental issues.

The most recent problem came Friday when the principal called to inform me that there is an investigation going on because of several complaints from staff about his aid regarding misconduct.

Thank you.### Champion43612.8430555556 Hello,From what I can research, ###. Stat. ###.###.  From the reading of the statute, the superintendent has influence on changing or eliminating bus routes.  But the power is with the school to ###. Stat. ###.56â€ƒ School bus routes. The school board of each district shall make and be responsible for all necessary provisions for the transportation of pupils, including establishment, administration and scheduling of school bus routes. Upon the request of any school board, the state superintendent shall provide advice and counsel on problems of school transportation. Any private school shall, upon the request of the public school officials, supply all necessary information and reports. The transportation of public and private school pupils shall be effectively coordinated to insure the safety and welfare of the pupils. Upon receipt of a signed order from the state superintendent, the school board shall discontinue any route specified by the state superintendent.Have you or the other parents contacted the superintendent regarding this issue?I did find some ### law firms that provide free consultations to further talk to them about this issue:###/###/###/These are probably your best option since ### law is a niche area of the law.All considerations taken.43683.5381944444 We went to our local School today ### school district in iron county wisconsin, we were told we live to far away for the school bus to pick up our kids, we have ###, with a ###.

Have you explained to your DVR counselor the challenge you are facing with this particular class? Ideally, you should do that in writing and emphasize how well you are doing in the other class. Here is what the DVR website says you should do in this kind of situation:What should I do if I think I have a special circumstance related to my disability that affects my training program?If you think that there is a disability-related circumstance that will affect your training program, including the number of credits in which you are registered, speak with your DVR counselor immediately.Point out what you are doing to succeed in this class. Are you going to the writing ###? If so, mention that. If your medication changes are affecting your ability to learn, mention that too. If you have already had that conversation, you should file what is called an exception request to ask that DVR pay for the spring semester and particularly Intro to College Writing to prepare you for English Comp. Here is a link to the exception request form. This exception will help you build a solid foundation for future educational and employment success. You would want to point out the same things I mentioned above about challenges you are having this semester and why this exception will help you. If they deny the exception, then you can appeal it. Don't give up. My son also has a disability and gets DVR services. Sometimes, what we think or hope will happen doesn't happen and we have to try something different. So, you just have to be persistent (but always respectful) with them. Best wishes.###43804.8736111111 I'm in the process right now of finishing my fall semester at Waukesha County Technical College. I'm ### taking ###. I'm taking English Comp and Record Keeping ###. Now I went into ### Comp way too fast, but I was told I was ready for that class, so I took it. Now since I was young I have had always problems in English due to me having a learning disability. Now I could have taken Intro to College Writing before my ### Comp, but like I said I was told I was ahead of that class so I was told to take the ### Comp so I did. Now I'm coming to realize at the end of my semester of ### Comp that I'm failing this class, because I didn't take Intro to College writing first. Now DVR is paying for my schooling, and since I'm failing in my ### Comp they are saying to me if I don't pass both classes, they won't pay for my spring classes. But I'm doing my best here to try and pass my ### Comp as well as my Record Keeping class. I'm doing well in my Record Keeping class right now, but not so well in my English Comp like I said. Now I do my homework everynight and I study hard, I feel I'm getting more help in my record keeping class than what I'm getting in my ### Comp, but nobody is listening to me. I'm also on thyroid medication, and my levels of medication have been up and down between ### to ### which can affect my memory levels which of course nobody at school understands when I try to tell them.

That's one reason why, I failed in that class and  the other reason why is,  because I just wasn't able for that class, like I told you earlier. I'm taking another class and in that class I'm getting all the accommodations, I should be getting even more and I'm doing well.

I am sure that you understand that this situation isn't something that either you or the university could have anticipated when you signed up.  They are simply trying to deal with this situation as best they can, like all universities across the country. I looked at the ### LaCrosse website and it appears that you can drop your class, but you CANNOT receive a refund at this point, unless the university grants you special permission.  I would attempt to work with them regarding this.  You are past the halfway point of the semester, and have therefore been receiving instruction up til this point.  When you sign up for school, this is a contract, and you are agreeing to pay for your tuition once you sign up and the relevant deadlines have passed. Most classes will be held online, where all you have to do is watch the instructor teach you.  If you are having difficulty accessing this, you should contact your professor and ask for help.  They should be able to put you in touch with someone who can assist you.

We are allowed to take specialized "ATI" tests at school and my accommodations are granted there but its still in the middle of a construction zone and hard to focus and concentrate.I've reached out and been proactive numerous times to my academic advisor who repeatedly does not respond to my emails.

Shortly after I received an e-mail from my Med-Surg II instructor ### ### stating the same thing.My complaint is that there is no one on campus to help those of us with accommodations in nursing classes. There seems to be plenty of help for those in general education subjects but the nursing students are just supposed to make it through or fail out. We have a learning center on campus that's supposed to be open and its not. Every time I go there looking for additional help/resources the door is locked and the lights are out. As is the library.

It stems from not being properly trained for the program and not knowing how to do very much in a clinical setting for the $9,###.I spoke out about our Med-Surg I lecture, clinical, and lab to the ###, and feel like I've had a target on my back ever since. I spoke out about how in Med-Surg I, we verbally checked off on skills that we didn't know how to do, the lab instructor never demonstrated how to do any of these skills, we were to teach the class on things we knew nothing about. Finally, that same lab instructor taught by youtube videos if we asked her how to do a skill. One person in another class even took a picture of her sleeping during a video in class!Our Med-Surg I instructor flat out taught us nothing and that is part of the problem that I have encountered this semester. ### in nursing was NEVER discussed.

We pay A LOT of money to go there to learn a very important career and we have every right to share our comments and concerns. The problem is is that the ### does not want to hear it.

You can find information here:https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/race394.html In fact, this site has a huge amount of related information.As an example, regarding harassment, the guidance states, The harassment must in most cases consist of more than casual or isolated racial incidents to establish a title VI violation."The idea here is that it must be repeated or pervasive. Another aspect of the philosophy behind this law is that there needs to be a significant negative outcome. For example a severe negative outcome would be denying a child an educational opportunity.You state that the counselor was not reprimanded. I am not sure how you know this. It is possible that this happened privately.As far as other people having a similar experience that best suggestion might be for them to complain as you did. If there is a series of similar complaints that might prompt a change.Unfortunately people say lots of dumb things and offensive things and there is no law against being offended. Stepping back from this for a moment I would suggest that this is a good opportunity to teach your child about how to think critically and remain in control of the situation. Just because someone says something offensive does not mean you need to give it any weight at all or let it invade your thoughts or let it ### an ounce of your own life energy.Best wishes."44071.1451388889 My question is regarding my ###. Back in Nov of ###â€™s school made an insensitive racist comment to my daughter. The comment that she made was,â€ black people culture are more louder than white people culture. After my daughter told her father and I, we went to the school to meet with the counselor. My daughter was also present in this meeting. I asked my daughter to say again what she had told her. Her response was yes I did say that. I asked her why would you make such a statement to my daughter, whom is ### American,? Her response was I didnâ€™t see anything wrong with what I said. So I proceeded to the principalâ€™s office to discuss with her about what her school counselor had just relayed to my husband and I. She proceeded to say she was in a meeting so she really didnâ€™t have time and that she was so sorry for what the counselor had said. No meeting had taken place at this time regarding what she had said. Fast forward to Feb. of ###. My neighborâ€™s child goes to the same school. She stated to my daughter the same counselor had said to her, there are only a few of you all in this school so ### should stick together. This child is also ### American. I decide to file a complaint with the Department of Education and they opened an initial investigation into the school. Then they wanted to do a mediation which I did not feel comfortable agreeing with. During our mediation I was told by the mediator that someone literally have to say the â€œNâ€ word before they can get terminated from their position. After I didnâ€™t agree to the mediation terms my complaint was returned their office for investigation. I received an email saying that there was insufficient evidence to establish violation of Title VI. I strongly disagree with this decision. Third counselor has on more than one occasion blatantly made the racist comment to children. She should not bring her biased beliefs into an educational institution where there are young children that are vulnerable especially at this age. She was not reprimanded at all, in fact the superintendent and the principle upheld her behavior. Saying sometimes we say things that can come across the wrong way. Also there is another parent whom has experienced the same racial discrimination against her child as well. This counselor is being allowed to continue this type of behavior. No child no matter what ethnicity should have to endure this unprofessional and unethical behavior.

We are only allowed a list of the concepts" we need to study. Even when we have specific questions about the integrity of the examination itself.The reasoning given is one of maintaining the integrity of the exam itself for fear of release of the exams to public as they are reusing them.However we were allowed review within a week of the exams just last semester and even within the first few weeks of this semester before this new policy took hold.I have found indications from California law that this could fall under Public Records and Education Code as a violation. I have also found indications that this goes against the Student Rights in Higher Education under Information Accessibility. Possibly specifically: "Right to receive a copy of their diploma thesis score and details about the score"I'm thinking I'll start at a simple Public Records Request?I'm striking out finding the legal information I need to go any further but this practice needs to be challenged as it is prohibiting the transparency of the educational process.I feel strongly about pursuing this and would very much like any advice you may have about a) public records requests and b) educational code or legal rights that I may have overlooked as they related to Wisconsin education.Thank you for your feedbackK. ### ###"44156.1326388889 If a college has taught me false theories or disproven teaching lessons that the univsrsity claimed as truth, is there a law that protects college students who graduated college finding out later many of the theories were biased partial observations misleading the whole fact of a study?44170.9673611111 No.  There is no law or recognized cause of action that would allow you to sue a school based on doctrinal issues with their curriculum.  There is no recognized claim for 'professor malpractice' of this sort.  You might be able to contact the organization that provides accreditation for the program (if there is one) and raise your issues with them.

I have to provide proof of this to be able to get financial aid for school and would like to know who to contact to get help with that.

Thank you in advance.44175.8152777778 Got it. Also, do you know by chance if the forcing of wearing ### in order to attend school is against the Constitution? I know it might sound odd, but I do believe this would be construed as child abuse.44241.8159722222 I have already advised an attorney, and as I understand it, the first step to suing a school district is filing the claim. I am having issues finding this form. I was then instructed that an attorney can represent us families during the court proceedings. Hence, I need help finding the forms to file on my own, and will find an attorney thereafter.FYI - if you need to know reasoning, my cause of action is: failure to protect a child from abuse, failure to meet the needs of special education students, failure to provide proper mental health resources for students, and failure to provide proper or sufficient educational resources and needs/requirements for children.44222.7381944444 One final in query - does this include the emotional or mental side effects?44242.7527777778 So, if I am hearing you right, doctors that attest that the following long ### side effects from wearing these are as follows: shortness of breath, weakened immune system, chronic ### conditions, and this is not abusing a child?44242.7430555556 You should consider filing the complaint with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instructions.

Best wishes.https://dpi.wi.gov/sped/dispute-resolution/complain44231.8472222222 a constitutional law question requires thorough analysis, which is impossible to do here.  but, i think, the state is likely to prevail in any challenge to a ### requirement.  the state would argue that requiring a ### is a reasonable, not overly restrictive condition given a pandemic.  there is no abuse in that and there is no apparent deprivation of a constitutional right.44242.7368055556 a court will need to examine these attestations and even if they are credible, i suspect the state will put forth many competing attestations.  with all of that, hard to see how a ### requirement qualifies as an abuse.44242.7513888889 my analysis would not change based on the type of injury/limitation asserted.44242.7541666667 Dear Mr. Paulson:This type of release is common and there is nothing wrong with it.Here is a nice piece that talks about the rights of minors and protected health information. It has cites to statutes, however, I do not recommend you go too deep as it will likely be more confusing if you are not an attorney. It also has alot of info. that is not pertinent to your problem.Also bear in mind that most law is not statutory it is judge-made meaning it is case law.https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/p01844.pdfThe key ### is that the counselor could not say anything to the school about your son's progress without a release. Likewise, the school would not disclose information. Let's hope this exchange combined with your son's humble and positive attitude will create a happy ending to the story and he can put it behind him.Here is what I would tell a friend or family member (and, as an aside, I have raised a large ### of children.):Sign the form and get on with it. I do not believe you are in a position to negotiate anything and you and your son should thank your lucky ### that there is a path forward to avoid expulsion.I wish you and your family peace. 44371.9520833333 My ###/o son is facing a potential expulsion for physical altercation with another male student. The district administrator has offered an abeyance agreement. One stipulation is my son successfully complete a approved counselling program by a certified/licensed counselor" While I have no problem with this stipulation the last line in the paragraph states "Parent/guardian will sign and execute a confidential release of information between the school and counseling agency"I question the legality of this request. Could you advise? Please include any relevant laws and/or information I can cite while trying to negotiate the terms of the abeyance agreement."44371.7520833333 sorry for mispelling your name, Mr. ###, - going too fast today.44371.9534722222 Hello ###,I am researching your question.All considerations taken.44415.6069444444 Hello ###,Thank you for submitting your question. Hopefully, the following information will provide some guidance about the laws related to your situation and your options moving forward.There are two laws that I was able to find that the University of ###consin may have violated. The first is a common law (non-statutory) doctrine known as negligent misrepresentation. The elements of negligent misrepresentation are: (###) the defendant made a representation of fact; (###) the representation was untrue; (###) the defendant was negligent in making the representation; and (###) the plaintiff believed that the representation was true and relied on it.As it applies to your case, it seems pretty clear that elements (###) and (###) were met; ###â€™s representation of fact was that they would secure a clinical placement in your state, and clearly you believed that this representation was true and, as such, you relied on it. Element (###) also seems like it would work in your favor. It seems as though ### should have taken greater care in evaluating your situation to determine whether clinical placements were available in your state instead of offering a blanket statement that they were available. Element (###) regarding the truthfulness of ###â€™s statement is questionable based on the language you and ### used in your conversations about local clinical placements. If ### made any guarantees about securing a local clinical placement in your state, then their representation was clearly untrue. However, if ### expressed doubt about securing a local placement or stated that they would give their best effort in securing a local placement in your state, then their representation may not have been untrue. Without more information about the specific language used in your conversation with ###, I cannot fully assess whether ###â€™s representations were untrue.The second law that ### may have violated is the common law doctrine of promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel has three elements: (###) the promise was one for which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee; (###) the promise did induce such action or forbearance; and (###) injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.As with negligent misrepresentation, the success of a promissory estoppel claim would depend substantially on the extent of the promise ### made when speaking with you about clinical placement programs. It seems as though you would have a strong case against ### if they stated with certainty that they would place you in a clinical program in your state. If they made such a promise, they should have reasonably expected that you would act on this promise, and you clearly did act on this promise. However, if ### promised something to the effect of â€œdoing their bestâ€ to secure a clinical placement in their state, then it would be far more challenging for you to show that ### did not do their best to secure a clinical placement in your state. One more thing to consider is that even if ### made a promise with certainty (i.e., â€œwe WILL secure placementâ€¦â€), there may exist an implicit condition that ### will secure placements if placements are available in the ### state/preferred location. Courts have held that the conditional nature of a promise can be a defense to promissory estoppel. See ### v. ###, ###.TERM00065### TERM00133### (###. Ct. App. ###0###7).If your claims of negligent misrepresentation and/or promissory estoppel are successful, you would most likely be entitled to compensatory damages. Compensatory damages are meant to restore a plaintiff to the position they were before the unlawful conduct took place. Compensatory damages account for any harm or loss suffered by the plaintiff. You may also sue for punitive damages, which are meant to punish the defendant for unlawful conduct, but punitive damages are usually not awarded in ### actions, so I would not rely on earning punitive damages. Finally, if your claims are successful, the court may award you with court and/or attorneyâ€™s fees.There are two types of actions you could bring against the ### system depending on the amount of damages you would like to pursue. If the amount of damages you are claiming is $###0,###, you could bring an action in small claims court. However, if the amount of damages is more than $###0,000, you would need to bring a large claims lawsuit. I will include information about both types of claims at the bottom of this document. You should note than any action against the ### system would almost certainly need to be brought in ### County, although a court may extend personal jurisdiction to another ###consin county if your ABSN program took place at another ###-system campus (not the ###-Madison campus).If you decide to sue the ### system, I highly recommend hiring an attorney that specializes in contract law and education law. If you do not already have an attorney, I recommend contacting the State Bar of ###consinâ€™s Lawyer Referral and Information Service for help finding an attorney in your area. I will include their contact information in a link at the bottom of this document. If you would like to speak about your issue in a bit more depth with an attorney, or if you need help filling out small claims forms, I recommend setting up an appointment with the ### Volunteer Legal Clinics (###). An ### consultation will be conducted by a lawyer who specializes in the area of law affecting your case, or an area of law closely related to the one affecting your case. However, ### attorneys will not represent you in court or in any other proceedings â€“ their services are limited to offering brief legal advice. I will include a link to the ###â€™s contact information below. However, you choose to move forward with your case, I ###h you the very best of luck.Lawyer Referral and Information Service â€“ State Bar of ###consinhttps://www.###bar.org/forpublic/ineedalawyer/pages/i-need-a-lawyer.aspx### Volunteer Legal Clinics (###)https://law.###.edu/###/services-hours-locationsSmall Claims Help###Large Claims Helphttps://wilawlibrary.gov/learn/large-claims-mcll.pdfAll considerations taken.44419.7638888889 Hi,Thank you!44415.6631944444 I applied to a Hybrid ABSN program. They said they secure local clinical placements for students. I called on several occasions asking if the clinicals could be completed locally in my state before applying and they said yes each time. After I enrolled and spent ### at the university, I had to step out due to medical reasons. I was promised a spot when I returned. During the process of ###, the clinical placement team contacts me telling me there are no local placements available within my state and that I will need to do clinical out-of-state. I was told this was not due to the pandemic, and that they just ###'t have agreements with the hospitals in my state. Even though I was told there would not be a problem with me doing local clinical by the admissions dept.I explained the situation to the clinical placement team and I was told there might be recourse for this inconvenience, but once I spoke to the ### they said no and had a letter written up stating the university is not responsible for any costs I incur for moving and that I will do all my clinical out-of-state, telling me I had to sign it to re-enter. I did not sign it because it did not seem right. Now I tried to assume the spot they promised and was told to reapply. I told the ### of nursing about the issue and they agree with the ### and told me to reapply. I did not get my money's worth and was lied to multiple times by this university. Is this legal? 44410.6194444444 Thank you so much for your in-depth research and all the information you have provided!! I will certainly look into these options.Thank you again!44420.7354166667 I am curious how the small city of ###, WI can mandate that ### be worn by everyone entering the school building.  There are no local health orders, nor state orders at this time.  They are using the big, scary falsified numbers from the ###.  There are currently ZERO children at ### hospital with covid.  We do not have a pending case.  44424.6993055556 The directive seems to be a result of the federal CDC's directive to wear ###s indoors, and most medical authorities agree.  Since there is no ### harm in wearing a ###, and no law forbidding a school district from instituting a requirement like this, they can do it. The politicization of what is an entirely medical matter is a difficult thing to parse out for most people.  Please let me know if you need additional clarification. 44425.74375 Although you can sue anybody for anything at any time, you have no tangible damages, so you are not going to recover anything tangible from such a lawsuit.  At best, you might convince the school that if something similar happens again they will contact you and allow you to come pick up your child and transport them from site A to site B instead of having the Sheriff do it.  If that is the outcome you are looking for, you can probably work that out with the school without litigation.### Harkess, Esq.44452.8659722222 I am just writting in, as i have a question about something that happened recently. I have a ### (A) and i have a ### ### and head start(B) So on the 2nd or 3rd day of school my ###-off. He gets on the bus with his brother at the stop by our house, then is supposed to ride that bus to site A, where he will get off the bus and switch to a shuttle to go to site B. When i picked him up from site B at the end of the school day his ### teach informed me that the teacher that ### the little kids from the buses to the shuttle had missed getting my ###. I am wondering if i am able to sue or what actions can be taken? I was not EVEN CALLED ON THE PHONE to be informed he had missed the shuttle and was being transported nor did i ever sign a permission slip. Had they called and asked me, OR EVEN TOLD ME, prior to transporting him i probably wouldnt be so furious.

Which is a private but US owned school that operates in the Dutch Caribbean and the US. Two years spent on the ### of Saba and the final two years in rotations within the US. I was last on the ### in the spring of ###. For this the Final exam known as the comprehensive is taken. Students were given ###. My first attempt was in spring and the second about a month ago in August. During the summer they changed the syllabus to remove a chance down to two. I fell just short on both attempts. I wasn't in classes during the summer, instead given leave to prepare for the august exam. Moreover the change to syllabus was made in early March during the summer semester. Now requiring me to return to ### to ### a class I completed in spring before I can sit for the third attempt. I reached out to the appropriate channels for concern (### / president / others) and received no word back after multiple emails expressing my concerns.Additionally there was a major change to the cost of this class changing from 500$ to ###$ and now forcing me to be labeled as enrolled which costs ###$ and the 500$ class. All a change from the 500$ (with other courses and ###) I paid in spring for the same course. When previous students paid only the 500$ semesters prior after their 3rd attempt. Which will sound odd I'm sure but I've received multiple invoices all dated due on ###st up until yesterday ###. So it is a bit of a mess.So I'm wondering if there is any legal action that could be takes from this situation as it is a major financial strain and as I see it a clear injustice. Thank you for your time,44455.3111111111 That's unfortunate to hear but I appreciate the work you put in. 44470.8784722222 HI, I appreciate the feed back....The school is telling us its illegal to ask if I'm vaccinated. Why would you say its legal to ask?  Looking for facts or how you came up with legal...44474.6027777778 I'm a bit confused - the school is asking if you are vaccinated but telling you it is illegal for them to ask you this?As to legality, there is no law prohibiting the school from asking if you are vaccinated.44474.6083333333 It is legal for the college to ask if you are vaccinated. It is legal for them to fine you for not wearing a ###, even for a short period of time, if they previously posted or sent a notice that this was their policy. If you need to sometimes remove your ### to help prevent migraines, you could try making a reasonable accommodation request. I took a look at Viterbo's website and found the information for doing so here: https://www.viterbo.edu/sites/default/files/2021-06/disabilities_document_rev_june_2021.pdf44474.5763888889 It may be against your ### policies/procedures for individual teachers to ask about your vaccination status, in which case you could complain to their dean/department chair; however it is not illegal for them to ask.HIPAA prohibits health insurance companies, certain health providers, and certain associated entities from sharing your information with third parties (except under certain circumstances). For example, your health insurance company is not allowed to tell your college about your health information without your consent. However, HIPAA does not prohibit your school from asking you about your vaccination status. This guide is specific to the workplace, but it is substantially similar to the guidance for a college and can provide additional information: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/hipaa-covid-19-vaccination-workplace/index.html44474.625 Viterbo college is fining 50.###.. it was only down for a brief period and its because i need air so slow down a migraine from happening... they also are asking me if I'm vaccinated.Is this legal? I need to stand up to them bullying me44468.1541666667 Yes...two teachers have asked me. The higher up  is telling them that's not allowed and illegal for them to ask me. Told the two teachers not to ask that.How can my choice to be vaccinated not be protected under ### or guidelines that protect my personal health issues.  44474.6152777778 ahhhh...that makes sense but doesn't seem fair when your being judged and treated differently for not being vaccinated.44474.6881944444 Happy New Year sir44561.85625 I was driven to suffer horribly by the sexual abuse of first DVR counselor ### ### then later MSTC student services psychologist with that abuse resulting in my developing temporary -###- of schizophrenia by blaming me for women coworkers horribly sexually harassing me then later by turning me into a violent man with sexual hypnosis that I never consented to and continued sexual harassment in public to this day.

I am much recovered from her ### now thank God44530.3236111111 you need to have a good faith basis in the allegations you make (or you can be sanctioned).  if you do, you can prepare a complaint and file in circuit court.  usually statute of limitations on tort claims is ###-###.   if you prove the torts committed against you and if your claim is not time barred, then yes, you would be entitled to compensation.  best wishes.44552.8520833333 Dear Mr. Wehrhahn,Unfortunately, you are probably responsible for paying the tuition despite any mistake made by your schoolâ€™s financial aid office. While the situation is unfortunate, and your school should not be incorrectly handling federal student financial aid (assuming you have accurately explained the story to me), you are obligated to pay back the tuition because you would have still been responsible for the tuition if the mistake hadnâ€™t been made. In other words, if your schoolâ€™s financial aid office hadnâ€™t made the mistake, then you would have had to pay the tuition when the ### was incurred. The school has since caught their mistake and reversed it, but you are still obligated to pay that tuition.You should start by submitting a FAFSA, at least to cover the Fall ###. You can get federal student aid via FAFSA for a past due tuition balance if you submit the application before the filing deadline. For the 2021-###, the filing deadline is in ###22. Unfortunately, the FAFSA application for the ###-### (would have counted towards tuition owed in Spring 2021).After you complete the FAFSA, contact your financial aid office again. If they truly made a mistake, then they should be willing to help you make up the difference of the tuition you owe. They might offer you a payment plan or even emergency financial aid. If they are not willing to help, then you may be able to get a private student loan to cover the balance. It may also be a good idea to inform the VA of your schoolâ€™s mistake â€“ you can submit a complaint here. The VA should follow up with the school and yourself, and they may be able to offer help.  Additionally, you may file a complaint at Federal Student Aid, I have included a link here.You would not be successful in bringing a lawsuit against the school.  If you would like a second opinion, I recommend contacting Buelow Vetter Buikema ### & ###, LLC, here is their contact.All considerations taken.44554.0777777778 Hello Mr. Wehrhahn,I am researching your question.All considerations taken.44548.5326388889 Hello,While you are waiting for one of our volunteers to respond, I wanted to point you to another resource that may also be able to help straighten out this problem. It's free service called Lawyers for ###. https://lawyersfor###.org/ Administrator44532.7791666667 My school veterans office knowingly input GI ### benefits in incorrectly to the VA thus my tuition was paid in full and I was unable to secure other aid aside from needed student loans as balance was paid in full. This was spring 2021, then in fall of ### $### for tuition even though I did not have any benefits. Again, I was unable to secure other aid because it looked as though the tuition was paid. Then in November the school finally repaid the VA because of their mistake and is sticking me with a $### ### for their mistakes. I want to know if there is anything legal that can be done in this situation. 44532.7298611111 Hello ###, I am sorry that this is happened to your son.  You have the right to appeal the suspension of your son.  At the suspension hearing, you can give reasons for disagreeing with the schoolâ€™s decision to suspend your child. You can also ask the school to remove the suspension from your childâ€™s school record. One reason to file an appeal to have the suspension removed is to prevent increases in punishment if your son reacts in the same way to getting teased and harassed.   It is a good idea to keep track of any further suspensions that your son receives and the amount of time that he is suspended.  If your child is suspended for more than ###.  The description of what happened to your son sounds like bullying.  Schools have a duty to prevent bullying.  The first step is to contact the school's principal about your concerns if the bullying has continued.  If you have contacted the school and feel that they have not done enough to protect your son, you can contact the school district.  DeKalb is District ###.  There is a Student Services Department in District ###, the Student Services Administrative Assistant, she is listed as the contact person for general information. I hope that this is helpful to you and your son's situation.  ###43811.7527777778 My son was hit in his genitals during school lunch. He has a ###. The school never called to tell us he was hurt he told us after school. He went to ###. He was never asked if he needed medical attention or spoken to about the physical altercation at all. We met with the school on Monday following the incident to find out what was being done and why we werenâ€™t called and told it involved minors and couldnâ€™t be told. The next day my child was taunted by another student at lunch about getting the offender detention. The offender kept finding my son sitting at a table with my son staring at him and telling him hi and laughing at him, and hen the school told him to stay away from him. This was all reported and the school did nothing. My son got tired and beat the offender up today and received a ###. We want to know why when the offender hit him he wasnâ€™t given a suspension but my son was. The offender prior to the original incident ### ### all over my son two days prior. He was questioned today without a parent when his father was at the school and kept asking to see our son and kept being told no. 43746.7055555556 Today when it happened again he told the teacher he didnâ€™t want to be singled out and while he was trying to stand up for himself he was told he has a detention.  We feel we canâ€™t fight this anymore on our own. From the beginning when they took his ### away in PE to now when heâ€™s being told he canâ€™t have recess.  Plus he can not according to some school rule even go in the grass when he isnâ€™t in PE. We canâ€™t afford help but desperately need help for our son.  43813.0895833333 We already tried contacting the principle and went nowhere.  My son who is in 8th grade at ### is currently in a wheel chair and is being told he can not go outside preschool rules. I donâ€™t think this is allowed. Not sure how to properly fight against it. He just wants to be able to go outside for recess.  Both days were nice no snow or ice.  12/### ###. And heâ€™s being told weather.  So weâ€™re we.  And we donâ€™t know what to do to help him not feel isolated.  ### for your time. 43813.0840277778 Would like to know what can be done about it43874.0395833333 Hi ###:I am sorry to hear about your son's experience on the school bus.  These actions were very inappropriate.  You did the right thing to make the school and transportation director aware of this situation.  I am not sure from your facts if the transportation supervisor is a school employee or employed through a third party bus company.It looks like the transportation director's response was to move your son to another bus, which was a positive move.  Based on your facts, we cannot conclude that the driver did not get reprimanded.  Her supervisor may or may not have given her a warning or other disciplinary action, but this would be confidential to her and not communicated to you.  However, if the transportation director is a school employee and he/she did not report this to the driver's third party employer, her supervisor may not be aware of the incident.If you would like to escalate this matter further, you may make a complaint with the Illinois State Board of Education You could also make a complaint to the School Bus Company itself if you haven't done that already.I hope the rest of the school year goes well for your son.Best,###43896.7756944444 Our son rides the bus and the other morning the bus driver stopped him sat him down and stood over him and proceeded to tell him she didnt like him he was a bad kid none of his teachers like him and everyone knows how bad he is. My son and her son got a detention the day before due to horseplay" at school. She blamed it all on my son and chose to talk to him like this on a bus full of children. My son cried himself to sleep is mentally defeated. We reported this to his school and the transportation director who both admit she did do what my son reported. She has shown no remorse and I feel she should be reprimanded. All they have done is move him off her bus. That doesnt feel like a win to me. This isnt the first incident with her acting hostile in front of a bus full of children. They told me it's a personnel issue and they cant tell me anymore."43882.8854166667 Ms. ###,I am so sorry to hear about this incident and your son's upsetting experience.  It sounds like you are taking the right steps by engaging with the school district to discuss what happened and what they plan to do to make it right and prevent it from happening again to your son or other students.  It also sounds like DCFS is investigating, which is very important.Other than those two processes, I am not sure what legal questions you have or advice you need.  If the situation does not get resolved by either talking with the district or action by DCFS, you could consider hiring and paying an attorney to look into whether you have any legal claims against the school district.  You can search for local attorneys using this tool: Illinois Lawyer Finder.Good luck with these next steps.Sincerely,###43906.7180555556 My ###. Pushed him out the classroom and across the hall.

During the ARD an IEP should have been developed.  Was a new IEP developed?  Did you disagree in writing and provide the district with your specific reasons for rejecting the IEP.  Did you make specific requests in writing?  Was your written rejection sent to the district's Director of Special of Education and Superintendent? If there was an IEP created that you rejected, you should have been sent Prior Written Notice by the IEP Team/school.Keep in mind that if you withdraw your child without an alternative placement for her, these will likely be ### absences.  Truancy will then become an issue.  44499.70625 My daughters school refused to go by doctors orders after she had a mental break down. She wrote she can not be around large amount of students in a class at one time due to social phobia and anxiety after a bullying accident due to my daughter being special needs and gay. The doctor recommended home bound or half a day resource only classes in the afternoon, with small amount of students. She was admitted to an outpatient program, but could not participate in group because there were more than five kids and she shut down and had a panic attach. The facility confirmed with a note that she can not be around a lot of kids at one time due to her social anxiety.  She already receives special education due to emotional disturbance, dyslexia, adhd, and anxiety. I have been to ###, because every time they won't offer what the doctor is requesting and my daughter can not return to school. She has been out for over a month due to this issue. I believe she needs private specialized school or I want them to send tutors, dyslexia intervention, speech, and her counselor to my house-the same services plus tutoring that she gets at school. They denied my request and said they only offer speech services sent to my house.

Is it worth it to pursue??44510.3180555556 I went to the school board meeting and started to voice my concerns when they shut me down. I really need help. Come on. Someone, answer me. I am attaching a picture of the speech I had prepared. They shut me down at the word perpetrator. They claimed I brought up a child. I never said the word child. 44517.7395833333 My children came to me and told me that there was a boy in the 6th grade that was caught ### in the bathroom. He also exposed himself in the 6th grade science class. The children told the teacher and the teacher told them donâ€™t be tattletales. The director/principal of the school said it was just a marker to the child. This boy was also caught exposing himself on a hike. Again, nothing was done. He rubbed himself on a girl in line, the teacher and principal/director said it was just a wedgie. There is an unofficial parent FB group for the school. I posted my question about this and my post was removed. I was muzzled. I am deaf. That FB group is my only form of communication with other parents. It is not like I can walk around on campus with an interpreter trying to find parents to ask them if they knew anything? I also emailed the principal/director to ask her. She said there was no reports. When I confronted her in person, we wrote back and forth, she said the boy just got his penis caught in a zipper. Why is she telling me different stories? I feel like the school is gaslighting me, other parents, and children to protect themselves. I also feel discriminated because I was ### on the FB group when it was my only way to communicate. Other parents have told me they have complained about this boy bullying their children, nothing is being done. I emailed the school board my concerns, I have yet to hear from them. It is like a wall of silence. I am attaching some evidence. I have a lot more from many, many parents. Too many to attach here. What I am showing you is just the tip of the iceberg. Please help us.

It is very generous of you to give a home to a foster child who has had a tough time. I am not certain why the school district will not agree to allow the girl to repeat a grade.  In order to be promoted she would have had to receive passing grades in the relevant subject areas.  You have not mentioned whether or not she has an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) which would be very helpful for a child with learning disabilities or behavior or emotional needs.  If she doesn't have an IEP, I suggest you ask the school district to evaluate her for an IEP.  In order to request an evaluation, do the following:Write a letter to the principal. Ask that your child be tested for special education services. Your letter should include:Problems that your child has hadSteps you or the school have taken to help your childThat you agree the school can conduct the evaluationTests you want doneTests you do not want doneThat you want a copy of the schoolâ€™s evaluation proceduresThat you need a response within ###You should also keep a written log of phone calls to the school that youâ€™ve made and I urge you put all requests in writing and send certified mail, return receipt requested, if possible so you have a record that the school received your letters.  Please keep copies of all correspondence for your files. If you need legal representation or to learn more about the girlâ€™s rights to an IEP, you should contact ### for Equality.

As a student you do have rights and should follow up with the administration. There are administrative procedures that you can follow up with.

Be well PB44131.9 Hi ###,I am sorry to hear you are having problems with your school transcripts. Illinois requires that a school board award high school course credit to a student transferring to its school district for any course that the student successfully completed, unless evidence about the course's ### and content shows that it does not address the relevant Illinois Learning Standard at the level appropriate for the high school grade during which the course is usually taken, and that credit shall satisfy the requirements for that course.

In order to confirm that your Ecuadorian high school courses before you came to Illinois meet the Illinois Learning Standard, you may need to use a Credential Evaluation Service.  Many school districts will accept an expert comparability recommendation from one of these services.  The service will look at whether the Ecuadorian qualification compares to similar qualifications in the U.S. education system. Your translated and ### transcripts will be required.Either way, ### CUSD ###, at section 6:300, the manual provides that â€œno student shall receive a certificate of graduation without completing all courses as provided in the School Code.â€ ### 5/27-22.

If you have a qualified credential evaluation service conclude that your prior Ecuadorian courses are ### and the District still refuses to count them, you can politely explain this to the District, and if they still refuse to change the transcript, file a complaint with the Schoolâ€™s Complaint Manager by using the Uniform Grievance Procedure.

The school told me they wouldn't graduate a foreign exchange student and they won't accept my international credits even when they were translated and with apostilles.

The professor deliberately failed me on a mock scenario exam where the grade was entirely up to the professor's discretion.

I have a severe and diagnosed anxiety disorder which has had a negative impact on my schooling. I am also a ###. I believe my professor ### the type of person I was and did not want me representing the program. He went to great lengths to have me removed. I am also not sure why I was removed. After failing the exam, I thought I had complied with everything he asked. He kept making me jump through hoops that other students that had to do ###s did not have to do. I thought I was entitled to a ### and I sent an email addressing my ### and the next email I got said I was removed the whole program. I think he prevented me to do a ### because I could prove I didn't earn a 47%There is more to this story, but I will run out of room, I do want to note that I was in his office and saw alcohol. I did notify the school and I am not sure where they are at with that. I want to note that I am a very honest person. I'm not vengeful, I just feel like I did not get what I signed up for. The program went through constant changes due to Covid and the semester in question was expedited. I was also supposed to have a round of on the job clinical training before my final practical exam  My college also experienced a cyber attack which made online portions impossible for weeks and there are still issues.

At our clinic, we provide answers to legal questions, and we assist our clients in representing themselves in lawsuits. Unfortunately, we do not file cases on behalf of our clients. If you are looking for a lawyer to represent you, there may be an organization that would be willing to take your case for free. You can find that out by entering information at his website: ###. If you are looking to hire a lawyer that charges fees for legal help, then a good place to start is this website: ###.       Please don't be frightened by the possibility of hiring a lawyer who charges a fee. From the information you've provided, it sounds like UIC might have committed some form of fraud or consumer fraud regarding your program. Those kinds of cases are often brought as class actions meaning that a lawyer would bring the case on behalf of you and other similarly-situated people, i.e., the other students in your program. Class action fraud cases can be very lucrative for lawyers, so if you have a solid case, a lawyer who charges a fee would be willing to take your case, and the fees would be calculated as some percentage of the money recovered in the lawsuit.  So, you wouldn't really be paying anything. If you reach out to a lawyer who charges a fee, you should describe your case as a potential consumer fraud class action against UIC."

Though my grades remained good and I was a good student, when the time came to take the exam that would allow me to go on to internship (the final step of the program), I barely didn't pass. Which, again, didn't make sense because I had done excellently.Not only did I not pass, but a full third of the class was prevented from going on internship, ### didn't do well enough ###'t find places to send the students to internships. So the ### ###. That time I passed, but was almost not given an interpreting internship because again, they couldn't find anything. I was eventually assigned one and did graduate. Some students who passed the test the first time did not the second time due to nerves, and they could not graduate at all.However, because of their poor handling of my education/internship, I was unable to get employment with Chicago Public Schools, which I had been on track to do, nor did I pass the BEI (licensure test). The school was put under probation shortly after I graduated. (https://www.twincities.com/20###/st-###-college-placed-on-probation-two-months-after-president-quits/).Again, this is a VERY brief explanation of the events. What I want to know is, do I have a case to, at the very least, try and get the money I spent on the degree back? I am not an interpreter now, I have never been a paid interpreter. I'm furious with several people at the college and I'm VERY confident things would have turned out differently both for myself and for several classmates who were competent to interpret if we had been given a better head instructor to work with. We were told by that instructor that if we did not pass, we would have to repeat the year, but this was something else. We were ready. They were not.Thank you for your time--truly. If this is just life, then I can let it go (a little). But to have performed well before the test, find out people who passed the test couldn't go, then for the school to go on probation a year after I graduated? Something isn't right.44216.0916666667 My full name is ### Schroeder-Davis, and I did live in ### full-time while I was taking those classes. (I'm from Mn, I moved to IL when I graduated.)  Again, I truly appreciate your time. I of course don't expect you/anyone to take this case on, I just want to know there is a case here that I should pursue. 44223.86875 I hold stocks since the '###. I would like to compile them into a worksheet that creates an overview of my  holdings. Every purchase and sale would be listed. Could you suggest someone who could recreate these files and put them on a computer? 44222.8923611111 I received a summons regarding a truancy case for my youngest son. In the attached documentation were notices that were mailed notifying of the absences, but both notices were dated the same day (I did not receive these, either) and there was no additional follow-up from the school until I received this summons. Is the school not required to give notification prior to referring to an attorney? I don't have full documentation of all the days missed and I believe that most, if not all, should have been covered by sick notes that I wrote or that were provided by our doctor.I've never had to deal with a situation like this before and I'm not sure where to start or who to ask for documentation of absences.43297.8097222222 Ms. ###,I handle juvenile court cases in ### County, so our process may be a bit different than in ### County.  With that in mind, however, the school usually sends out a letter to the parents saying that your child has missed so many days and is in danger of being referred to the court for truancy.  If the child continues to miss days, the school refers the case to the juvenile group at the prosecuting attorney's office.  At that point, the juvenile officers in ### County would look at the school's records to see if your child does show to have had as many absences as the school believes, to see if there were extenuating circumstances that led to the child missing (like extended illness, etc.), and if there was any other evidence that would be good or bad in the case.  Then, they notify you of a court date via the summons, as you received it in the mail.At this point, you and your child absolutely must apear on the court date in the summons, even if you are going to argue your case that you didn't receive the school notes.  If you do not appear, then they will issue a warrant for your arrest.  You want to avoid this if possible.If you have doctor's notes that haven't been turned in, you should read the policy of the school district to see if you can even turn them in at this point.  Usually the schools will take them a few days after the day is missed but not much after that.  To avoid it in the future, turn those notes in as soon as possible - the next day if at all possible.You should be assigned someone from the public defender's office to represent you in court, but if not, then you can hire a private attorney to help with your case.Truancy cases are hard to defend if the child has actually missed the days, the notes weren't turned in, and there is no valid reason that the child has missed as many days as he or she has.I hope this helps answer your questions.Cordially,### D. ###### Law Firm, PLLC###43318.725 Hi ###,Just a few questions. Did this person have a legal right to remove the child from school on this particular day? If not, did the school have reason to believe the person was authorized to remove the child? Did the person have written permission that had not yet been revoked? Does the school have a process for establishing who may pick up children? Assuming the school had no reason to believe this person had a right to pick up the child, school's generally are only allowed to release children to a parent, legal guardian, or anyone else with written authorization from a parent or legal guardian.You should file an incident report with the police about the pick up of the child and their threatening of you. Whether you'll have an action against the school depends on the answers to the questions above. 43399.8034722222 How do I file a complaint and lawsuit against a public school district? My ###. This person has had a personal vendetta against me for years and has been harassing me off and on. I reported this occurrence to the principal the next day.  That day this person approached me on school property and threatened me. I also reported this occurrence. 43361.00625 For the past couple of years my son has been being bullied at school, we have made contact with the school and nothing has been done.  This has gotten so bad to the point he tried to take his own life at school during recess he is ### 11. If the school does not step and take action what can we do? Please any help is appreciated, he is currently in Premiere behavioral health in west ###. The school said they was going to step in and take control of the situation but if they do not is what I was wondering about.43856.15625 Mr. ###, First, I want to apologize that it has taken so long for someone to get back to you about your concern. This website depends heavily on attorney-volunteers who often have full-time practices as well, so, that's why it has taken so long for someone to get back with you. I'm sorry to hear that your ###0-year-old is suffering from bullying at school. This is totally unacceptable and should never escalate to the point of self-harm. My heart goes out to you and your son.I hope that by now the school district has begun to remedy the situation for you. If they have not, I'll give you a brief overview of what steps you can take to ensure that something is done. You should report all instances of bullying to the school in writing (via email is best because you will be able to show that you have sent information and that they have received it), but if you send it via USPS, I recommend getting a delivery confirmation with each letter that you mail them. Record every instance of bullying in a log that you keep for yourself. This should be as specific as you can make it and include the name of the bully or bullies, what happened, how it started, what harm came to your son (physically or otherwise), who saw this take place, who you reported the incident to, and what the school told you they would do about the bullying. The law allows for group conflict resolution meetings to be called by administration between your son and the bully. Sometimes you have to formally request that this occurs in writing. Request a Safety Plan for your child. These plans are put in place to protect a child who is being bullied at school and it consists of two main parts: ###) the steps the school will take to prevent bullying against your son, and ###) the steps your son will take in situations where bullying does occur. There should be a specific start date on each plan and it includes the entire school day, i.e., from the time that your son gets on the bus or gets dropped of at school until the time that your son gets home or is picked up from school. The plan must also set out a specific staff person that your son can contact to report bullying that occurs. If you follow these steps and nothing happens to help your son, you have three other options. You can do all three, or just one at a time:Send a letter to the school superintendent with your concerns, including specific instances of bullying, what you did, and what the school did or did not do to remedy the situation; Call the Equity Office of the ### Department of Education to let them know what is going on and to ask them for assistance. Their phone number is ###. Make a complaint with the ### Board of Education. This is the option you should take if nothing else seems to work. The following are the names and email addresses of each of the Board members. If you decide to utilize this option (after you've tried the previous two options), I recommend sending a formal email copying all board members in the same email. Include all relevant information and your contact information. Include all the steps you have taken to date and what the school has done or has not done.### Zook, ###. ###### ###. ###### ###. ###### ###. ###Dr. O. ### Hill. ###Ouida ###. ###Dr. ### ###. ###### McFetridge. ###### Pekron. ###Finally, if you can't seem to get any assistance doing these things, you can contact The Center for ### Legal Services and Legal Aid of ### at ###-800-### and speak to an attorney about possibly representing you against the school district in litigation. If it comes to litigation, all of your efforts in ###-###! Finally, if there is no avail after doing all of that, you may contact an attorney who works in education law (you can just google them) to assist you in suing the school for failure to protect your son. I hope this was helpful and that your son's situation improves. Nobody deserves to be bullied. Best, ### L.

If they fail to act after being made aware of the situation they can be liable in addition to the employees who are doing the harassment or bullying. ### also has a bullying law. Recommend detailing specific examples of what was said or done, identify the employee, and ask for assistance addressing the problem. Send the letter to the superintendent. If the child is a special education student, I recommend copying the ### for the district. 44437.59375 My child's school has a ### policy.

Every medical facility has a records request (HIPAA Authorization) that you can fill out or give the pediatrician written authorization to request these records.

School districts across the nation are grappling with how to respond to rising covid numbers given their responsibilities as a provider of public education. Many schools in ### are requiring students to wear ###s in an effort to decrease the spread of covid cases in their district. Does your daughter have any disabilities or medical conditions that make wearing a ### difficult? Discuss options with your daughter's pediatrician. One option is to have her wear a face shield as this does not fit tightly to her face but protects your child and her peers from infection. 44456.7076388889 Are you able to answers some more questions or is this a one question per case?44273.0347222222 Hi ###,I am sorry to hear about your experience. I am sure that it has been very difficult and it has been a hard situation to navigate when you expected the school to be able to accommodate your needs. Illinois is a two-party consent state, which means that it in some circumstances it is illegal to record a conversation unless all parties consent to the recording.

Since the start of the pandemic I have seen there's been a huge stress on my school to the point where I feel like the teachers and staff have started to abuse their authority. I wanted information on what the laws are and what I might be able to do about this situation. My school does not allow electronics during the school day so I have not been able to gather any evidence on what these staff members say. I wanted to know if I would be able to purchase a recording device and secretly record these conversations? They donâ€™t act up outside of school only when it's just the students. My school also metal ### use at the door. I am completely okay with that but they recently told us they will be patting us down. I am a survivor of sexual assault and have PTSD from the events. I went to this school because along with my PTSD I have a few other mental illnesses and I needed an environment that had accommodations for this. Currently not only have I not been getting help but I feel traumatized by certain experiences at that school. I wanted to find a lawyer to help me sort out these situations but Iâ€™m a broke student with no experience. I donâ€™t know where to turn and if there are any resources I would be extremely grateful. 44267.6118055556 Thank you ### this absolutely helps me moving forward.

When I took Adult Health I course I faced a situation in school that I strongly believe can support my defense to have loan forgiven. My instructor misrepresented education services- telling students to share notes looks to each otherâ€™s exams for answers open books and own notes. Her unprofessional behavior violated schools educational integrity code of conduct and schools overall mission. She was asked to leave class and school academic coordinator took control over class walking asking questions taking students phone numbers. His behavior was disrespectful disturbing and made me very uncomfortable finishing the exam. I lost focus and score low on the exam. More to it the school graded exams unequally, same course different classes were graded as follows: my class got interrupted and test were submit based on that other classes were able to use notes share answers and pass course with grade ### ! The school provided unequal opportunity taking exams for the same course to students ! Academic advisor instructors ### assistant ### student success advisor did not help me resolve this issue. I have multiple emails supporting my situation. 44278.7569444444 Hello, I want to know how to go about getting my certificates from my prior instructor for High Priestess and Clairvoyant. I took ### $1000. I graduated ###th ###, I have all videos and conversations form start of meeting the instructor. She stated that she was waiting on my certificates but gave me my registered High Priestess number from ###. In October she blocked me on all social media and phone for no apparent reason and block anyone I have to try and contact her. Please inform on the next legal step I should take.44279.5479166667 Hello,No, all communication was through messages and verbal/ phone, and in person but no signatures to any forms. The certificates are important towards the services I provide to the public and to show my legitimacy. She states the High Priestess number is my registration number in ### and I have the messages of the registration number she sent me. Last I spoke to her there were no issues on our end just her personal life and I told her my job may be moving out of state due to COVID and I may be moving and I sent her the address to send my certificates and she said ok and congratulated me. Then very next day Iâ€™m blocked on everything and from any contact I try to use other people number and she blocks them. I do not know of any other affiliates to contact for my certificates.44284.7791666667 Hello,Tracking stated that she returned the certified letter to sender. What next steps should I pursue?44292.1458333333 Here's my suggested rewrite. I think you're on the right path with this, and would just encourage you to frame it as a polite I" letter because the next step after this would probably be a more strongly worded third-person ("she") attorney letter. Also include your contact info yet again to help demonstrate that you are not preventing her from contacting you.RE: ### ### High Priestess and Psychic CertificatesDear Mrs. Marlisha ###:I am writing you because I have not yet received the High Priestess and Psychic Certificates that I have been waiting for since ###.As you will recall we last discussed this issue on ### at which time you agreed to mail my certificates to me at ### ### IL ###.

I need some more information to figure out what is going on and what legal options you might have.First, can you share copies of the course agreements? Did you sign any contracts? Can you explain a little more about the High Priestess number you received?Second, was there anything that led up to the blocking? It will help me advise you to know what was said.Third, can you help me understand the importance of the certificates? Are they necessary for certain services you wish to provide to the community, and do you need them to show your affiliation or legitimacy? Is there a centralized authority that you can order them from separately or do you need this person's agreement?Looking forward to helping you work through this issue.44280.6423611111 I am sorry that you are dealing with this situation and would strongly suggest you plan to find a way forward that does not rely on getting the certificates.Your options at this point are probably a) to work with the Center for Conflict Resolution to see if getting a neutral third party involved will help you, and b) to file a lawsuit, which may be expensive and also not end up with the result you want.The problem if you take this to court is going to be showing that you are entitled to the certificate. Did you find any additional screenshots or information that would show that she promised you the certificate as part of a specific payment?44299.99375 I have attached all the cash app payments I made for the training.44284.9284722222 I have attached the certified letter I am going to send to her. Your thoughts will help if appropriate for you to inform on.44286.6104166667 I have it via social media on video of my graduation and screen shot of her posting sheâ€™s ### of me. I would never let her take my power, I have attached documents for you.  I am upset that I paid this woman over $###â€™t give me my certificates even though I have proof she needs to have some integrity and consideration for others outside of her ### attitude. Please inform on your thoughts.44284.8986111111 I sent off the certified letter yesterday she should get it on Saturday 44288.7645833333 Just following up as there had been a website issue where some people were not receiving notifications. I want to be sure that you know that legal help is available for this question, but that it will be closed after approximately ten days if you do not respond. Hoping all has already worked out wonderfully for you! 44284.6993055556 She stated La ### ### but not the organization name. I attached the text she sent me.I have all communication with her and all payments I made through cash app. I have her last address I know of in ###20.44284.8569444444 Thank you for all of these!You definitely do have documentation from the screenshot that she was going to be sending you the certificates. However, one legal issue that I see is proving that she agreed to provide you with the certificates specifically as part of the money you spent for a particular training. Also, it is hard to quantify the damages from the failure to provide you with the certificates. One more difficulty would be the fact that because of COVID-related delays in courts, it is possible that it would not only be expensive to file a case to address your issue but also take a long time, with the possibility of getting nothing out of it.I am going to do some more legal research for you on these issues and will get back to you later this week with more details. At present, I think there are two separate ways of approaching the legal claim - breach of contract and specific performance - but I haven't seen enough information that would support getting enough a judgment in your favor to make it worthwhile.One possibility that would be worth exploring is contacting the Center for Conflict Resolution, https://www.ccrchicago.org/ to see if they could set up a mediation, since you have her address. They contact potential parties by email or snail mail and have lots of expertise in ### small claims disputes.Another option is to send a letter to her by certified mail explaining politely that you are still waiting on your certificates, need them for providing your services, and are talking with legal counsel about how to pursue the matter. Because this is a virtual legal clinic, I can't take actions on your behalf outside the website, but you can also look for an affordably priced lawyer who would be willing to do this for you. The important part is that the letter would have to be extremely calm and carefully worded to avoid coming across as threatening, because there is a good chance that if this later ended up in litigation that it would end up being part of a court file.I will update you once I've looked into the specific legal issues around this. Thank you again for sending the images because they really do help with puzzling out how a court would evaluate the situation. If you can find any more conversations or documentation, please feel free to attach them and I will review them after I have done some legal research for you.44284.9368055556 Thank you. I'm trying to do some research on her right now and one thing is for sure, all of her clairvoyant-related sites are not loading! I will update you as to what I figure out, if anything.If you can find something showing where she promised you the certificate originally, that would be helpful. There seems to be some unpleasant web chatter about a Marlisha ###; not sure if it's the same person, but look at the Yelp reviews for a doula service by someone with the same name.My practical suggestion would be to figure out how to market your services by focusing on having completed training, but not worry about the certificates right now. (Don't give your power away to this woman who didn't give you a certificate!) However, I am going to keep looking into this and will let you know what I can figure out.44284.8659722222 Thanks so much for your feedback on the letter. I will rewrite and let you know.44286.6722222222 Thatâ€™s why I wrote the payment reason in the cash app and the dates are attached. I have all messages of the course communication that will coincide with my payments. Thanks for your help, please let me know what you find.44284.9444444444 This is her address attached.44284.9027777778 Where would you be registered with in ###? Is there some kind of parent organization? The first step might be to contact them and find out whether the registration number she provided you was valid.Do you have a mailing address for your instructor?Also, it's not necessary to have signed forms to figure out what she agreed to provide you with. Do you have messages saved that would show where she agreed to provide the certificates? For example, was there a course description that you can show you paid for, or anything similar?44284.8361111111 Yes, I have all communication with her from the first day of meeting her. I have all the proof that she owes me ###. I have her site as well that she uses to draw people for the class. I have all the payments made. I have everything. I also have witnesses.44300.4666666667 Hi ###.      Thanks for reaching out with your question. Medical billing is a legitimate profession. Health care providers rely on their medical billers to use the correct codes when submitting claims for reimbursement to insurance companies, Medicare, and Medicaid. As long as the correct codes are used and providers are not charging for services that are medically necessary and actually provided, the process is legal.       I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.44289.85625 Im taking a few classes in college for medical billing. I'm not sure if this field is even legal because it is billing people outrageous amounts of money for procedures that the person has to get done. For ###. I just need some counsel and pointed in the right direction to ask someone who cared about this matter with putting money aside. I live in ### Illinois. My parents live down stairs. I don't have a pending case I'm just asking questions44288.13125 Hi Jenina:I am sorry to hear you are going through this. I know it must be a very difficult  and frustrating situation. Unfortunately there are many situations where a school classifies something as a weapon or a look alike" where it is not the case. From what you have provided here it seems like your child was not suspended out of school which is usually something that happens before an expulsion. But the "meeting" the administration is referring to is pretty vague. Of course your son needs to be careful about what he will bring to school but kids often bring things to show their friends. I would emphasize to the school that it is not something that can harm anyone. I wanted to give you some information and then give you two possibilities of places to call that specialize in this type of law and can hopefully provide you some guidance or possible representation. There is a very specific notice that is required before an expulsion hearing and it doesn't not seem like the email is that notice. The handbook from your district states: ###. Before a student may be expelled the student and his or her parent(s)/guardian(s) shall be provided a written request to appear at a hearing to determine whether the student should be expelled. The request shall be sent by registered or certified mail return receipt requested. The request shall: a) include the time date and place for the hearing; b) briefly describe what will happen during the hearing; c) detail the specific act of gross disobedience or misconduct resulting in the decision to ### & ### http://boardpolicyonline.com/? b=park_ridge_niles_###; d) list the ### prior suspension(s); e) state that the School Code allows the School Board to expel a student for a definite period of time not to exceed ### as determined on a case by case basis; f) ask that the student or parent(s)/guardian(s) or attorney inform the Superintendent or Board Attorney if the student will be represented by an attorney and if so the attorneyâ€™s name and contact information.It is possible that this meeting is just to decide on next steps but you are right to be very cautious. If expulsion is mentioned at all I would tell the school that you are trying to find legal help and so you need more advanced notice of any date and to know for sure what the school is proposing. Has your son been in trouble before? If not that and his age are important considerations as to why he should not be referred for expulsion. You also mentioned ADHD. Does he have a ###? Those are also important facts because there could be a different disciplinary process. I am also sorry to hear about the discrimination you and your son experienced. Unfortunately that is all too common. There should be an official way to make a complaint about harassment to the school and there are usually some other options as well. You may want to pursue that after this is resolved as it can be hard to address it all at once and you want to make sure that your son misses as little school as possible. I would call these places today if you can. If you are unable to reach anyone before the meeting I would not agree to anything that you are not comfortable with and definitely not agree to go forward with an expulsion hearing. But they may just be proposing suspension. That is also something you can appeal although it is harder. Here are the two organizations (I would contact them in this order):### for Equality Special Education Clinic: Call the Helpline at ###-866-### or email ###. You can find more information about school discipline here: https://www.###forequality.org/issues/special-education/special-education-issues/discipline/Legal Aid Chicago: Get Help by Applying Online or calling 3###2-###. I would provide them with the picture and email you have provided here and be sure to mention the meeting tomorrow morning. I wish you the best and let me know if I can provide any more information. Sincerely###"44292.7173611111 Hi, we live in Park Ridge IL where my son goes to school. At the moment he is facing possible expulsion because he brought something to school called a Balisong trainer. He got it as a gift from his dad a long time ago, and he brought it to show another friend in school who has one as well - and has also been bringing it and showing off the tricks they know, on the bus.A balisong trainer is like a butterfly knife but with no ### whatsover, but it has metal rods held together by a mechanism that allows the tool to spin like one. It is for practicing tricks. On ###, it is not only listed as not real and not sharp" but also described as "suitable for beginners and teens. Butterfly knife practice blade is safe and easy to use. The knife can't be sharpened due to its design."I got an email from the principal and vice principal who are now saying we need to show up to a hearing and show the tool and now he may be facing serious consequences over it. My son's father is telling me now to show the item because they will try to expel him with that but IT IS NOT A WEAPON.  That doesn't make sense to me. Also this school failed to call me when my son got bullied by a girl at school and called a racial slur. We are ### and she specifically called him "a dirty chink". We have experienced discrimination in this neighborhood but am worried if there is some sort of agenda here to ### my son over the most harmless thing? My son also reports showing ### "looked cool."My child has been diagnosed with ADHD but is otherwise normal healthy and happy and quite social now - he expressly wanted to start coming to school post-lockdown so he could see and make new friends again. The "meeting" is on Wednesday over Zoom in the morning."44291.9493055556 Hello Ms Ziegel,I am sorry to hear about that situation and I know it must be very difficult for you and your son. Is the IEP in a pdf format? If so you should be able to attach it but I know you said it didn't allow you to do so. If you are able to I am happy to take a look at it for you. When you move to a new district, the district doesn't have to implement the IEP exactly as it was. But it can be frustrating when the district is not implementing it properly. It does sound like might need additional supports and a behavior intervention plan. Sometimes it can help to get an independent expert to review My recommendation would be to contact ### for Equality, that helps parents with these exact kinds of issues. They can review the evaluation reports and the IEP. You can reach them here:  1-866-KIDS-046  and learn more about the Helpline here: https://www.###forequality.org/issues/special-education/helpline/. You can also send an email to ###. An attorney will be able to review the situation with you and determine how they might be able to assist. The legal help is free. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to let me know that or if you have any additional information. I wish you the best. Sincerely,###44328.7319444444 Hello, My name is ### Ziegel. My son qualified for special education services at the beginning of the pandemic ###. He has an outside diagnosis of ADHD and ODD.  We transferred school districts in August of ###. I have multiple concerns regarding the ### of the IEP in this school. They reduced the reading intervention minutes from ### ###. He does not receive math support, even though school psychologist reports him below average. He has no aid, even though that is recommended. He doesn't have a behavior plan even though there are behaviors reported. His current grades state below basic understanding" yet he doesn't have the special education services to assist him throughout the day. My son was banned from the before school program due to behaviors. Now I have no means to get him to school in the morning since I work early. He has been attending virtually but at ### this is not appropriate. They said they would let him come back to the before care program in August but later on changed that to October because "they want to see how he behaves in school" however without this program he will not be able to attend in person school. I need my child to get back into this program and once he is in there I need to make sure that the supports in place will help him be successful. I continually tell the school and this organization how I feel but because I don't fully understand the process and feel as though I am not being heard and my child is being discriminated against because of his disability. I tried to attach his current IEP but it said the attachment wouldn't allow me to do so. "44320.7652777778 Dear FNU Khulood: Thank you for your question.

As I was not provided the classes and experiences for which I paid.44410.1944444444 ### Lake , IL wauconda school district ###I have two children that have suffered from bullying at the school district. Everyone gaslights and doesnâ€™t do anything. I made several reports, emailed superintendent, teachers, special education case managers, principals, school social workers and no one helps. My daughter suffered four years of complete abuse to the point she has made herself so ill she canâ€™t function. The school finally paid for her to go to a special school. Now my son, same school as my daughter, is getting shoved by a kid, intimidation by other children and isolating him. Both kids have ptsd and are harassed daily. My middle daughter has suffered horribly and now itâ€™s happening to my son. Same school, same district. This is taking a toll on the whole family. Literally causing us serious distress to where we are all in therapy and see a psychiatrist. When you tell the teacher, principal they use gaslighting as a form of manipulation of the situation. Both my kids have IEPâ€™s for autism, anxiety, ### disorder and other issues. If they wonâ€™t stop it we need help sending a message to stop it.   44428.4104166667 Ms. Paddock,I am so sorry to hear about your son and daughter. I would suggest reaching out to Loyola University Chicago School of Law as they have a program that focuses on cases surrounding bullying. You can reach them at https://www.luc.edu/law/studentlife/organizations/sufeostandupforeachother/. Aside from Loyola, you may wish to contact the Illinois State Board of Education to file a formal complaint: ### or the U.S. Department of ### Office of Civil Rights - https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/howto.html. I hope this helps. All the best,###44428.7444444444 Ms. Paddock,I am so sorry to hear. You definitely can file a report with the police although we cannot advise on criminal issues on Illinois Free Legal Answers. Here are the elements for criminal battery, so you can have the information: https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/072000050K12-3.htm. I do think your best course of action is to get in touch with Loyola, the Illinois State Board of Education, and the U.S. Department of Education. They are the experts in handling these types of situations. While the police may speak with the child who spat your child - I am not sure that it would solve the larger issue, which sounds like a school administration who is not protecting students - in particular, your son and daughter - from bullying. All my best,###44432.60625 Ms. Paddock,I wish you and your children the best. I was also bullied in school, so I have some sense of how it feels. I genuinely hope that someone can resolve this issue for you. If you need any further resources, please feel free to contact me at ###. All the best,###44432.6104166667 Ok. I reached out to ISBE, the regional Superintendent and Loyola. I will also contact the US Department of Education.

I know that they have often helped with enrollment issues. Another place that I would reach out to is Legal Aid Chicago as they have an education-law clinic, here: https://www.legalaidchicago.org/contact-us/.

The school refuses to supply video of this and my son denies it. 44433.7402777778 There's no way to know for sure, but based on the way covid exposure is being handled, it is likely that someone who has covid (whose name is being kept confidential) identified your son as having been exposed to him (or her).Have your son get a covid test and if it comes back negative ask to have the ### lifted.  As a practical matter there's not much else you can do.44433.7555555556 Dear ###:It is so unfortunate that your granddaughter was required to quarantine due to possible covid exposure.  I hope that she is well.  I assume that your granddaughter is not vaccinated.  I assume that Westmore School is in Lombard, IL.The Village of Lombardâ€™s website does not include a local Health Department, so I assume that your concern is governed by the ### County Health Department.According to the ### County Health Departmentâ€™s current website, the local health department makes the final determination on who is to be quarantined and for how long.  Note that the regulations and procedures involving covid change continually and these current regulations and procedures may differ from those in effect when your granddaughter was exposed.What options are available for unvaccinated students to return to school from quarantine after an exposure? The local health department will make the final determination on who is to be quarantined and for how long. They also may determine that a close contact is not a candidate for modified quarantine due to a high-risk exposure (e.g., sustained close contact without ###ing).Option ###: Quarantine at home for ###. Date of last exposure is considered day 0.Option ###: Quarantine for ###â€™s last exposure to the COVID-###. Date of last exposure is considered day 0.The individual may end quarantine after day ###-###.SARS-CoV-###.The individual can maintain physical distancing and ###ing at all times when returning to school; for classrooms where ###ing is strictly adhered to as required, physical distance of ### ###.Option ###: Quarantine period is for seven calendar days after the last exposure if:No symptoms developed during daily monitoring AND the individual has a negative SARS-CoV-### (PCR) that was collected within ### 7 (starting on day ###).The individual is responsible for obtaining a copy of the negative results for documentation purposes.The individual can maintain physical distancing and ###ing at all times when returning to school; for classrooms where ###ing is strictly adhered to as required, physical distance of ### ###.Option ###:Test to Stay Strategy, as has been documented by ###, if schools test close contacts, as defined above, on days one, three, five, and seven from date of exposure by a PCR or rapid antigen or molecular emergency use authorization (EUA)-approved test, close contacts are permitted to remain in the classroom as long as the results are negative. (See IDPHâ€™s Interim Guidance on Testing for COVID-###.)Test to Stay is only applicable when both the COVID-###9-confimed case and close contact were engaged in consistent and correct use of well-fitting ###s, regardless of vaccination status (universal ###ing), as required by Executive Order ###0######-###8.Test to Stay may be used for any indoor exposure, with the exception of household ###, for both students and staff who are not fully vaccinated.Students or staff who are not fully vaccinated and engaged in Test to Stay after an exposure may participate in extracurricular activities. Local health departments have the authority to order a classroom-only Test-to-Stay protocol after assessing the risk of an individual situation.However, if the close contact is identified five days or more from the date of exposure, adjust testing accordingly, ideally on days five and seven after the last exposure.When testing in the outlined cadence is not possible due to weekends and holidays, students and staff who are not fully vaccinated should be tested at the earliest possible opportunity.At the conclusion of the Test to Stay modified quarantine period, the school should notify the local health department that the individual has successfully completed testing and remained negative.Local health departments have the authority to assess high-risk ### and order a traditional quarantine without the option for Test to Stay.If at any time the student tests positive or becomes symptomatic, they should be immediately ###d and sent home, and the local health department notified.Regardless of when an individual ends quarantine, daily symptom monitoring should continue through calendar day ###. Individuals should continue to adhere to recommended mitigation strategies, including proper and consistent ### use, physical distancing, hand hygiene, cough hygiene, environmental cleaning and disinfection, avoiding crowds and sick people, and ensuring adequate indoor ventilation. If any symptoms develop during or after ending quarantine, the individual should immediately self-### and contact their local health department or healthcare provider to report their symptoms. The health department can provide guidance on how to safely quarantine and ### within the household.I suggest that you contact the ### County Health Department (###) and ask if what the school did in your granddaughterâ€™s situation was correct at the time.  And, if it was not correct, ask how you can make a complaint.  If you want to discuss this issue further with an attorney, you may contact ### State Legal Services (if you are eligible and they can take your case).

My daughter tried to call me but she was crying inconsolable. She did not start the conflict, she just ### herself.  The school made her sign documents without me being present. The school never notified me of this even though the handbook is very clear about it. Not only the school did not notify me but they refused to talk to me, I had to make an appt for next day. When i went to talk to the principals, they said that even though the boy had initiated the conflict, it was completely irrelevant. When I asked how come you didn't call me when all this was happening? How come the boy's parents had an opportunity to press charges? I asked to see the video, they refused. The school hasn't been able to give me a satisfactory answer. My daughter had to endure all this ordeal alone, scared, crying. The report written by the school does not include the start, that is the main component of the problem. Minimizes the boy's actions and exagerates my child's involvement. The only way to know the truth is seeing the video but the school refuses to show it to me. When I got to the detention center I asked to be with my daughter that I didn't want her to be interrogated without me being present. The officer said Oh no that's not going to happen she's just being booked. I asked what do you mean by being booked, what is the process? she replied oh you know just a record to show that she was here in and out. I accepted her response thinking that my child was just signing a log.  When an officer came to take me inside i told him i do not want you to interrogate or question my daughter without me being present. He said, Oh no, not at all, someone will come and get you to explain the process.

All this without my knowledge or consent.44495.9333333333 Hello ###,Thank you for using Illinois Free Legal Answers. I noticed that this question is a bit old, so I apologize for the wait. I took a look at the Illinois School Student Records Act. It looked like the remedy for a violation of the act is described in ### ###. It is possible to file a case asking the court for injunctive relief (which basically means that you'd be asking the court to compel someone to do or not do something). There is also the possibility of recovering money as compensation for any harm that came from a violation of the Act, in addition to court costs and attorneys fees, if that violation was done willfully or negligently. If you decide to file, it would be in the Circuit Court for the County where the violation took place. The State Board of Education or State Attorney's Office also has the authority to bring this type of a case in Circuit Court. There's not a guarantee that they would, but you could potentially reach out to them to let them know of the situation. I hope this helps you!Warm Regards,### Schumann44557.2854166667 School district board and their representatives violated ISSRA Illinois School Student Records Act (### 10/6) (from Ch. ###, par. ###)  and ### on multiple occasions.Last occasion, despite warnings not to publicly disclose ### of minor, did so in open session on record. School board stated intent to do so again. Due to conflict of interests, attorney in this specialty for advice cannot be found for consult. What can I do to stop further wonton disclosures of child's ### and violations of ISSRA? 44501.975 My daughter has been experiencing bullying at school for about ###'t handling it. My daughter has a boy in her class named ### who has been harassing her and intentionally hurting her. He walks pass her and elbows her everyday; last year he was running into her, knocking her down, and intimidating her. The school put someone in class last year to supervise him but it wasn't consistent and he would continue bullying her when he wasn't being monitored. The school keeps putting them in the same class each grade level. My daughter has been very sad and anxious at school and her grades are dropping. There was other situations where her clothes keep getting stolen and the school did nothing. She told me several times she has told a teacher but they ignored and dismissed her, even in a case of sexual ### from that male student and another. Not one teacher or school official ever came to me with any concerns my daughter brought up, not even a call from the school. I want to take legal action against the parent and the school. She has an IEP and I talked with the school before about it. There told her to avoid him but he is targeting her and there's no regard to his behavior. I don't see a resolution happening with the school and their tactics because they are negligent.44509.7166666667 There is no legal basis for a claim against the school district.  The school district is an arm of the state and is immune from suit.  The only exception would be bullying that involved discrimination due to race or national origin, in which case suit could be brought based on federal anti-discrimination statutes.You could bring an action against the parent for money damages, subject to the following limitations:The damages must be actual damages" meaning  expenses like medical bills resulting from injuries caused by an assault payment for property damage caused by vandalism and other losses that can be easily quantified. "Actual damages" does NOT main "pain and suffering" or "mental anguish.The only kind of legal remedy you can seek is "actual damages".  The court cannot order the buyllying to stop or order the parent to stop it."44509.7548611111 A school that denied my enrollment is suing me for leaving a fake" ###.

Not sure what more I can tell you. You can't unsend the emails.  If you have done your best to remove the reviews, it is out of your hands.   you have done all you can do.44514.0895833333 Understood. Thank you so much for your time sir and happy holidays.44514.0902777778 the answer to your question is yes, the school could sue you for defamation.  I am not saying that the suit would be succcessful, only that it is possible.The Illinois Supreme Court has defined defamation as follows:A defamatory statement is a statement that harms a person's reputation to the extent it lowers the person in the eyes of the community or ### the community from associating with her or him."Whether or not your review is defamatory (slander the ### used in the letter)is a form of defamation) would have to be de###ined by a judge if a lawsuit is filed.  I understand it's your opinion but that does not necessarily shield you from liability.  An opinion can be defamatory.  The right to express one's feelings and opinions is not absolute.As I read the letter the lawyer is tellling you that the school will consider litigation only if you don't remove the review.  I would therefore sugges that if you don't want to be suied you should remove the review."44513.9611111111 Good afternoon Chicago public school programs there is a program for temporary living that Chicago public school ### the proper name is STLS program Every Chicago public elementary or high school has a different citywide  coordinator I have three children attending three different schools in Chicago Illinois one Chicago public high school one Chicago Public charter high school and one Chicago public elementary schoolI had filled out forms to get my children into the STLS program back in September The charter school and elementary school counselors and STLS ### for these schools told me that my children qualify for the programfrom the Chicago public high school the counselor told me that my son qualifies for the program also but a day later I did get a call back from this one counselor telling me that her boss meaning the STLS coordinator had called her and told her that my son does not qualify and this particular coordinator took it upon herself to call my other two childrenâ€™s schools and get my other two children pulled from the programthis particular coordinator that is not working for Chicago police department but for Chicago public school as a program coordinator was making up lies to why my children do not qualify for the program so she took it up on herself to run a background check on me for wanting to sign my children up for a temporary living program so my question here is does a citywide chlorinator have a right to do a background check and students and their parents because we are not Chicago public school employees for her to run a background check44551.8902777778 Hi ###, I am sorry that you are feeling frustrated. Do you know if she ran an actual criminal background check or if she googled you? The STLS Liaison at the school does need to ask about your living situation in order to determine eligibility, but should not delve into unnecessary information. You may file a dispute with the CPS STSL Department. The Department will then try to resolve in a timely manner through the STLS dispute resolution process. If you need assistance completing the dispute resolution form, I recommend reaching out to the STLS ### at the other ###. They are supposed to help.Attached is a guide to the dispute resolution process and the STLS FAQ. The STLS FAQ includes a section that describes the dispute process as well on page 5.I hope this is helpful. Please let me know if you have further questions.44560.11875 I am an Illinois resident and in my third year of a ### Illinois pharmacy program. I need help figuring out how to find a lawyer who can assist me with this problem that I have been having with my school. I have only a few grand saved up and I am hoping that, at most, I will have to have an attorney send my school a letter and they will let me finish my ### in peace. I am not trying to sue and get rich here. I also have a learning disability and am registered with the ### here and come from a very abusive family that I am low-contact with but cannot afford to completely cut off because they pay for my schooling and the only other option would be to become saddled with massive amounts of debt. The school is aware of both of these things and that they are factors that negatively impact my ability to focus on classes. My school is very big on professionalism" to the point that they pretty rigidly police behavior between students and anyone else in the community. Note that is this a very broad ### that can ### anything from major ethical violations to simply not being formal enough. Now I have been routinely been getting in trouble for "professionalism" reasons. None of these violations are amount to anything other than unintentional ### passes me being outspoken regarding something I disagree with and cases in which me and the other party can both be considered in the wrong but I did not bother to complain about the event while the other did and they were able to spin the narrative in their favor. Now I have a feeling that I will be brought before this school tribunal again that handles discipline and awards recognition once winter break ends. This tribunal would be me trying to defend myself before pharmacy faculty who are undoubtedly biased in favor of their colleagues and a non-voting student representative. Needless to say it did not go well for me the first time around as my words fell on deaf ears. I tried filing reports against faculty to Student Affairs that I believe have been unfair and unprofessional towards me but they did not take me seriously and I lost faith in the system. I have five exams in the first week we are back from break (###) ### and I am worried this drama will hurt my ability to take them and progress academically. I have made the ### List every quarter so it is not like I am a bad student but I keep getting harassed over ### and it has hurt my ability to focus on classes made me extremely depressed and unable to care for myself physically and I have even debated taking my own life.

However, it is not clear to me from your statement what the basis is for a claim of discrimination.A legal claim for discrimination requires, among other things, proof that (###) you have been treated worse than other people in the same position as you, (###) ### the difference in treatment is was based on race, gender or national origin, and (###) that you are worse off as a result of the differential treatment than you otherwise would have been.I cannot see in your statement  facts that if proven would establish a discrimination claim. 44564.9069444444 My name is ### ### and I am/was a pharmacy student at the University of new England College of Pharmacy until I was dismissed in middle may.

The reply I got was you don't want your pharmacist to have gotten all C-" This semester I got a D in a course which is grounds to repeat a course which is what i was told when i met with the ### and the following monday i received an email that i was being kicked out. I know for a fact several students have failed multiple classes year after year and they have not been dismissed from the program. is this grounds to take legal action as i feel as though I am being wrongly dismissed. I also appealed one exam grade explaining that during that exam block my mom had to have heart surgery so i was a little distracted. That appeal was denied because it did not show evidence of grade miscalculation however someone else appealed an exam for personal reasons and they are being given a chance to remediate an exam. I feel as though I have not been given a fair shot because from the very first meeting the ### told me that the I would not win my appeal because I am a C student. She also said that because I was a C student I would have probably failed out eventually or if I did graduate I would not be able to pass the NAPLEX. Is that grounds for like a lawsuit?
