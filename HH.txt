My stage play is being used without my consent by a producer, ### ### ###. (face book name ### ### ###) in Dayton Ohio. I live in North Carolina. I decided not to do the play with him because we did not write a contract and he did not write one so I wrote one, but I did not get a chance to send it to him before I decided not to do the play because we had too many disagreements. Today I saw that he is still putting on my play under a different title, â€œYou Donâ€™t Know My Storyâ€. To be shown in August. I saw the promo on You Tube, You ### My Story promo by ### ###. He even has a page of the script showing. I need to know what to do about this. PLEASE HELP ME! I tried to copyright it, but I did something wrong when I sent it in. He is planning on doing my play in August at a church. I would like to have some advice on what to do to stop him from putting on my play.

If you bought your property and had a closing attorney, you could pay for a little time from that attorney to review the old title work to make sure the horse farm has a right to use the road or an obligation to help with maintenance. If there is no help there, consider what County regulation might help.  If this is a business, see what type of county regulations might apply and be helpful.  Start in the county zoning office and find out which office regulates businesses and sells privilege licenses.  This business has customers coming and going in what is probably zoned as a residential area.  You might be able to find out that there are some violations.  Before you file a complaint, however, you should go talk to the owner to let him know you are serious about getting a remedy.  Give him a chance to get customers to slow down without government interference.As a last resort  --  How about a few speed bumps?

The people that run this horse farm have their customers flying up and down the road just tearing it up.

We have posted signs but to no avail, it hasnâ€™t helped one bit. We have paid money to repair the road and they have refused to ### in.

In order to fully answer your question, it would be helpful to know whether the lease that you signed specifically requires that you pay for carpet cleaning when you move out and that you use a cleaning company that the landlord chooses, or if the lease does not require this and the landlord is simply saying you need to pay to have the carpet cleaned because the landlord is alleging that you have damaged it.Unfortunately, if the lease that you signed specifically requires this, then you have essentially already agreed to pay to have the carpet cleaned and to use a cleaning company of the landlord's choosing.  You might try showing the landlord that the carpet is in fine ### need to be cleaned, asking if the landlord will let you clean it yourself, or seeing if the landlord will let you use a different carpet cleaning company that doesn't cost as much.  However, again, if you already agreed to this in the lease you signed it might be tough to argue that you don't have to get the carpet cleaned.On the other hand, if there is nothing in the lease that says that you will pay to have the carpet cleaned when you move out or that requires you to use a cleaning company of the landlord's choosing, you might have a strong argument that you don't need to pay to have the carpet cleaned at all.  In this situation the landlord could try to argue that you damaged the carpet, and then take money out of your security deposit to pay for the cleaning.  However, you should not be responsible for (and the landlord shouldn't be able to use your security deposit to pay for) ordinary wear and tear items like worn, old or dirty carpeting.  That being said, what constitutes ordinary wear and tear" is determined on a case by case basis so your landlord could try to argue that you damaged the carpet beyond ordinary wear and tear (for example if you left it full of stains).  It doesn't hurt to let the landlord know that you're aware of the law that you believe that this constitutes ordinary wear and tear and you're willing to go to small claims court to get your security deposit back if they try to keep it.  I also note that the landlord has to return the security deposit to you within a specific period of time after the lease ends (or provide you with an accounting of how the deposit was appropriately applied) and if the landlord doesn't properly do so in the time required you are entitled to get the entire deposit back.I've attached a couple of links below that provide some helpful information on this subject and would recommend that you read them.###/###I hope this was helpful and wish you the best of luck.Thank you."43644.76875 I signed a lease last year for a property I currently rent. They require that the clients pay for carpet cleaning from a single, specific carpet cleaning company upon move out or else the cleaning will be charged as additional rent." Is it legal for them to require this especially from a specific cleaning company? The cleaning is estimated to cost roughly $300. The carpet cleaning company also provides a discount for renters from my specific leasing company but this seems useless given that we are bound to their services in the lease. Thank you."43642.7458333333 I am sorry you are going through this.  It is irrelevant that she never paid rent.  You are still her Landlord.  You can still evict her.  She is a tenant at Will."  This is the ### you will use in Court.  Give her a ###. Be sure to keep a copy.  When she does not leave you will need to go to the Clerk's Office in your local Courthouse and file a Summary Ejectment proceeding.  The Clerk will give you fill-in-the blank forms.  Fill them out showing zero rent and stating she is a "tenant at will" and has "held over" after notice to vacate was given.  You will get your Court date as soon as you file the action.  The Sheriff will serve these papers on her.  Good luck. "43668.1027777778 She was a addict in recovery and we allowed her and baby to stay with us. She is done with her program.

During this time I was just finishing school, and would eventually begin work on ###th. Work that the landlord (American Homes ###) said would be done by the time I moved in was not done, and they requested that I make a request for maintenance on the home. Their maintenance requests are only available from ### ###.I complied, made the appointment, and when the repair man came he did not complete all of the requested repairs. So, I made another maintenance request. This time, the repair man comes and only fixes one issue, and says he doesn't have the necessary parts for the rest. So I rescheduled a third time, and was left with the same result. I have a form from American homes ### ###th stating that they are aware of the issues, and to date The kitchen sink faucet does not work, a light switch does not work, the mailbox isn't attached to the post outside and frequently falls off of the post, and one of the closets is missing a doorknob. They have suggested I reschedule again for repairs, but throughout the time I was available between school and work (from the beginning of may to ###th) the repairs were not done during the three separate visits when I was available during the work week. Now that I am working, I don't feel that it is appropriate that I lose money by taking time off of work when these issues have been known about for two months, and I called my property manager with this complaint. He said that maintenance requests are completed through a third party company and his hands were tied. He did, ask me to send a list of needed repairs, and he would try to address the issues. I complied and haven't received a response in over a week.So I have two questions: ###) Is it within my rights to withhold all or part of the rent until the repairs are done, or ###) Should I have the repairs done myself and send American Homes ###. Thank you for your time and advice. 43644.6263888889 Mr. ###:Thanks for your question; aside from these inconveniences, I hope your summer has otherwise been a rewarding one.  I ### with your dwindling patience with these repeated failures to repair all defective conditions of your rented home.  Here are some general things to consider based on North Carolina landlord-tenant law:First, North Carolina does not allow tenants to unilaterally withhold rent without court order (N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-44(c)).  So in this circumstance, your remedies would be the following: (###) demand an immediate rent concession for the time period in which your repair/maintenance requests have gone unaddressed, since the time the landlord had actual notice of the issues; (###) sue the landlord in small claims court for breach of the implied warranty of habitability under N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-4###, and request as your legal relief a rent abatement for the period since the landlord's actual notice of the issues (and in which the issues have not been adequately addressed); or (###) have the repairs done yourself or by someone you hire, then demand reimbursement or rent abatement as compensation for your ###.  If you withhold rent without the landlord's permission or without court order, the landlord can sue to evict you for nonpayment of rent (although you could still counterclaim for habitability breaches under the statute), and would succeed in removing you from the premises.Should you decide to sue in small claims, you would need to plan for (###) a payment of $96.###, and (###) a payment of $TERM00133### Department, as the service of process fee for the civil complaint and summons to be served upon the landlord.Also, read Â§ 4###-###: https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_4###/gs_4###-4###.html.  When calculating time for a rent abatement request, keep in mind that the clock begins when the landlord has actual knowledge" of the issues to be repaired and has had a "reasonable time" to address them.  Generally the small claims magistrate who would hear your case will give the landlord a little space to show good faith so do not be surprised if the landlord gets a week or two as a grace period to repair before liability is imputed to the same.  Rent abatement is generally calculated as fair rental value in good condition minus fair rental value in defective condition plus any special damages the tenant incurred as a direct result of the landlord's habitability breach.The more that you and the landlord can work this out privately (if at all possible) the better for both sides.Best wishes to you in all of this.  I am sorry your new tenancy has been ### with such things.  I totally ### with where you stand on this.### A. ### ### Esq."43659.74375 My pleasure.  I hope everything works out well for you.  Be well.43664.6458333333 Thank you so much for your help ###!43664.6444444444 A long as you have provided the ### proving that you have used the security deposit for damage repair, you do not have to return the deposit.43646.1673611111 I have a property that was rented out. The tenant caused damages. I believe we had ### (I'm not sure the details.) I mailed out the tenant damages itemized before the ###, but to the wrong mailing address.  Remailed and tenant did not receive it until after the ###.  Due to the hurricane it was difficult to get people to come in to get quotes on the damage.  My question is do I have to return the security deposit if I mailed the itemized list before the ###.  And I have to return the security deposit, can i use the tenant still for the total damages or any excess.  Or does it have to be the same amount that we listed in our letter.  We did not charge all the damages because we didn't get quotes in time, but now we have them.  Thank you. 43644.7340277778 Sorry you are going through this.  Actually you are supposed to return any refund of security deposit within ###.  If you are unable to do so because of damage estimates, you should send the ### you have along with line items of damage you are awaiting estimates for to the Tenant within ###.  You should also send pictures of the damages.  If you partial list of damages indicated that you were still waiting for additional estimates, then yes, you can bring a Small Claims suit against the tenants after all estimates are in.  You will need the tenants' new address to serve them with the small claims suit.  I hope this information helps.43644.9236111111 Thank you so much for your response. I did not send them back their refund.  I got the itemized letter returned to me and the tenant is saying Iâ€™m over the ###.  I have proof of mailing before the ###.  Do I still return the security deposit to the tenant or can I keep it and take him to court for the remainder that is due? Or should I return the deposit and sue them for the full amount? Thanks again for your advice.43644.9847222222 ###,Sorry to hear about your situation.  You are right that the landlord shouldn't be able to apply any of your security deposit against the landlord's cost of having the house pressure washed due to ordinary wear and tear (i.e., dirt accumulating on the outside of the house over time due to nature and not because of anything you did to cause it).  As you note, this is expressly set forth in the lease (Landlord's Rules and Regulations attachment, p. 5, Section 14: Landlord will be responsible for the following: . . . exterior painting and siding . . . .")  and is also mandated under NC law (NC General Statute Section ###: "The landlord may not withhold as damages part of the security deposit for conditions that are due to normal wear and tear nor may the landlord retain an amount from the security deposit which exceeds his actual damages").Within ### (i.e. within ###/property back) the landlord is also required to mail your security deposit to you (or the amount remaining after deducting for items that can lawfully be deducted) and provide you a written itemized accounting with how any amounts not returned were applied (i.e. what legitimate damages caused by you the security deposit was used to repair and the cost to repair each of those items).  Based on the lease you attached it looks like the lease ### ended on ### and assuming you moved out and turned the keys and property back over to the landlord on that date and also provided an updated mailing address to the landlord the landlord is required to return your security deposit and/or give you an itemized written statement of how it was applied by Thursday ###.  If the landlord hasn't returned the balance to you and provided you with a written itemized accounting within the ### you have the right to sue him to require him to provide you with the itemized accounting and return the balance of the security deposit to you (and the landlord's willful failure to comply with these requirements would void his right to retain any portion of the security deposit at all).  That being said a more practical approach might be to let the landlord know (i) you are aware of your rights and what he can lawfully use the security deposit for (with pressure washing the house not being one of those things as that should only constitute normal wear and tear) and (ii) he missed the time period required to provide you with an itemized accounting of how the deposit was used (assuming he didn't provide you with one in time) and that you could take him to court for this breach and seek to have the entire deposit returned but that rather than turn this into a legal issue you'd rather he just return the $200 (again assuming that he used it to improperly pay for the pressure washing and not to repair some other type of damage to the property that he is claiming you ### responsible for).I've attached two helpful links below (one is an article generally explaining a NC tenant's rights with respect to security deposits and the other is a link to the actual NC tenant security deposit act).I hope this was helpful and wish you the best of luck. ###/###"43663.8368055556 I have a question regarding if a landlord in NC can take money from my security deposit to have a house that we rented pressure washed. The lease we signed, on page 22, states that the landlord is responsible for maintenance and repair of exterior siding and paint. I would think cleaning the house exterior would be part of that. I complied with the other parts of the ### as having the carpet professional cleaned, but nowhere did it say we have to pressure wash the house. They subtracted an even $200.###, which makes me believe they just rounded up and didn't even pay $###.

First, I am very sorry to hear of the breakup, as I know that getting used to these new changes can take time.  I hope that the summer affords you time and space to cope with the pain, and grow into an even better version of yourself as you contemplate what life has to offer you going forward.  God bless you in this.As to the legalities, your former fiance would have to be provided some notice in advance; it simply depends on how much.  The statutory provision that might be useful in your ### is N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-###4, which provides notice periods for periodic tenancies.  Thirty days' notice is required for periodic year-to-year tenancies, whereas seven days is sufficient for month-to-month tenancies, and two days for week-to-week tenancies.  If your former fiance has lived in your residence for over a year, I suggest out of an abundance of caution, that you provide hi### least ###' notice, since the small claims magistrate who would hear your case in the event that you have to sue for eviction would be far more likely to rule in your favor if you gave hi###longer notice period than seven days.  I think it possible that you could get by with just seven days, but that could ### if the magistrate does not believe that period long enough.  I will trust your discretion and judgment on that question.Notice can be written or verbal, but I strongly suggest written and signed since that will create a paper trail upon which you might rely should you have to go to court over this (keep a signed copy of whatever you send, in addition to any emails and/or texts).  Hopefully the former fiance will leave on the effective termination date, but if he does not, you will need to be prepared to sue in small claims court of su###y ejectment.  The filing fee to the Clerk of Superior Court is $###, and the service of process fee through the Sheriff is $TERM00133###.  You can also serve the former fiance by personal delivery as long as you complete an Affidavit of Service and file it with the Clerk, so that on the court date two or three weeks out, you can prove that the former fiance had proper personal service of the Complaint for Su###y Ejectment and Civil Summons.  You would check the holdover" tenant box under the four options for suing for su###y ejectment.Now as to the $######.  If you had no agreement that this had to be repaid and you are the sole owner of the property the most likely legal outcome is that your former fiance's ### in this regard will be considered either (###) an irrevocable gift to you or (###) consideration for his privilege in staying at your residence rent free.  In either case your former fiance can make a lot of noise about this and he might even try to counterclaim in an eviction lawsuit but based only on your written description of this here I do not believe he can win against you.  Just be forewarned that if for no other reason than emotion he might try to ### you in court.  Hold your ground however and be prepared to truthfully state under oath what was or was not agreed to as to the $###### should the magistrate wish for you to provide testimony under oath.  If there was however any verbal agreement of reimbursement or compensation you would be obliged to tell the truth about that as well.  If there was a verbal agreement your former fiance has up to three years to seek reimbursement in court if he is not voluntarily paid otherwise.  (Note the three-year statute of limitations in NC for loan or contractual agreements under N.C.G.S. Â§ ###-5###(###) and/or (5).I hope this is helpful in terms of providing you a roadmap of potential remedies and warnings based on North Carolina law.  I wish for you both a ### transition to better things.All the best### A. ### ### Esq."43659.7770833333 I have recently broken up with my fiance. He has been living in my home for the last year. His name is not on the deed, my address is not listed as his permanent residence, and  he does not pay any rent. I want him to move out but he refuses to leave. He is also asking for $###,###. Aside from receipts of the transactions, he does not have anything in writing about being reimbursed. I have already given him back the engagement ring along with funds he had in a savings account in my name. He is now threatening to go to court for the additional $###.My two questions are:Because he does not pay rent or have my address listed as his permanent residence, is he legally required ###?Is he legally obligated to the funds he is requesting without any documentation that he is owed them?Thank you in advance for any legal clarification you can provide.### ###43656.7076388889 Mr. ###,Thank you so much for your very informative response. I feel so much more at ease dealing with this challenging situation now knowing my legal rights. This has certainly been an interesting turn of events but I feel confident that I can handle this is in the proper, legal way. I had one more thought that I wanted to run past you after reading through everything (and if this counts as another question, that's perfectly ok). I was considering settling and offering him $###,600. If I were to do that and he still sues for the remaining $###,###, do you believe the magistrate would rule in his side in that case? Since I gave him a portion of the money, would that suggest that I felt he was owed something to begin with? I thought about putting in writing that I am attempting to settle at $###?Again, I cannot thank you enough for your wisdom and kind words. I look forward to your response. Have a wonderful week### ###43661.5020833333 Ms. ###:You are very welcome.  Very good follow-up question.  Here's how I would handle it: if he receives a partial payment as a ### gesture from you, you both should sign an agreement that states that this is a compromise and is ###t to be a good faith settlement of the issue of the $###.  In exchange for the payment, the former fiance should agree to release you of any liability or ### claims in the future.  If he agrees to such a ### and signs a document that says that, you would forever be discharged fro###y potential liability in a civil case.  But remember that the agreement must make absolutely clear that this was a ### ###, he could still pursue you without the magic language.I would try to address both the sums paid and the eviction issue in the same document, and you both sign it, if at all possible.  A lawyer can draft a brief memorandum with all the right language included for a relatively small fee.

Iâ€™ve been having a moldy smell in my apartment shorty after the maintenance man started coming over to paint things in my apartment I believe he was painting over mold 43656.7847222222 Ms. Weeks,Under NC law, the landlord is required to have the apartment in a good and fit condition when you first move in and to maintain the apartment so that it stays that way. I advise you to notify your landlord that you are continuing to have problems with mold. If you have not already done so, please be sure to document your reports in writing. If possible send an email, so that you can have record of what you discussed, when, to whom the report was sent, and the response. If possible, also take pictures.  If your landlord indicates he/she will make repairs, be sure to follow up until they are made. If you do not receive a response you may want to consider contacting a county or city agency such as code enforcement or the Department of Public Health to request an inspection. Your landlord cannot evict you for contacting the a government office to report the problem. It is also important to understand that you must continue to pay your rent on time, keep your apartment in good repair, and to continue to give your landlord notice of this issue and others. The landlord can still evict you for violating your lease or for failure to pay rent on time, even though there is a mold problem that they have not resolved.If your landlord fails to make the repairs after your attempt to work with him/her, you may file a suit. However, it will be important to have the documentation noted above. I hope this answers your questions and gives you a place to start.43691.0666666667 Hi, My HOA put a lien on my home last year. Their attorney office offered me a payment plan, but the HOA board waited ###. I was told I could not make payments until the board responded to their request. When the board finally responded, they gave me a few months to pay. After I sent what was to be the last payment, the HOA attorney office contacted me back telling me that an additional $###. An amount no one mentioned until after i sent the last payment. I was told $###, $###. With special assessments, my community has a year to pay them added onto monthly dues. The payments on the new special assessments will start next month for everyone else. When I asked if I could also pay added onto regular dues, my board got mad and had their attorney tell me that if I do not pay the additional $###, they would foreclose. I asked for longer to pay because the amount they want is substantial. I was told no. I feel I am being treated unfairly. Every other homeowner in the past has been given payment plans through their attorney office. And every other homeowner is allowed to pay the new special assessments over a period of one year. (From ### ###20) I was also sent a ledger from the HOA's attorney. I have paid them $###. None of my payments are showing up on the ledger for my account. I am very concerned and do not know what to do. This is my home. They know I am on a fixed income. I do not understand why no one gave me a revised total until after I sent what was supposed to be the last payment. Every time I have tried asking their attorney office, I am shot down. I was even accused of not sending the payment.I am disabled and do not know where to turn. Where can I find an attorney who accepts payments or does pro bono work? Based on how this has come about, is this even legal for them to demand more money on top of everything I paid? Please help. I have no idea where to turn. Thank you, ### ###43661.3097222222 Dear ###,I'm sorry to hear about your situation. Landlords and other consumer creditors (for example, credit card companies) will sometimes hire debt collection agencies to try to collect debts that they claim they are owed or will sometimes even sell the alleged debt to a debt buyer where the debt buyer then owns the debt and likewise attempts to collect it (based on the above it sounds like you are saying that a debt buyer has purchased the alleged debt from your landlord and is now trying to collect it).  NC law makes it unlawful for a debt collection agency or a debt buyer to attempt to collect a debt without (i) valid documentation that the debt buyer is the owner of the specific debt account at issue and (ii) reasonable verification of the amount of the debt allegedly owed by the debtor.  Reasonable verification includes giving you documentation of the name of the original creditor (i.e., your landlord), the name and address of the alleged debtor (i.e., you) as appearing on the original creditor's records (i.e., the forwarding address you provided your landlord at check out), a copy of the contract or other document evidencing the consumer debt (i.e., your lease, namely the provisions in your lease that would make you liable for damages you allegedly caused to the rental property) and an itemized accounting of the amount claimed to be owed, including all fees and charges (i.e., a statement ### out the repairs that the landlord made and the cost of each in connection with the damages you are alleged to have made to the property).  Additionally, it is unlawful for a debt collection agency or debt buyer to bring a lawsuit against an alleged debtor to collect on an alleged debt without first giving the debtor written notice of the intent to file a legal action at least ### - the written notice has to include all of the foregoing information (i.e., name, address and telephone number of debt buyer, name of original creditor, copy of the contract or other document evidencing the consumer debt and an itemized accounting of all amounts claimed to be owed) as well.Another thing to note is that if you had a security deposit with your landlord, under NC law, within ###/you moved out and returned possession of the rental to the landlord, your landlord was required to return your security deposit to you or provide you with an itemized accounting of what damages there were to the property that the security deposit was used to repair (if your landlord's claims against the security deposit weren't finalized within ###'ve had to send you an interim accounting within ### ###).  If you had a security deposit and the landlord didn't follow the above requirements, you could have a legal claim against the landlord for the return of the entire security deposit (and the landlord could be further subject to penalties and other punitive damages if he acted in bad faith).If you feel that the debt ### collection agency or your landlord is in violation of the requirements set forth above you may want to try to find a lawyer to assist you and further explain your ###.  You can try contacting Legal Aid of North Carolina to see if they might be able to assist you  - they offer free legal services to qualifying individuals and their website can be found at http://www.legalaidnc.org/.  They might also be able to recommend a lawyer in your area who could help.I hope the above was helpful and wish you the best of luck.Thank you.43675.8569444444 To who it may concern,Me and two friends rented an apartment for three years. We just ended the lease in ###19. On the move out we signed the exit paperwork and provided the lessor with a forwarding address and contact information for any charges after our lease.Almost two months later, we were contacted by a debt collector for damages to set property for $5,000. For more than thirty days we have not been formally contacted or received a ### for these damages by the lessor. Is it legal for them to sell our debt without even attempting to contact us? We still have not been given a breakdown of what these damages were.43662.7611111111  I would like to separate from my husband and he will not cooperate. We currently live in a rental home(myself, husband, ###) to which he is not on the lease, pays no bills, never paid rent and no bills in his name for the past ###. I can afford the rent and bills on my own but I would not be able to if I moved elsewhere. He is not working so I would receive no child-support from him to help with increased rent. Can anything be done to help?43663.9208333333 Hey ###,I highly recommend starting separation proceedings immediately if you are certain of this decision and you are providing the financial and family support. I also recommend reviewing your lease to be certain. If you are the sole leaseholder, technically you do have a right to kick him out of the home. However, I do not believe it is likely a sheriff would enforce this unless you properly evict him (or this is a domestic dispute). Eviction requires a fee and filling out a few court documents. The best scenario would involve him moving out and then separation proceedings beginning. Good luck,###43698.6819444444 Hi ###,Do you think you could review my lease and see if there is anything that would prevent me from evicting him? Turns out I put him on as a tenant, of course. Also, how do I go forward with the separation, legally, if he will not cooperate? Thank you for all your help. Itâ€™s been invaluable to me. ### 43708.7243055556 Ok great. I was not aware that I can file eviction papers alone, I thought the landlord had to. Thank you so much for your help ###!43699.9555555556 Sure thing ###. Again check your lease (eviction section, etc.), but as the lease holder, you are able to evict ### in certain situations.  43700.5743055556 Upon a cursory review of the lease, ### (and I assume your children) are merely occupants. You are the tenant and leaseholder, therefore you have the authority to evict ### as an occupant. Keep in mind the multitude of factors as you more forward with ### fact that he has marriage rights, rights to the children, could assert financial rights (although you stated he has not been making any payments), etc. Also, keep in mind that the landlord has the ultimate say over you as the leaseholder and the occupants if they feel they need to get involved. The separation only requires you both to physically separate (with a few factors to be proven once the divorce is actually filed ###). However, some divorces involve attorneys and they typically draft separation agreements to be signed by the husband/wife. Something to think about if you are concerned about potential issues arising. I have attached a resource guide. See page 11. It will reference the laws and lay it out plainly. Glad to help ###. 43712.5520833333 Hi there, I am sorry that this has happened to you.  In North Carolina, a landlord is required to maintain the deposit in a very specific way and also may only use the deposit for very specific purposes.  Here is the law.

Also, a landlord cannot use the deposit for â€œnormal wear and tear.â€  I think you can argue that a spot on the carpet is normal wear and tear and the landlord cannot deduct the cleaning cost from the security deposit.

If he has refused, you are left with either government enforcement of noise regulation or a civil suit.Find out what local government regulates your area  -- a city or a county.  Then call to ask if there is a noise ordinance.  It is common for communities to regulate loud noise from the evening to early morning.  Find out exactly what entity regulates your neighborhood and ask for a copy of the regulation.  You should be able to determine if this noise is too early in the morning and too loud.  If it is, you can file a complaint and have the city or county deal with the problem.If there is no regulation where you are, this would require you to bring a civil suit claiming he is creating a noise nuisance.  As you can imagine that would be expensive, slow and not very effective.  You would need a lawyer to make this claim and even then, there is no guarantee that you could get a court order to have him stop.43675.61875 My new neighbors SUV is so loud that it ### me every time he goes to work at 5:30am.

North Carolina has a Tenant Security Deposit Act that addresses how a tenant security deposit needs to be dealt with, how it can be applied and the proper procedures in connection with the same.  The full Act can be found here: ###The specific portion of the Act that you highlighted in your question (and that it sounds like was partially written into your lease) is Section ### (Landlord's Obligations).  That section essentially provides that within ###/the tenant moves out and returns possession of the rental to the landlord, the landlord is required to return the security deposit to the tenant or provide the tenant with an itemized accounting of what damages there were to the property that the security deposit was used to repair (if the landlord's claims against the security deposit aren't finalized within ### ### ###).  That section also provides that the landlord can't withhold damages from the security deposit that are due to normal wear and tear (see Section 42-###).Section ### (Remedies) of the Act lists the remedies available to a tenant if a landlord doesn't comply with the requirements of the Act.  The first sentence of that section provides that if the landlord fails to account for and refund the balance of the security deposit as required, the tenant can institute a civil action to require the accounting of and recovery of the balance of the deposit.  Based on your question, it sounds like your landlord sent you the accounting but that it was ### (received within ### ###), and the landlord, based on the accounting, is claiming that the damages to the premises were more than the amount of the deposit and therefore the landlord has applied the entire balance to repair the alleged damages and is claiming that you owe an additional amount for excess damages that weren't covered by the deposit.  Accordingly, you don't really have any remedies under the first sentence of Section ### already received the accounting and been told that there is no balance to return because the entire deposit was applied to cover the alleged damages.  The second sentence of the remedies section provides that the willful failure of the landlord to comply with, among other things, the deposit and notice requirements shall void the landlord's right to retain any portion of the security deposit.  Given that the landlord ultimately provided you with the accounting (i.e., the landlord is now in compliance with that portion of the Act by having provided you with the accounting, it was just ###), it will probably be difficult to show that simply providing the accounting ### (although you could certainly try to make that argument to a court, I just do not think there is much, if any, chance it would be successful).All that being said, if you think that the damages are excessive, inaccurate or were reported as being damaged prior to moving in (i.e., you didn't cause them) or even just the result of ordinary wear and tear you can certainly bring an action in small claims court against your landlord and ask the small claims court to find the amount of damages you should actually owe, or if you feel that you shouldn't be liable for any amount of damages and should in fact be entitled to the return of some or all of your security deposit you can ask the court to enter a judgment in your favor for the landlord to return that amount to you.An action can be brought in small claims court when the amount of damages you are claiming is less than $10,000.  You can bring the action against your landlord in any county where your landlord (assuming your landlord is a business i.e., corporation) does business (i.e., the county where your old apartment was located).  A lawsuit in small claims court is an informal trial in front of a magistrate and doesn't require you to have a lawyer (you can just represent yourself if you want).To start the lawsuit you will need to complete several forms and file them with the clerk of court in any county where your landlord (again assuming your landlord is a business i.e., corporation) does business (i.e., the county where your old apartment was located) - namely a complaint and a magistrate summons.  The cost to file the complaint is $96.  It then costs an additional $###.  Your landlord has to be served in order for your case to proceed to trial.  If the magistrate ends up ruling in your favor at the small claims trial (i.e., they find that the damages are not accurate, you shouldn't be liable for all or some of them or that you are entitled to some or all of your security deposit back) then the magistrate can also add the $### $###.  If you cannot afford to pay the $### $###, you can fill out a form Petition to ### Motions as Indigent" and a form "Civil Affidavit of Indigency" and submit them to the clerk to see if they will waive those fees (if you receive food ### Temporary Assistance to Needy ### or Supplemental ### the clerk may automatically allow you to bring the lawsuit without paying any fees - if you don't receive any of these benefits then you will have to complete the two indigent forms).  All of these forms can be found online at ### or you should be able to get them from the clerk's office (the clerk might be willing to help assist you with completing the forms and the clerk will need to complete a portion of the magistrate summons form).At the small claims trial you will need to prove why/how the damages are excessive inaccurate or were already there when you moved in (i.e. you didn't cause them) or that they were just caused by ordinary wear and tear.  You should get together any materials that will help you prove your side of the story including your move in and move out sheets (if you have these) that show that certain of those items were already damaged prior to you moving in and that you didn't damage them or otherwise make them worse and any photos (if you took any ideally with date stamps) that show the condition before you moved in and when you moved out - anything that will help show that the damages the landlord is claiming are excessive inaccurate were already there when you moved in or were the result of ordinary wear and tear.  You can also ask anyone who has first hand knowledge of the case to come to trial with you to be a witness and testify as to the condition of the apartment before you moved in and at the time you moved out - they will have to tell the magistrate themselves about what they saw or know.I am also attaching a guide to small claims court published by Legal Aid of North Carolina.  You should definitely read the entire guide - it goes into more detail regarding the small claims court process the necessary forms and the costs and also provides a bunch of other helpful information.Lastly if you do decide to proceed with a small claims action before doing so you might want to consider first ### to your old landlord directly and see if you can't reach an agreement without the need for a small claims ###.  You could explain why you think the damages are excessive inaccurate were already there when you moved in or resulted from ordinary wear and tear and see if you can't reach an agreement to have these reduced (or if you think you shouldn't be responsible for any of these removed and all or a portion of your security deposit otherwise returned).  If you are able to reach an agreement that works for you with your landlord you will want to have it put in writing and make sure that you both sign it.I hope this is helpful and wish you the best of luck."43682.8479166667 I moved out of my home on ###st of this year and my landlord didn't send back my security deposit. On ###th I received a letter about damages that were in excess of the security deposit. Most of which are excessive, inaccurate or were reported as damaged prior to moving in. I was wondering how you believe I should best proceed in this situation? The letter states that they'll send me to collections if I don't pay it within ###. I read that if the landlord doesn't provide an itemized list of damage within ### 60, I am entitled to my full security deposit. The landlord didn't do this and sent me the letter ###. Was wondering if you could confirm this? Also if I do receive calls from collection agencies how do I respond? The following was stated in my lease:After having deducted the above amounts the Landlord by and through its Agent shall if the Tenantâ€™s address is known to him refund to the Tenant within thirty (30) days after the termination of the tenancy and delivery of possession the balance of the ### Security Deposit along with an itemized statement of any deductions. If the extent of the Landlordâ€™s claim against the security deposit cannot be ### within ### Landlordâ€™s Agent shall provide Tenant with an interim accounting no later than ### ###."Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thank you### ###"43677.8729166667 Do not take legal advice from your adversary!  You should definitely get a good lawyer if you decide to divorce. Your husband might make a claim to a share of the equity in the house based on the expenditure of marital assets to improve your separate property, but he does not have a clear right to one half of this property.  If he does nothing and you get divorced, this risk is gone, if one of you files for divorce, he must make a claim for Equitable Distribution and ask for a share of this property.  If he does that you should definitely get a lawyer to represent you.  It will be worth a lot more than the funds at risk.43679.5826388889 I own my house and land out right. It is in my name only. In fact, it is in my name with my previous husbands last name, who passed away. Iâ€™ve gotten remarried and am considering a divorce, my current husband says we would have to sell the house and split it all down the middle. Is the true for North Carolina law? His name is not on the property. He has invested about $50,###. However after improvements the new value of our home is around $###. Will I have to sell the house and split it all down the middle with him? 43678.9069444444 Hi there, I am sorry that you are dealing with this difficult situation.  Unfortunately, a hotel rental is a night to night rental and a hotel may change the rental rate at will UNLESS it has a written contract with you stating otherwise.  If the hotel signed an agreement or contract with you stating that you would pay a specific rental rate, then you may have a case. Otherwise, rates are subject to change and the hotel is not required to provide any type of written notice to tenants in the absence of any agreement regarding the rates.Finally, I will say that this seems to be to be a very high monthly rental rate.  I would encourage you to look elsewhere for housing as you may be able to find something more affordable.  Additionally, you may apply for public housing through HUD in your local community.  Although there are often long wait lists, it still may be good to get on the list.  I hope that this information is helpful to you, and I wish you the best.43704.6958333333 Myself my daughter and boyfriend are currently living in an efficiency hotel paying $###. my boyfriend lost his job and instead of paying weekly we were offered nightly rate of $55.###. we understood after ###. recently we went to pay our nightly rate as usual and we were informed that the owner decided to go up on nightly rates to encourage tenants to weekly paying.  we were not notified about this at all prior to and after paying the new nightly rate of $62.### $###. the rate went up ### ### (roaches and other insects) in the rooms. i have all receipts of what i was paying and how the rate one day out of nowhere.  the rate change was not posted in the office and me or any of the other tenents were given a written notice of the change. is there anything i can do? 43679.7263888889 Current mortgage company filed for foreclosure although monthly payments were being made.  There was a payment dispute in ###19.  I began making payments through money gram in ###.  I wasn't aware of that until ### after speaking to a rep, I then received a letter stating they payments were insufficient that's why they weren't processed.  The whole time my payments remained in money gram without any notification to me.  Now I'm being charged court fees and other fees which total about $###. I can't afford to pay these fees especially when I'm not at fault I can only afford the mortgage payments. Please advise.43683.59375 I have the full balance I'm just unable to pay the $###.  So what should I do in this case because that's the issue?43692.83125 If you are totally unable to pay the arrearage to bring the loan current, your only other option is to contact the lender and try to find someone who will negotiate with you on a plan to bring the loan current.  Be prepared to offer a substantial portion of that arrearage every month along with keeping the regular payments current.If that does not work, you could go to the foreclosure hearing and defend yourself by saying they failed to return the rejected payments to you.  You will need to be able to offer a substantial reinstatement for the lender or the Court to listen to you.43683.6236111111 You should try calling the lender to see if you can find someone authorized to negotiate a settlement with you. If you are able to bring it current except for that $###, it is likely that they would prefer to have the money to completing the foreclosure.  It never hurts to ask, beg and try to get a better deal.43692.8631944444 My boyfriend and  purchased a car together but because I had just got my license ### we thought it be cheaper to have it in his name. Since then I have been driving the car to and from work and letting him use it on weekends when he is off but ### he wanted to prove a point he called the police because I wouldn't let him take the car and then because it's in his name there was nothing i could do, so my hope is for someone to help me write up a contract to be notarized to prevent this from happening in the future.43682.7236111111 Ok thank you 43683.9173611111 The first question is would he sign that agreement?  It is not likely. But if so, you would have him agreeing to transfer half once it is paid for and you have the title.  How would you enforce that if he fails to follow through? Can you afford to go to Court?  the police are not very likely to be any more respectful of such an agreement than they were with your claims last week.More importantly, an agreement between the two of you does not bind any third parties -- like the loan company.  If you put money into this car, consider it rent.  It is highly unlikely that your boyfriend will ever put your name on the title.  You have seen how he behaves only a month into your deal.  People don't change.43683.5423611111 This problem will only get worse with time.  You need to get your name or his name totally off right away.  If he is going to call the police because you disagree on using the car, putting both names on the title will only make it ###.  If you paid for the car, you are not likely to get all your money back.  It is likely that he will make you pay him for the car to release his interest.  Better to walk away before you lose any more money.There is nothing we can write that will solve this problem.  You need the car solely in your name -- he needs to sign over the title.  It is highly unlikely that he will do that.  Ask him to give it to you; if he refuses, you need to walk away from this problem as soon as you can.43682.7895833333 Unfortunately the car is financed so the loan is in his  name but what if I write up a contact saying that me and him agree that although the car is in his name the two of us agree that the car will belong to both of us and that we agree to pay for the car together.43683.5034722222 Hello ###,If you are planning on financing the purchase of the property that has a judgment lien on record against it with a bank (i.e., you are borrowing money to buy the property and then giving the bank you borrow the money from a mortgage), no bank will agree to lend you money unless the judgement lien against the seller on the property is released (otherwise your bank lender would be junior to that judgment lien - essentially the judgment lien creditor could foreclose on the property, sell it and wipe out" your bank lender's mortgage so that your bank lender's only recourse would be against you and your husband individually and your bank lender wouldn't be able to realize on any of the value of the property unless there were sale proceeds left over after satisfying the foreclosing judgment lien creditor's debt).  Again the key take away here is that it is highly unlikely that any bank lender would agree to lend you money to buy the property in this situation unless the judgment lien is released.Even if you are not planning on financing the purchase of the property with a bank and instead will be paying with cash that you have you won't be able to get a clean title policy from a title company (something that ### of property typically ###) unless the judgment lien is released.  Before issuing a title policy the title company will search for any other liens on record against the property and inform you of them so that you can ensure that they are taken care ### before agreeing to buy the property.  In this situation I think having title run is highly advisable.  If the seller has one judgment lien on record against the property that you are aware of without proper title work there is no telling what other liens might be on record against the property (i.e. mortgages other judgment liens tax liens etc.) all of which if not released before you close you would take ownership of the property subject to (i.e. those lien creditors if not paid in full or otherwise satisfied could sell the property out from under ###).Setting aside the fact that there could be other liens on record against the property (that you wouldn't know about without proper title work) I suppose you could try to negotiate directly with the judgment lien creditor to release their lien for an agreed upon amount.  However they might ### payment in full since they know someone is interested in buying the property and they would have leverage in that situation (i.e. they wouldn't want to agree to release their lien without payment in full and thereby allow the seller who owes them money to receive proceeds from the sale before they get paid off).Long story short I would not buy the property unless (###) you have proper title work done (which shows no other liens or mortgages on record other than the judgment lien you are aware of) and (###) the judgment lien you are aware of is released (payment to release that lien could either come from a portion of the sale proceeds at closing (you'll want to ensure the judgment lien creditor and an ### agent are involved in that situation to ensure the lien release is recorded in conjunction with you taking title and that the judgment lien creditor actually receives the payment amount) or from the seller with his own money prior to closing).I hope this was helpful.Thank you."43685.0534722222 Hello,My husband and I are talking with someone about purchasing their property, and we came to find out that there is a judgement lien attached to the property due to an unpaid mortgage on a different property owned by this person. We have negotiated a very good deal for this house, well below tax value, however we do not want to have the property transferred to us with the lien attached. We understand that the seller could contact his creditor to come to a settlement, but he doesn't seem willing to do this. Is there a way that we as the buyers could get the lien released if we came to a settlement with the creditor? We don't mind paying a little bit to do this since we are getting the house for so cheap. Thank, look forward to hearing your response. 43682.8256944444 Hello my name is ### ### I currently have a restraining order on my ex-husband ### ### will the judge in that case awarded a vehicle to me because I made the payments even though the vehicle was in his and my name there's a lien on this vehicle well I was in an accident on Friday not my fault but they totaled my vehicle I still owe money on this vehicle but the insurance company because he and I both are on this title need his in my signature for the check to send to the lien company I do not know where he is the last I heard he was in a homeless shelter in ### North Carolina I cannot have any contact with him this man abused me he has broken bones in my body and he has threatened my life many many times I have done everything I can to get away from him change my number move everything I can't go around him to get a signature is there anything I can do with my protection order and a judge's signature signing the car to me? Thank you, ### 43683.6986111111 Hi there ###, I am sorry to hear about your car accident and about what you have gone through with your ex-husband.  I am happy that you are away from him and safe now.  As to your car question, unfortunately, the judge in the domestic violence case cannot assist you with this.  In order to divide property between spouses, you have to file a case in domestic court and ask a judge to deal with it there, separate from a domestic violence case.  This type of case is called equitable distribution.  Unfortunately, if the two of you are already divorced, you may not be able to file for equitable distribution now.  Have you told the insurance company that there is a domestic violence order in place and that your husband is not allowed to contact you?  If so, how have they responded?  I would demand to speak with someone in their general counselâ€™s office about this.  There has got to be something that can be done under the circumstances to move this situation forward and pay the lien company - ask the insurance company to send the check directly to the lien company.  I am sorry that I cannot provide more help, but I hope that this information is at least helpful to you.  I wish you the best.43704.6916666667 ###:If you haven't done so you should report the car as stolen to the police and to the owner.  If you were taking the car for a test drive then you aren't criminally responsible for it being stolen.  You should report it to the police right away. Its possible that the police towed it.  If it was stolen then the longer you wait to report it the more likely it is that the owner can try to hold you responsible in civil court for negligently leaving the vehicle unattended.43735.6840277778 I am a mechanic and I took car for test drive it broke down walked home left car on side of rd went back ### . can i get in trouble what should I do43685.5270833333 There are several factors at play here, so I will answer your question based on a few â€œif this, then thatâ€ contingencies:First, if the ### has been using the land for more than ###, you have a potential problem with adverse possession.  I am going to assume your notation of a â€œfewâ€ years means less than 20.Based on that assumption, the certified letters may be causing you more of a problem than they are solving.  There is no requirement that the letters be mailed certified, and the ### may simply be failing to claim the certified mail.  I would recommend sending the notice you describe by Federal Express - that will allow you to track delivery without requiring the recipient/### to actually have to sign for the package.Once you have delivered that notice, you have actually done all you need to do from a legal perspective to put the ### on notice that he needs to vacate the land by ###st.

If so, could you see if you can submit it so that I can take a look at it?I assume you have been paying rent?  Eviction of a camper from a campground is not covered by landlord/tenant laws in NC, and as such you don't have the rights that a typical tenant would have.  ### are covered by the Membership Camping Act" which is attached here.  However without seeing your agreement with the owner I'm not sure whether this statute applies in your case.Typically the owner can ask you to leave at any time.  In order to recoup any money that you've already paid you'd need to take the owner to small claims court.-###"43726.8486111111 Hello, Ms. ###.  The first thing I would recommend you do is to put your homeowners insurance carrier on notice of a potential injury claim by the roofer.  This protects you from the insurance company later saying that you did not timely notify them of a potential claim.  You should do that in writing - email is fine - so that you have a written record of having reported the potential claim.  Reporting the potential claim will not cause your premiums to increase, but it will protect you if the roofer ever tries to pursue a personal injury or workers comp claim against you.Having said that, I am going to assume the roofer has not asked you for money at this point.  It sounds like perhaps he is just trying to intimidate you into not pursuing a claim against him for the warranty.  You do have a right to take him to small claims court for damages based upon (###) poor workmanship; and (###) also under the warranty, assuming he did give you a written warranty.  The evidence you would need to prove your case in small claims court is a receipt of payment to a qualified roofer who fixed the leaks.  In other words, I would recommend you hire a qualified contractor to come look at the roof, assess what needs to be done to repair the leaks and correct any other deficiencies they may see with the first ### work.  Then, you should send a letter to the first roofer demanding he pay you the cost to fix his shoddy work.  If he fails to pay, you can go to the courthouse and file a small claims action against him to recover the amount you had to pay for the repairs + any filing fees you had to pay to the court.  You may qualify for a waiver of the filing fee depending on your income.  I have attached a link to a helpful guide to filing an action in small claims court in North Carolina:  ###.If you do not have the money to hire a new contractor to fix the issues, you can get estimates, take the first roofer to court and ask the magistrate to award you a judgment for the amount of the estimate.  I just donâ€™t know how long you can wait to get the roof leaks repaired.  I hope this is helpful and good luck!43704.7055555556 I hired a roofer he says he was licensed , since his work have not confirmed that. Hired a roofer ###,###.

I didnâ€™t say anything an since now my living room is leaking he promised to come out to fix an since Has not answered my calls or text an has posted on Facebook he is in pain.

Also isnâ€™t the agent suppose to be present in this inspection  43700.8361111111 Whether the landlord can evict you for any of this depends on the terms of your written lease agreement.  Most residential lease agreements prohibit people form operating a business out of their property, so if you are operating as a caregiver then that may be a reason to break the lease.  I don't have a copy of the agreement so I can't say for sure whether there is any violation.  The good news is that rental company cannot evict you without a hearing in front of a magistrate.  If you feel that you have not violated the ### you should definitely be prepared to go to the magistrate and defend yourself.  You should be prepared with a copy of the lease and application that shows who is renting the property and that the ramp is approved.  In the meantime you should continue to pay your rent if you want to stay there.  Hopefully the magistrate agrees with you that the lease has not been violated and you can stay on the property.43735.7138888889 Hello, My landlord is evicting us due to my previous question, when we moved in there was a contract made that I repair the home so it would be livable and she would reimburse us. She only paid part of the moneys owed. She is saying we still owe rent , and a pet deposit I also have a signed statement that she would waive the pet deposit fees.

The law firm likely represents the trustee in this scenario (which is a neutral third party). The house if yours until a foreclosure order is actually signed. That requires a court hearing and signed order. You may go forward with selling the house, however, there is probably a ### that requires you to disclose it is in ### title search should reveal this. Typically, homeowners sign an agreement with a lender / loan holder to payoff the foreclosure amount through the sale of the house. Otherwise, the house is secured against the loan and the buyer can also sue you for damages. You may also payoff the amount beforehand to stop the foreclosure. You may also negotiate with the loan holder to bring down the reinstatement amount. It seems this is a legitimate claim? Also, that a payment may never have been made if the original amount was so much less. The first step should be asking to enter into loss mitigation (that might be what signing that contract would mean). That delays the foreclosure and puts everything on hold. You may also seek a continuance at your first hearing, which is typically granted. Good luck,###43720.5298611111 My husband and I was recently served with Notice of Hearing on Foreclosure of Deed of Trust.The Notice was filed by a local law firm, representing a third party.  We are in the process of selling the home, closing prior to the court date.  How will the this affect the closing of the house and the proceeds, do we need to let our realtor know we were served?  We had no idea this third party (Partners for Payment Relief DE IV LLC) had a Deed of Trust on our property.  When we called the local law firm, they referred us to another agency SN Serving Corporation in ###, CA. who stated they were collecting on behalf of Partners for Payment Relief.

You need a lawyer to draft a deed to move the property from your name into the trust.  First make sure that the attorney reads the trust and advises you about whether it does what you expect it to do.  Then, consider what else you have put into the Trust -- bank accounts, investments, and so forth.  Remember that a will controls probate, does not avoid it.  So, leaving things to pass under your will to the trust does not help avoid probate.43720.5631944444 Property has no lien.

First the City of ###ia probably cant be held liable for the work of the contractors unless they hired the contractors and were in charge of supervising their work. I doubt that was the case here.  Your best bet is to continue pressing the contractors to come out and do their job. There are recognized implied warranties for this type of construction work.  If push comes to shove and they cannot satisfactorily repair the property then you would have to either file a lawsuit against the construction company on your own, or hire a lawyer to help you.  The lawsuit would have to be filed in ### County General District Court since the damages you are claiming are under $###.  This is not small claims court, but it is a little easier to navigate than superior court.  If you decide to hire a lawyer then you can try ### to find one in your area.  Whatever you do, you should be prepared with as much evidence as possible, including before and after pictures of the work, copies of contracts and e-mails to and form the workers, and any witnesses that you can gather to help describe the work that was done.43735.7083333333 My house was recently ### by a grant given by the City of ### and the work was completed by ### Contractors and was done poorly.

How do i sue the city and can receive a fair hearing despite of sufficient funds to hire a lawyer? Also, the write up for this job is $22,###. I am being bullied out of this situation and need legal advice.43720.8694444444 Mr. ###:Thank you for your question; I hope you, your fiancee and her mother are healthy and well.  I think this is essentially a contract question, and as a contracts lawyer who sometimes handles landlord-tenant matters, I would say that if your current lease agreement specifically states that you can have indoor pets, your right to retain them lasts until one of the following occurs: (###) your lease naturally expires, and a new no pets" policy becomes a requirement for a lease renewal; or (###) your landlord in exchange for some benefit flowing to you in return signs with the tenants a "no pets" addendum to your present lease that imposes new requirements for the present lease period despite a lease having already been signed.  So to begin your first step in your analysis should always begin with your lease agreement (if you have one in writing) whereby you consult any provision therein that specifically governs the tenants' rights to indoor pets.Changes in the analysis may differ depending on whether you do or do not have a written lease that specifically mentions the issue of pets.  If there is no written lease the landlord has more wiggle room so to speak to impose new regulations mid-lease (and this can sometimes be true even when there is a written lease if there is a ### clause that allows the landlord to promulgate new rules and regulations relating to safety health and related concerns on the premises).If there is a written lease and that written lease says absolutely nothing about pets I think a very strong argument could be made on your side that by allowing your family to have had pets indoors for the past ### the landlord has in effect ### the conduct by practice even if the contract does not specifically state the landlord's position one way or the other.  This would allow you the flexibility to retain your pets at least until your current lease period is over and if the landlord wants to impose this new requirement as a condition for being accepted for a renewal the landlord would be legally entitled to do so even over your objections.What I have tried to do here is briefly outline the different outcomes in which this situation might go depending on facts that I do not specifically know.  Eventually the landlord will prevail on this issue if the landlord really really wants this to be the new rule; it is just a question of whether that requirement would become legally effective now or if it would be delayed until your current lease period is over.If you believe after reflecting on this answer (and consulting your lease agreement if you have one in writing) that you have the upper hand for now I would recommend having a lawyer send your landlord a brief letter advising as to the legalities of requiring no pets in the middle of a presently existing lease with tenants who have had pets in their rented home for almost a quarter century.  Most local general practitioners would be sufficiently familiar with these issues that they would be qualified to help you and otherwise you could search for a local lawyer with a focus on real property and landlord-tenant law.  Most lawyers in this area would be willing to send an advisory letter to your landlord for a small amount of money.  If cost is still a prohibitive factor I would look up your local Legal Aid of North Carolina office and see if they can help you at no cost to you.  Once they know more about the specifics of your present lease situation they can likely provide you more precise guidance than I can based on limited information.God bless you and your family this fall in ### County.

If your deed to this property lists you and your spouse as the grantees, and does not specify any other relationship besides that of tenants by the entirety (such as tenants in common" or "joint tenants with rights of survivorship") a creditor cannot proceed against the house if the $8###; property owned by a married couple (tenants by the entirety) can be levied against only if both spouses are on the debt.  If both spouses are on the debt then yes your real property is potentially vulnerable.If the property is not jointly held (or is not held as tenants by the entirety) you should ask an experienced real estate lawyer whether you can without ### of liability for a fraudulent conveyance deed the property to you and your wife jointly and equally as tenants by the entirety.  If so that will protect your property from your creditors if you are on the only person on the debt.In the event that you are sued and you have a judgment entered against you by a judge you will be served a "Notice to Claim Exempt Property" by the party that won the judgment and you will have ### (assuming your home is at risk) and in your tangible personal property.

I just really need to know where I ### what can be done to me or what I can do in recourse to her actions. 43726.7111111111 Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  If your landlord refuses to soon fix this defect, she is in breach of the implied warranty of habitability, codified at N.C.G.S. Â§ ###2-###2.  A water pump specifically falls under Â§ ###2-###2(a)(2) and (###), as well as Â§ ###2-###2(a)(8).  Once a landlord has actual knowledge" of a habitability defect such as the one in play here s/he has a "reasonable time" to make adequate repairs.  The fact that the landlord cannot afford the repairs is not a sufficient legal excuse to avoid fulfilling a landlord's statutory obligations under North Carolina law.  Either the landlord must release you from rental obligations on terms that include monetary concessions to you for your hardship in this situation or you can sue the landlord for the remedy of "rent abatement" in small claims court.  In addition to being asked to be released fro###y further obligations to the landlord (including but not limited to paying rent) you can also ask for rent abatement which is calculated as diminished fair rental value for the period of time in which the habitability defect went unaddressed after a reasonable time following the landlord's actual notice of the problem.  The small claims magistrate has broad discretion in deciding what a fair rent abatement would be based on the specifics of your situation.The forms for small claims actions are available at the courthouse in the Clerk of Superior Court's office.  You might contact the closest office of Legal Aid of NC to see if they are able to represent you at no cost to yourself.  Otherwise you might have to do this on your own if you cannot find a local lawyer willing to do this on a free pro bono basis.God bless you in this situation in your pregnancy and imminent delivery and your life in general as you transition this fall.### A. ### ### Esq."43726.75625 It will probably be worth your while to consult with a lawyer to make this closing go smoothly.  You could send him a formal eviction notice to be out the first of November, and then file an action in small claims court, but this is not assured of going smoothly if he is resisting and refusing to cooperate. He could cause a delay that would affect your closing. Assuming he does not have a written lease, he is a month to month tenant and you have the right to terminate his tenancy.  However, enforcing that takes court and sheriff action.The only way to enforce the terms of your divorce is to get an attorney to help you and your case would be in district court where you need the help of a lawyer.43731.5534722222 So my ex and I divorced in ###, the house is solely in my name.  I agreed to let him live there as long as he paid the mortgage.  He told me ###.  I got an estimate and got a cash offer and signed the contract to sell.  Closing is ###.  I sent him a certified copy of the sales contract.  Per divorce papers upon sale of the house we split proceeds 50/50.  He is refusing to believe the house is sold and I need to know how can I get him out of the house legally?  43730.7930555556 Excellent, Ms. ###.  I am glad that you never withheld rent, as that will prove useful to you in your litigation offensive game against the defendant(s), thereby removing the counterclaim most likely to arise in such a suit as the one you could likely bring.Here is the general rule about leases through successive property managers: once the old management co###y is out of the picture, the new managers inherit the obligations, rights and remedies of the predecessor, since the lease is a binding legal contract that cannot simply be disregarded in the middle of a residential tenancy because the there is a new party ###, a new property manager who had nothing to do with the original negotiation leading to execution of your lease agreement.  If your lawyer, upon more detailed review of the situation than what I can provide, thinks differently, I defer to that lawyer's advice on that point.  But for the time being, based on what I learned from reading your fact su###y, I believe that definitely the owner, and very likely the present management co###y, can both be defendants.  Even if the latter cannot for some reason, you secure your right to pursue your remedies as long as you have the owner as a defendant.  I would prefer both because it increases the likelihood that my client in this situation will recover monetary damages to justify the burden of litigation, and also because the property management co###y probably has liability insurance of some kind, which is highly attractive to a plaintiff's lawyer because it provides greater assurance to counsel that taking your case with little or no money upfront is a good business decision.  Where there is both insurance and a finding of liability, the lawyer who wins is going to get paid.  That's how contingency work goes.Be well,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43739.7166666667 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I read this over carefully and will try to ### address the legal issues as I perceived them from your fact su###y.  My brief feedback is as follows:First, you are entitled to your security deposits if you vacated the property, subject to deductions and charges as allowed under N.C.G.S. Â§ ### (see here: https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_42/GS_###.pdf).Second, most of the charges you described at the beginning of your post are considered normal wear and tear and would not be chargeable against you unless your lease said otherwise.  So long as the blinds and other objects in the premises were not damaged as a result of your own negligent, willful, intentional or reckless conduct, the damage that comes from simply living in a space is the responsibility of the landlord rather than tenant.Third, you can sue the owner and the current property manager (you should probably join the### co-defendants, although your lawyer can confirm this) for the injuries arising from both the furnace and the mold issues.  You should see a local personal injury lawyer about this, since they often offer either free or low-cost consultations, and also work largely on contingency-fee bases.  The lawyer you retain can ### your photographic evidence, pertinent hospital/medical records, and anything else that ### the link between the landlord's negligent repair and maintenance of your rented premises, per N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-42, and any physical or serious emotional injuries you have sustained.  Legal counsel can give you a better idea of what your claim might be worth, monetarily, once s/he becomes more familiar with all facts and corroborating evidence.Fourth, note that in North Carolina, a tenant cannot unilaterally withhold rent without a court order; this is true even when a landlord has breached the implied warranty of habitability under N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-42.  So if at any time you refused to pay rent until the mold, furnace, or other issues were addressed, and the landlord did not consent to your withholding rent, the landlord still has a valid counterclaim for any unpaid rental amounts (subject to abatement due to the habitability issues).  This possibility would not be enough to defeat your claims proper against the owner and landlord, but just be aware of this ###, and be sure that your lawyer is too, in case this is applicable to the facts at hand.Other than that, I think this su###izes where things stand.  Your next step is to find a good civil ### injury lawyer who will help you take this on.  I wish you the very best in this case, and in your living transition.  Have a blessed fall.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43739.0819444444 Thank you so much.  We never withheld rent and we always paid it on time.   This would not be an issue.  We also complied with all terms of our lease.  So when I take out a small claims suit, I am to sue the current management company and the homes owner.  I was told by the current management company that they did not have to comply with the terms of the lease because the lease was between us and the first management company.    Our lease states we paid $### $###..  They told us we have to recover from the original property management.   I keep getting told that it is not the current management companies problem.  43739.5625 The home we rented was passed through ### 2017.  Now that we have moved out the most recent company is charging us to replace ###-blinds (one which there was never a blind on the window), a ### blind that has missing ### when we moved in (picture proof), old vinyl ### doors (that needed to be replaced when we moved in), tears in the vinyl flooring (that was there upon moving in and pictures), ### the vinyl to the floor,  cleaning the unit after the homeowner wanted to finally replace the counter tops, and a lawn mowing that they did ###. On top of that the new management is not crediting the full security deposit that was stated on our lease.  They also pulled back the kitchen flooring and discovered dog hair and are charging us for that.  Yes, we had an approved emotional support animal, however so did the previous tenant and we also have picture proof. There is no provision in our original lease that states that we are responsible for replacing ###, closet doors, or mowing the yard a week after we vacated.  A rep. came to our house while we were moving and told us that the yard did not need mowing at that time.  There was black mold in the house and reported it to the management company.  While they did come in and put a fan in the ceilings, they did not get it from behind the walls.  This became a health issue for me.  I also suffered a burn to my foot last winter because of the floor furnace.  We put on the reason why we were vacated the house was due to the home owners refusal to do repairs.  I also have current pictures showing the mold in the house and on some personal items. We also filled out a move in report, but we are being denied a copy that documents all of the damage to the unit prior to us moving in.  They refused us the opportunity to be there for the final walk through so that we could fix these issues.  I sent them a letter requesting the return of the remaining deposit and a receipt showing that we paid to have the unit cleaned.  They sent us a letter denying our request with pictures showing the hair under the flooring, a cleaning receipt that was dated after the ### installers, and a notice that the bathroom, stove, and refrigerator was cleaned.Now I want to sue them for the return of the deposits.  Who do I need to go after? All three management companies and the home owner?  The current management and the homeowner?  The original management, the current management, and the owner? Also what am I entitled to recover?  Can I also ask for damages for the black mold problems?  And damages to my personal property that was done by the management companies' workers and the black mold? 43738.9618055556 Hello, Ms. Van ###:Hope you are well in ### County this October; I was just up in your part of the state during a visit to ### in nearby ### County.  I appreciate your asking this important question, which often comes up in various online legal forums in which I answer questions, based on unmarried couples.  Unfortunately, the answer to your question is no, unless there was an explicit agreement that what you contributed towards the household was a personal loan to the ###.  If you had been married, you likely could, upon the ending of the relationship (i.e., through divorce and equitable distribution of assets) make a very strong case that although you did not own the home based on what the deed said, you were still worthy of being ### for what you did contribute to the household.  However, in an unmarried context, the law would say that what you got" in return was the right to live there almost as a kind of ### of your boyfriend/fiance.  At most what your generous contributions to the financial health of your home would be the right to remain there for a short period of time before your boyfriend/fiance became entitled as sole owner under a deed to evict you if you did not honor his proper demand to vacate within a certain period of time.  Under N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-14 your ### would have to provide you seven days' notice if you paid regular expenses on a monthly basis otherwise it would be ###' notice if you paid yearly and two days if you paid weekly.  This would keep your ### from just kicking you out immediately should he opt to do that as a power move due to emotional fallout from the breakup.  This does not however give you any implied or express ownership rights in the real property or mobile home unit due to your unmarried status and your ### deed to the property.I wish I could bear better news than this but it is very likely that the law will side with your ### should this come to a legal battle.God bless you and your family this fall.  I wish you all the best things in life.### A. ### ### Esq."43744.0152777778 Hello, my question is about my rights to property. I have been living with who I considered to be a boyfriend / ### for ###. The deed to the property is in his name only and my name is not even on the utility bills although I am an authorized person to make changes to satellite or phone service. I had hoped we would be married but that never happened, I feel like he has kept me at arms length and does not want me to have any rights to that place. He still owes money on the property but it is almost paid off, there is a mobile home on the property which we still live in but it is old and in disrepair so it is not worth much. My question is do I have any legal rights to that property since I have lived there and helped him pay all the expenses for ###?43740.6881944444 Good evening, ###:Thank you for your question.  I believe that you will be fine as long as you do not reenter the landlord's property.  At this point, since you have already entered onto the property to take your things only, and because the landlord is undoubtedly aware that you did not damage the property or engage in any mischief or illegal conduct, the question would now be for the landlord, What do you really hope to gain here aside from expressing spite?  You already evicted the tenant and got what you wanted and now the tenant is not going to return."  Both the landlord and a sheriff's deputy called out to the property to trespass would likely be thinking the same ### at least the sheriff's deputy would have enough sense not to try to pursue this absent you doing anything extra to exacerbate a situation that is already ### by the day.  More likely than not the landlord will realize that she won the battle and the war and will simply move on.  If not you have a very very compelling defense of what is called "justification as well as qualified privilege"; a third defense is the "doctrine of consent."  All three legal theories arise from the fact that (###) you had a right even as a recently evicted tenant to retrieve your rightful property even if it ###t coming to the landlord's property to do so and (###) the landlord made clear in prior communications that she did not object to you doing so.  Show any texts or provide any emails or voicemails (or other evidence) to any law enforcement officer who inquires with you about your ### and ### onto the property since your eviction.  I seriously doubt that you will be prosecuted for trespass although for sure you should not ever reenter the property from this point on.  If you have anything left over on the landlord's property notify a police officer or sheriff's deputy who can arrange a time with you to come onto the property in order to avoid any misunderstandings with the landlord.All in all I think you are fine.  I hope that you soon transition into a stable and better living situation.  Blessings to you and your family this fall.Be well### A. ### ### Esq."43743.9715277778 I was evicted from my home, the landlord then told me I needed to have my belongings out by the end of Tuesday, ###. She let me know she didnâ€™t changed the locks, and anything left after Tuesday would forfeited. I reached out to her several times Tuesday to let her know Iâ€™d be coming to the property and when I got there, she never responded. I removed my property as instructed and now sheâ€™s threatening to have me charged with trespassing. 43741.7708333333 Good Saturday evening to you, ###:Thank you for asking this important question.  Unfortunately, if the deed indicates that the ex-wife is the lawful owner of the property, and the divorce decree or separation agreement from thirty (30) years ago did not require the ex-wife to be divested of her ownership stake in the property following the divorce, she and she alone gets to decide who lives there.  Thirty (30) days' notice is plenty of time as far as the law is concerned, to furnish her intentions of your vacating the space.  While it would have been a better practice for to notify you in writing, if this comes down to a legal dispute, the chances are very strong that the ex-wife will prevail over you.The $300.###, therefore, was not a bribe which is illegal; it was an incentive which is entirely legal.  Whether this situation is entirely fair depends on who you ask; you of course see this very differently than the ex-wife does, but if the ex-wife is the true owner, she can demand that you leave sooner rather than later, and in most instances, thirty (30) days is sufficient on her side of this matter.  If you do not leave within the allotted thirty (30) days, she can and likely will sue in small claims to evict you based on what is called holdover" status.  I cannot precisely predict what will happen since I am not fully aware of all facts relating to this situation but I do believe that the ex-wife is very likely to win.I wish I could be the bearer of better news but this is my best and most candid assessment based on the helpful and detailed fact su###y you provided here.  I hope that something beneficial will materialize for you very soon and just maybe you can eke out a brief extension before you leave; however whatever you can come to an agreement concerning be sure to have it all in writing.Blessings to you this fall and my condolences to you on losing such an important friend in your life.### A. ### ### Esq."43744.0291666667 I lived in this house for ###.

If the mechanic's shop is an actual incorporated business, I would look up the business name on the website with the North Carolina Secretary of State, and download the incorporation filings, as well as look at the addresses that come up for that business.  You would then sue the business rather than the individual owner.  See the directory information from the state at this link: ###.If you cannot find any confirmation that the mechanic's shop is an incorporated entity (i.e., LLC or corporation), you could then sue the person directly, for which you would need the owner's personal address.  Go to the North Carolina Board of ### voter directory at this website, ###/, and see if you can find a name and county that matches with what you presently know.  If you are sure you have found the right person, you now will know where you need to file.  (As you probably know already, you must file in the county where the person lives (if a person), or where the corporate ### principal office is located, or where the registered agent's address is located, which is available on the ### page.  Otherwise, your suit will be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, without a hearing on the merits.)Lastly, please read Rule ###.  See the rule here on how to properly serve a defendant in civil court: ###.  Section 4(j)(1) details how to serve a natural person, whereas Section 4(6), (7) and (8) details how to serve a variety of business organizations, incorporated or unincorporated.

I wish you success and productivity in your efforts.Have a blessed and rewarding fall,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43745.8986111111 Good October to you, Ms. ###:I appreciate your question.  First, we need to confirm whether a small claims magistrate or District Court judge (probably a magistrate, if anything really happened) actually entered a judgment against you without your knowing; this sometimes happens when a landlord files an action after the tenant has already vacated or abandoned the premises, and the landlord still has the complaint and summons served by posting it on the door of the premises (I have seen this happen before).  Any local landlord-tenant lawyer would be able to confirm this for certain, one way or the other.  If funds to hire local landlord-tenant counsel are an issue, I would contact the ### office of Legal Aid of North Carolina, and see if they can help you short ### on this at no cost to yourself.  Here is the information I found from the ### website (see below).  I hope you can soon obtain some clarity into this matter shortly, and, if necessary, obtain relief from this negative item on your credit reports.

I just recently tried to move and had to have a background check done. My previous landlord has an eviction on my credit and Iâ€™ve never been evicted! I went and got a receipt printed of the charges and it had me for non payment for March of 2018. He says he filed the eviction in March because he did not receive payment for that month but he received the keys back in February. I never received anything from the court and he is asking me to pay court cost. What should I do about removing this from my credit and getting this balance off of my name ?43745.8576388889 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and I hope graduate school is rewarding and productive to you.  Unfortunately, most of what you have already heard from the property management folks is correct; generally, landlords will not intervene in disputes between roo###es who are both on the lease unless those disputes somehow affect the landlord directly (such as the dispute i###ting the roo###es' timely payment of rent, or resulting in destruction of the property).  Absent that, the landlord in most situations will simply leave the roo###es to work things out ### themselves, since North Carolina landlord-tenant law does not oblige the landlord further.If you wish to leave early, you should consult your lease's early termination clauses, which can/will be enforced against you if you vacate early, unless the landlord approves a modification of your lease in writing.  Most apartment complexes with standard leases include early termination fees, a period of rent to be paid after the tenant vacates (usually a one or two-month continuation of regular rental installments), or a combination of both, depending on the landlord.  Such remedies are almost always enforceable in North Carolina, as long as they are not clearly egregious or excessive.If for some reason, my assumption that you are both on the lease is incorrect, and the roo###e is a subtenant of yours rather than a direct tenant of your landlord, you would need to examine the precise agreement (written or verbal) between you and your roo###e.  If the roo###e has a right to stay only based on a verbal or written understanding that she will pay rent in monthly installments, you most likely have an implied periodic month-to-month tenancy, which can be terminated by you or her with seven days' notice before the beginning of the next month, per N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-14.  You would provide notice (preferably written) to the tenant to vacate by ###, for example, and that notice would be effective as long as you unequivocally ### it by ### (i.e., this month).  If the roo###e stayed beyond the effective date, she would be a holdover" tenant of yours and you could then file a small claims lawsuit for su###y ejectment to remove her (note that you cannot simply change the locks and put her out as that would be a self-help eviction which is illegal in North Carolina).Unless the roo###e is a subtenant of yours with no direct relationship to the landlord you really do not have many legal options beyond leaving early and paying a penalty as provided in the lease or evicting the roo###e if necessary after providing proper termination notice under N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-14.  I hope this is helpful to you in sizing up the situation more precisely.  I wish I could offer more encouraging news than this but what you have already heard from the apartment office is correct based on North Carolina landlord-tenant law.I hope that this situation can be stabilized without undue ### from your personal life and graduate studies which I hope will lead you in a ### direction as you chart your professional ### in life.  I ### you for continuing your education in this way and for also trying to be the reasonable adult in these conversations with your roo###e.  Be well healthy and blessed this fall.Best regards### A. ### ### Esq."43746.8715277778 Hello,I am in a hostile living situation. My roommate left the kitchen dirty when I was to have people look at the apartment, and we recently had gotten into an altercation because she said she does not respect me and will bring whomever, whenever into my apartment. I have tried going to the apartment office but they state that the only thing they can do is mediate a conversation, in which she refuses to be apart of. I wanted to go over house rules with this tenant to establish healthy boundaries within our environment but she was hostile and refused to do it in front of management. In the lease it states the landlord is the only one who can approve of a replacement at the complex, yet where I live (The Corners at ### Lake) states that there is no landlord or upper management I can refer to. The last thing they told me documented today is that I am an adult and I should be able to have a mature conversation with my roommate. However, whenever I try to meet with her I am met with hostility, including phrases like, Say it to my face". Her dog who she pays to be there once a month ### every day and night at me. This is a detriment to my mental health and I feel I have no options. She also has not paid for ### and did not pay for two months of rent because she moved in late (yet signed the lease I did).

It seems the tax collector's office is who is foreclosing on your home. This is different than a typical / mortgage foreclosure. I will provide helpful links at the bottom, which will still apply to you in Cumberland county.

Has a date been set for hearing? Is there information to respond to a formal complaint? There are four initial ### you can take. Remember, you own the home until the final sale and upset bid happens. ###. If you own much of the equity in your home, you can refinance, get a second mortgage, or borrow money on your equity line. You can use this to pay your taxes and stay in the home. ###. If you have little equity, you can sell your home and use any proceeds to pay your taxes (you can also do this with a lot of equity, but that defeats the purpose). ###.

My money went to the buyer, city and county. (Please see the document attached that shows amount credited to the buyer.) I have also paid the taxes in full again from ###st- ### (see receipts attached) when the city and county sent me the ###, essentially paying for ###-### twice and the new owners portion from ###-###. I am not disputing the amount I am responsible for paying from ###-###, however I was paid twice plus the buyers portion and I want to be reimbursed for the overpayment. The buyers have the taxes escrowed into their mortgage. I was told by the closing attorney, my agent, the city and the county that if a payment was received from the escrow account for the buyer all monies will be credited back to the buyer because I have paid the tax ###s in full. How do I get a reimbursement for the monies that I have overpaid?43757.1097222222 I am trying to decipher all the dates of payments.  It appears that your payment to the city and county was made after the closing.  But it was the first payment directly to the tax collectors so they would take the funds and report them as paid.  The attorney properly charged the tax ### and sent the funds on to the new lender for the escrow account. At the time of closing that was the correct thing to do.  So, the attorney does not have your money, nor does that firm have any realistic way to obtain a refund.  You can ask the attorney to communicate with the lender's escrow department about the overpayment, but it may take quite a while to determine that there was an overpayment of taxes after the closing that has resulted in an excess escrow account.  Some attorneys would not consider this a matter they must consider since the closing statement was correct on the date of the closing.  It is going to be hard to find someone with any leverage to advocate for you with the escrow department that seems to have your money.  Try calling if you can get a phone number.  The first step is to ask the attorney for help correcting the mistake; then try to identify a process for obtaining a refund.  If the attorney ### help, you can write to the escrow department and try to get this corrected.There is not an easy way to get these funds paid out to a third party that they have no relationship with. They might pay the funds back to the closing attorney and get the closing statement corrected.43759.6111111111 I have recently sold my house on ###th and paid for my portion of the city and county taxes on the CD. However, the city and county mailed me the tax bills and Iâ€™ve paid them in full for the entire year. I want to know how to get the refund for the overpayment? The city and county said I am not due a refund and the monies received from the buyers escrow account will be credited back to the buyers. The closing attorney stated that there are no funds to be reimbursed and I will need to â€œwork it outâ€ with the buyers; however, I have no contact info for the buyers and they are not responding to their agent about my reimbursement. 43755.9111111111 Your first challenge is to figure out where your money went, or where it is now.  I think it is likely that your tax payment was part of your monthly mortgage payment.  If so, it is either in your escrow account with your lender or was calculated as a credit for your loan payoff (not likely).  Did you get a copy of the written payoff quote from your first mortgage?  If so, look at it for information about your escrow account - funds your lender holds for your tax and insurance bills when they come due.  Next is to look at the tax collection history for your property in your county system.  Was a payment received for your annual taxes for the full year before closing? It is confusing at this time of year, but usually the payments have not been made and a full year's worth of tax payments is sitting in your Lender escrow account getting ready to be paid.  They do not pay those once they receive a loan pay off and the money eventually gets returned to you.  If the payment was made to the tax collector, you have an issue with the closing attorney - but that is the least likely scenario.So check to see the situation in your escrow account and the history of tax payments made to the county.  Then you may be able to tell where your money is.43756.775 Good Morning, I am seeking legal advice because I recently moved away from an apartment complex in ###, NC. They have charged me over $###. They want me to sign a statement saying I'll pay for the remainder amount on my lease as well as these charges. I do not feel comfortable because, for example, one charge was $###. Also, I did not see this stain on the carpet before ###, I shampooed the carpet myself along with cleaning the entire apartment before leaving. Unfortunately, I did not take pictures of the apartment when I left, what should I do? 43756.4944444444 Ms. ###,I advise you to request details about the charges. Did they replace the carpet or just clean it? If it was replaced, I would ask how long the carpet had been in the apartment to begin with (ie was it time for it to be replaced anyway)? What was the condition when you moved into the apartment? If he matter isnâ€™t resolved, then they conceivably sue you for the damages in small claims court.You also mentioned they want you to sign a statement to pay the remainder of your lease ###. What caused you to move out? Did you break your lease? If so, was it because of something the landlord did? I ask these questions because if you broke your lease, then you are legally responsible for the lease period. However, a landlord has a duty to mitigate (lessen) the damages caused by you breaking the lease (ie they need to make sure they resent it as soon as possible). If you provide a bit more information to these questions then I can provide more specific advice.43756.5361111111 Thank you for the additional information. You are NOT legally obligated to sign anything. If you disagree with their charges, I still suggest you ask them for more information re: the carpet. If you donâ€™t resolve the matter with the complex, then they may report the â€œdebtâ€ to the credit agencies and/or sue you in small claims court to ask a judge for a judgment against you. If you are sued, you should not ignore any court papers you receive. If someone helped you move, then perhaps they can be a witness to the condition of the carpet. Good luck.43757.56875 Thank you so much.43757.7423611111 They havenâ€™t replaced or cleaned the carpet yet, they sent me photos and a billing statement a few days after vacating the premises stating that $### â€œcarpet damagesâ€.I did break my lease, I moved one month before my lease ended due to a new job opportunity. I understand and donâ€™t mind paying for the remainder of the lease period. I am wondering if legally, do I have to sign a statement saying I will pay them the remainder amount plus damages? I do not agree with all the damages being charged against me. 43756.7680555556 Youâ€™re more than welcome!43758.8416666667 Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Ultimately, the actions a landlord can take in the event of a tenant's default are largely dependent on the language of the lease agreement, so if you have one in writing, I would closely examine the default and remedy provisions to determine whether the landlord is acting properly.  While the first notice you got makes sense to me (although it was sent far later in the month than normally happens, which is after the fifth day of the month, when most landlords' grace periods end, per the lease agreement itself), the second one you received does sound strange.  I cannot say outright that the landlord could not have properly ### the second notice since I am not aware of the terms of the lease, but at my distant perspective, it does seem out of place.  Assuming that $###, and you caught up fully on all ### fees, there is no cause that I can think of as to why you would have gotten the second notice.  Your next rent obligation would be for the next month (November), assuming you pay rent at the beginning of each month.  If you are current on all obligations as of today (Sunday, ###), your lease cannot be terminated by the landlord unless this is an implied, periodic month-to-month tenancy, in which case the landlord can terminate early by providing you at least seven days' notice, orally or in writing.  If you have an implied, periodic week-to-week, by contrast, the notice period is two days in advance.This is the best I can offer based on what I know of this situation from reading your fact summary.  I hope it is helpful in some way going forward.  Hopefully your living situation will be stable, and you can continue to live there and pay rent with peace of mind.  I wish you the best this fall and winter.43765.8756944444 My landlord gave me a notice earlier in the month to pay $###.### ###th or the lease will be terminated on the 28th. I then received another notice but this time telling me to pay ###+ by the 28th of October. I paid the $### ###th. I just wanted to know if my landlord can do that?43765.1930555556 ###,Than it seems you are only ### obligated for the original Note. Sure thing. In these situations, it is best to let the other party make the first move legally speaking. ### may not hire a lawyer due to the expense or seek a settlement of a lesser amount between you both. It is typically a mathematical equation of potential ### to the cost of litigation to the cost/### of a settlement. If she begins official legal proceedings. I highly recommend a lawyer (keep in mind a vast majority of cases are settled at all stages of litigation). However, you are all open to drafting a settlement between yourselves to avoid legal expenses. I would be happy to refer you to a litigator if it comes to that. My office is ### and you can ask for ###. ###43768.5444444444 ###,Thanks for the documents, these are helpful. ### and yourself are responsible for the signed promissory note of $### plus interest. That note ### your home against that loan. Technically speaking, that $### could be dispersed to anyone for any reason, while you and ### would be on the hook for the amount. In the absence of any further agreement signed by ### and yourself, you do not ### owe additional monies to ###, nor is your home secured against the additional monies. Are you aware of any agreement the ### signed for the additional $###? What is your agreement between ###/Yourself and the ###? Did you sign anything with him?In short:-You/### are liable for the signed Note-Depending on your agreement with the ###, you may or may not owe him for the additional $### (it seems you do not owe him)-You do not owe ### for the additional $### as there was no agreement between you allGood luck,###43767.6805555556 As far as we know, given their relationship, the borrowing of the $20,###, but obviously stating we owe the money back. Furthermore, we have no agreement of any sort with him regarding this money, we actually explicitly told him we didnâ€™t agree to it. 43767.7013888889 I was curious if you could offer some advice on top of this... we have now apparently found ourselves in a situation where we either have to pay the $###... or we will likely have to hire a lawyer and potentially go to court in order for ### to understand we donâ€™t owe her the extra money. Would you advise we go the lawyer route and try and go to court, or would it be more beneficial to just pay the money and be over with it? I understand if you canâ€™t offer advice on this topic, but a lawyers perspective would be greatly appreciated!43767.9798611111 My husband and I built a house with money borrowed from a family friend. We have a promissory note stating we borrowed $85,### ###% interest. The money went into his fathers account who is a contractor and helped us with the house. He did not keep track of the money (after we repeatedly asked for an update). He keeps all his clients money in the same account and therefore, because he doesnâ€™t keep track he ended up using another customers money on our home, so he claims. He then went to the family friend, without our knowledge and borrowed an additional $20,###. We never saw any paperwork or receipts to prove this money went into our home, and now the family friend has created a formal document stating we now owe her $10###,000. The new document claims that under the promissory note we signed we owe her this money... which is not true, we never signed anything or were aware this additional money was being borrowed. We are trying to figure out if we legally owe the money. I have both the original promissory note and the new document from the family friend if need be. Thank you for any advice! *the file attachment of the promissory note is the original copy before we signed it, but this is the one we signed, I have the signed copy at home and can send it in later if necessary, I just wanted you to see exactly what we signed*43767.6638888889 Thank you so much! I will keep this in mind in case it comes to such a situation.43768.5979166667 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Reading between the lines, I think your ### are right about your landlord's primary motive for wishing to charge you these additional amounts, and that she is basically hiding behind the lease as a front to her financial need.  Even if that is so (as I suspect it is), she may do this since the lease actually does have a ### provision, which is enforceable even if the dogs are proven to be registered ### animals.  If you want to ### this situation and not fight with the landlord too much, my practical as well as legal advice is to anticipate your landlord's weakness and vulnerability (i.e., financial need), and use that to your advantage; by negotiating for yourself a written pet addendum that allows you to manage your losses comfortably, you can actually still be in the driver's seat, since your landlord appears to be far more desperate than you are.  If you and the landlord sign a written addendum to the lease (which expressly supersedes the no-pet provisions of the lease, while making clear that all other provisions in your current lease are still in effect, even after signing the addendum), that would give you and your ### what you want (keeping your pets at home), while also ### the landlord's financial needs a little.  Give a little to get much is what I would do, if the ### animals ### that much to you.Otherwise, the landlord can likely sue and win in small claims court for eviction under the grounds that you materially breached the lease.  You do not need to let the landlord know that you have been advised of this, but step back for a moment, plan your strategy, and use the landlord's need for a little more cash to your advantage while you still have maximum influence over the outcome, on the front end.  You will have to pay a little more than you would wish to, but will still be more or less in charge of your own situation.By the way, on another note, the subsequent buyer must honor your lease until it ends, in the vast majority of situations (it is a little different in ###, where the buyer can notice the current tenant ###, if the buyer in a foreclosure intends to live in the house as his/her primary residence).  Any wiggle roo###out terminating early in case of a sale that the landlord has promised you should be in writing; do not rely on any verbal promises to that effect, since it will ultimately be the written lease that governs if/when a sale happens.Hope this helps you somewhat.  I wish you and your partner a very productive path forward, with good results pleasing to you both.Blessings to you both and your dogs this fall and winter.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43767.7263888889 Hello,I live in a townhouse with my partner and our two dogs. I am currently in a situation with my landlord. She notified us ###. She requested to come into the home to ### with ###s that may possibly buy. We have her permission. Originally she agreed that if an ### buys the place, she will tell them that they must honor the rest of our lease. We also have the option to terminate our lease if we find a new place, she would just need ###. Our leasing contract has a no pets allowed section that we did sign. But our dogs are legally registered under my partner as his emotional support dogs. We have a letter from a licensed therapist to prove this. Since finding out that we have dogs, our landlord has filed for eviction dated ### and is demanding that we either get rid of the dogs and pay her $### $###. Now that our dogs are registered as emotional support animals she is demanding that we pay her $###. I guess my my question is, is she legally allowed to charge us this amount? We recently discovered that she is low on money and feel like the only reason we have to pay this amount is because she needs the money.43767.7111111111 Dear Esquire:Re: Long & Foster Management Company (managed my single family rental property) House rented for approximately seven years to tenant; ### by me first week in SeptemberThird party inspection ordered by company.

You are entitled to compensation for any damage that goes beyond normal wear and tear during the tenant's occupation of your property, and if you are owed a balance for reimbursements and/or repairs, I would recommend sending a final demand for payment with a specific due date to be made whole, after which you could pursue a small claims lawsuit if needed (small claims is for sums up to $10,000).  You would need to attach any invoices, admissions of debts, contracts, etc., that support your contention that you are owed money with your Complaint for Money Owed.  You would file this along with an alias and ### summons.  The forms are available at the Clerk of Superior Court's office at the courthouse, and at ###.  Note that you would need to file in the county where the defendant lives (if an individual) or has a principal business office (if a business; and if it is incorporated as an LLC or corporation, check the NC Secretary of State's business registration database to be sure you have the correct addresses for the registered agent and principal office). The filing fee for a small claims complaint is $###, and the service of process fee is $### Office.  Rule ### 4(j).  This is available at ###, under Chapter 1A of the NC General Statutes.Hopefully the final demand for payment letter will get you where you need to be, as that would be a cost-effective alternative to litigation.  Keep exact records of everything, as it appears you have already done.Best wishes to you in this matter.43773.7659722222 Dear Esquire: I recently refinanced my personal property and am being asked to send in a third promissory note for the transaction. Itwas explained to me that the first copy was lost and the notary came back two days later to have me re-sign the document. Thereafter, I was informed that the promissory note signature was cut off when ### into the system, and the documents destroyed, so they asked me to send in a new one that I received via email, printed out, and sent in via USPS.Following that transaction, I was told that, although they had asked me to sign the second one, it could not be accepted with a signature. So, they sent me a third note via ### and am asking me to initial the pages but do not sign the last page. The most recent promissory note was not a close facsimile of the previous note and I began to wonder what was going on. Doing some personal research I came across more than one article that stated, if more than one note exists, it is possible to satisfy the note and have another party present another signed note and demand payment even if one paid in full. I am concerned about sending in the most recent request feeling I may be inadvertently jeopardizing the satisfaction of the debt in the future if another party gets a hold of it.The original loan has been satisfied and all moneys dispersed according to the mortgage deed but the broker has implied that this ### may cause a problem with selling the loan.Perhaps you can understand that confidence is not high in the integrity of this broker and I feel like I am being asked to cover their incompetency, and (possibly) putting myself at risk, by sending them a forth promissory note. Question:Must I comply with their request and, if I don't, is that an ### of the law? P.S. I have not, as yet, received a copy of the paperwork generated at the closing so I have no documentation except the most recent email. Having been through this type of transaction before, I always received copies of everything I signed at the signing which raises another red flag in being outside standard protocol for the business.43773.7784722222 Good evening, Mr. ###:Good to hear from you, again.  This is a very confusing situation that I have never seen in six years of practicing law, despite dealing with various situations involving promissory notes, liens, mortgages and deeds of trust.  I think you were legally obligated only to sign what was originally agreed to when you first received the loan proceeds for this transaction; the only reason to sign a different promissory note, in terms of substance at least, is if you and the lender agreed to a subsequent loan, or a modification of the original one.  Something does not sound right here.If you have not agreed to any subsequent loans, I would sign only a reproduction of that original instrument, if you believe they truly lost it; I would also find a secure way to send ### scanned email PDF in addition to ### or ### ensure that they cannot claim that some snafu impaired due receipt.Sign a promissory note only if it conforms to what you and the lender agreed to in the first or last instance.  Be sure to keep exact originals and copies of everything, for your own protection.Be well.43774.0256944444 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question, and I am sorry you have had to deal with such a needlessly ### situation (I am nonetheless glad that you were able to happily remarry and get on with life, otherwise, which is a blessed thing).  I think a demand letter a lawyer to comply with the court's equitable distribution order might be effective, but just before that occurs, perhaps you can visit your local DMV tag office and ask if you can just sign away your interest in the vehicle?  That might just do the trick, since you are giving away an interest, and are not trying to take it away from anyone.  You probably will not get very far by calling the DMV (when I last had an issue with a car tag, I NEVER got through to an actual person after navigating the voicemail system for half an hour), but I think asking for a form you could ### relinquishing your interest, then mailing to your wife, will hopefully put an end to this.  Try that first, and then the demand letter route if needed.Wishing you the best as you try to wrap this matter up.  You and your wife have a blessed winter and Thanksgiving.43774.0326388889 Good morning, I will reach out to the DMV today! I'll be back in touch if no success. Thank you for your contact info.###43774.6083333333 Hello, and thank you for the prompt reply. I so appreciate your suggestion. I will give it a try, and if the DMV route doesn't work (by signing away my interest), then how much do you think a demand letter" would cost me to have drafted by an atty and sent to her? I am not in a financial position to afford much. I just won't my name off the car title and to have no responsibility for it (now or in the future) what so ever.Happy Holidays to you and your family as well. Again I am grateful for your time in responding to my inquiry."43774.1111111111 Most certainly, Sir.  I just wish your ex-wife would do what is right (per the court judgment) and ###, and just take care of this business.  People can be unreasonable and difficult sometimes.A demand letter can run anywhere from $### $250, depending on who you hire and how much you want the lawyer to be involved in terms of engaging with the recipient of the letter.  I usually charge $250, since in addition to the drafting and reviewing of drafts with the client, I also have to anticipate some response from the recipient that will also consume time on my ### not much, but I still need to anticipate doing more than simply sending the letter and doing nothing afterwards.Thanks for your holiday well wishes as well.  I am so glad that you found this site, and I appreciate your courtesy and professionalism.43774.1166666667 Mr. ###:I agree with your taking the DMV right first, which hopefully will work with no legal fees needed.  If not, reach out to me as follows:### A. ###,Attorney at LawPost Office Box ######, NC 27#########Good luck!43774.1902777778 Thank you for the kind words.

It's been ###. The car has no lien on it now, itâ€™s been (###) and she has been uncooperative in titling the car (just to her). I just want my name off the title. She has been in possession of the car since it was purchased. I never had possession of the car, I was just a co-signer when she brought the ### my name is on the title. We divorced in 2008, and she has been angry ever since because I got remarried in 2008 (and moved on with my life, and I am very happy).I recently found out from the DMV the car's tags expired in ###### (over a year ago, putting me at risk)! I want nothing to do with the car (if something happens such as an accident I don't want to be liable as an owner since I have NOTHING to do with the car). I just want my name off the title. I have remarried (2008) and she has remarried (2010), which is crazy for her to be so ridiculous about this. She is refusing to agree to meet me at the DMV for me to sign the title over to her, so she can re-title it in her name only.I don't have money to go to court, I just want my name off the title, so I can be done with her and this situation once and for all. It's not fair to me (or my wife) for her to old me on this title, when I have no interest in the car. Thankfully, I have possession of the title, as it was sent to me (when the car was paid off)-actually it went to collection for nonpayment, so to protect my credit (back then) me and my new wife had to pay off the balance of the car though we had no interest in the car and it wasnâ€™t in our possession ever. She just stop making the payments on the car after we divorced, but kept the car and has drove it ever since. Maybe if a demand letter is sent, threatening her with legal fees, (etc). she will get the message and comply by releasing me from the car title and in her taking full ownership.I would be willing to pay the cost of the new title $###, just to end this ordeal. But I would take it myself to the DMV, then have the new title sent to her (as I donâ€™t trust her if I gave it to her) that she would take the signed title to the DMV to get it switched over in just her name. 43773.7756944444 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  You raise several ###, to which I will try to provide brief answers, with legal authority cited when applicable.First, your landlord has a statutory duty, under N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-4###(a)(###), to provide residential premises that are fit and habitable."  Moreover when plumbing drainage and flooding issues arise giving cause for mold to grow that is considered an "### dangerous condition" under Â§ 4###-4###(a)(8)(l) requiring a prompt response by the landlord to rectify.  The landlord must have "actual knowledge" of the problem and then be given a "reasonable time" to cure the defect before liability accrues.  If the landlord does not cure the defect within a reasonable period of time the tenant may sue the landlord in small claims court for breach of the implied warranty of habitability in N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-4### and the remedy in court would be rent abatement for the period of time in which the habitability defect went unaddressed despite the landlord's actual knowledge of the problem.  A small claims magistrate will calculate rent abatement damages by the following formula: fair rental value of the premises as warranted minus fair rental value of premises in their defective condition plus any special or consequential damages sustained by the tenant (such as damage to your belongings that you mentioned).  However even though the tenant is entitled to sue the landlord in small claims court the tenant may NOT unilaterally withhold rent without court order.  If you withhold rent without the ### of the court the landlord may sue for nonpayment of rent even though the landlord is clearly in fault for breaching the warranty of habitability.Second you should not have changed the locks without the landlord's permission unless your lease agreement specifically authorized you to change the locks on your own.  The landlord is always entitled to keys to the premises since the landlord will still be entitled to enter the premises for the purposes of inspections repairs emergencies or other legitimate reasons to enter the tenant's home during the lawful tenancy.  If you have already changed the locks therefore you need to provide key copies to the landlord.  The landlord on the other hand should always provide you at least twenty-four (###4) hours' notice before entering your home except for emergencies and should enter at all only for legitimate purposes.Third and lastly your options here are either (###) to negotiate a mutually agreeable compromise in the form of a signed writing or (###) sue in small claims court.  While there is still some genuine disagreement between you and the landlord as to how much in the way of concessions they should allow I do believe that the deal you described in your posting is a fairly good one compared to what I have seen from landlords in the past who have never been as generous to my clients as your landlord appears to be willing to be at present.  However if you do not believe the offer they have made you is adequate you have the right to turn it down as the tenant but just realize that if no compromise can be worked out in writing (specifically saying that it supersedes your prior lease agreement) your only other option against the landlord is to sue for monetary damages and release from the tenancy.  Weigh your options on this very carefully.I hope this helps somewhat.  If you need specific legal representation and do not have funds to pay a lawyer you might contact the ### office of Legal Aid of North Carolina and see if they will offer a lawyer to represent you in this matter.  I wish you the very best this winter.  Blessings to you."43775.71875 Hello thank you in advance for any advice I have black mold growing in our apartment, I have asked the office several times to resolve the mold problem but they said they canâ€™t do anything else it is coming out of the air conditioner unit for sure, all of our belongings smell like mold and mildew so therefore we canâ€™t move unless we leave our belongings which I am still making payments on The office was gonna agree to let me out of my lease and let me keep one months rent but would not replace my belongings so I told them no I would not agree to that and since then they have been trying to enter my apartment and harassing us and threatening us that we feel scared I changed my locks do I have to let them in? They want to replace a water damaged floor without telling me why the repair needs to be done I tried to file a claim with my insurance company but they denied it stating that they do not cover mold sincerely Ms. ### 43775.5715277778 Dear ###,My car was hit on ### by a U-haul truck while it was parking and no one was in my car (damage only to the car), I got the name and insurance details of the driver and filed a complaint to the insurance company for repair (which is the same I use to insure my car).I have been chasing the insurance company for ###. is there any legal action I can take?Note: I did an estimation for the repair and it was around $ ###.Thanks and best regards### ### 43780.7611111111 Dear Sir, Thank you for your prompt response.Please advise what I need to do if U-haul does not have this complaint.Please accept my best wishes as well.Kind regards###43780.7854166667 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  I would follow up with U-Haul directly and make sure they have a claim on file, although eventual resolution of this matter will likely fall the driver's insurance, as your posting already contemplates.  For the time being, there is not much to do for now except follow up diligently with the driver's insurance company.  This is not likely to require a lawsuit, but hopefully they will have a final answer for you by the end of this month.  It sounds to me like you have done all the right things up to this point.I am not quite sure why the claim is still lingering without resolution for a ###; normally these things are worked out in ###-###.  If needed, you can reach out to a local personal injury lawyer to send a letter to the insurance company and apply some pressure to resolve your claim with finality and satisfaction.I hope your inconvenience comes to a close very, very shortly.  Have a blessed winter and Thanksgiving.43780.7756944444 You are very welcome.  Essentially, share with U-Haul all documentation and facts you have relating to the incident.  Whether U-Haul can help will depend in part on whether the driver purchased supplemental insurance for car accident damages as part of his/her rental agreement with U-Haul; if so, then U-Haul might indemnify the driver and pay you a settlement amount.  If not, your sole recourse would likely be against the driver individually, and his/her own private insurance.Your well wishes gratefully received.  Be well.43780.7875 Absolutely, Sir!  I am ### for you and hope that this all works out.  I wish very much for your family's peace of mind and happiness.43783.9444444444 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question, and I hope you and your family are safe and warm this winter.  Since ### are statutorily authorized to foreclose on homes in order to collect past-due membership ### assessments called for in the Declaration and Covenants, the only way you can prevent a foreclosure proceeding from going through is to either (###) pay the HOA in full now, or (###) enter into some WRITTEN arrangement with the HOA board, whereby you can stay a foreclosure proceeding pending your compliance with the payment agreement.  Otherwise, the HOA can foreclose as long as it follows all the statutory procedures of that process.  I hope you and the HOA board can soon work this out.Best wishes to all of you this winter and Thanksgiving.43783.9409722222 Hello, we got behind on our mortgage and have successfully entered into a loan modification.  We were also behind on our HOA dues.  They added $### $###. They want half before ###th or they will start foreclosure.  We can not afford to pay them that amount.  We want to keep this house.  There are ###, right now, is our only option  for housing.  What can we do to resolve this issue?###43783.9138888889 Thank you for your response.Have a good Thanksgiving. ###43783.94375 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  This is confusing to follow and the word eviction" is used much too loosely since it refers to an actual court proceeding rather than a notice; you have not been "evicted" unless (###) a small claims magistrate or District Court judge has signed an Order for Summary Ejectment and (###) the Sheriff has successfully executed on a Writ of Possession sought and paid for by the landlord.  With that said let me make the following general statements.If you honor the effective date on the termination notice you received from your landlord or if you are able to negotiate a different date if you need a few extra days the landlord will not sue you for possession of the premises although it may sue you for money damages if rent remains unpaid as of your last date on the premises.  Whether the landlord would sue based on a written termination notice depends largely therefore on whether you actually move out by the termination date mentioned in your notice.If you do not honor the effective date or negotiate a new date you could be sued in small claims court to be evicted based on what is called "holdover status."  If the magistrate signs an order in favor of the landlord you would have ten (###0) days to appeal after which the landlord's right to seek a Writ of Possession from the Sheriff become fixed.  Once that happens and the landlord pays the $55.### the Sheriff will post a notice on your door advising of the day date and time the deputy will return to force you out (if that proves necessary) and lock you out.  ONLY then can the locks be changed; until that happens the landlord cannot simply show up and padlock your door or lock you out by other means.  That is considered a "self-help" eviction which is illegal in North Carolina.So if you do not move out by the date the landlord demands and the landlord is successful in suing you in small claims you can expect about two to three weeks from the effective date before you are forcibly locked out or removed depending on how fast the landlord acts on the litigation threat and how crowded the local court schedule is for the magistrates who might hear your eviction case.I hope that your transition will be smooth as you find alternative living arrangements and wish very much that your family will soon have much greater peace of mind than is ### so far.  All the best to you and your daughter."43784.7638888889 I received an eviction notice from landlord and I have to leave the premises on ###th. A relative stopped by to visit and stayed a couple of days he was going through a divorce. The housing is evicting me because he had warrants in S.C. which was untrue. I knew nothing about this and he didn't either. I called the landlord and explained the circumstances and she told me that this was my second time that I had someone stay with me. I had my boyfriend on my least but we broke up so I took him off. He did come to the area because when he lived with me he mowed lawns for people but didn't live here. I wrote an appeal to the housing but went to take it to them and I had a vehicle that the dealer was coming to pick up I took the plates on the vehicle so I wouldn't forget but it was still registered and insured. After they ticketed me for this I decided they wanted me gone. I am disabled and had to look for a place to live. I recieved in the mail yesterday another eviction notice for failure to pay rent for Nov when the evicted me. They sent me the letter and I have now till the 22nd and not the 29th now. From the time I recieved this notice how long will I have before I have to vacate the premises. I will leave but was given the 29th and now the 22nd. I'm confused and scared I have a ###'t want to be on the streets. Can I be locked out of my apartment on the 22nd or can I go to court 43784.7159722222 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  Legally speaking, possession of property papers" is unclear to us lawyers.  What does that mean exactly?  Do you mean a written notice to vacate the premises by a certain date identified by the landlord?  If you are on a month-to-month arrangement the landlord MUST provide written or verbal notice to vacate at least seven days before the end of the tenancy as required by N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-14.  So if you are indeed a periodic month-to-month tenant and you were given only ### I agree with you that this is inappropriate and that it actually violates the law I have cited.Under the same statute cited above either landlord or tenant may terminate a periodic week-to-week tenancy with just two days' notice.  If it is merely a tenancy at will with no specified timetables for paying rent or of duration termination can be effective whenever given with or without advance notice.Now if the notice says seven days but the landlord is contradicting itself to try to rid itself of you sooner the landlord must wait until the effective date before taking any further action.  If you vacate by the effective date you are in no danger of being sued unless you vacate with rents or fees still ### which case the landlord can still sue you for money damages although the landlord may not sue you for ###.  If you do not vacate by the end of the seven days the landlord may sue for possession (based on your holdover status) and/or money damages depending on the status of the facts at the time of the lawsuit being filed in small claims court.We need to be clear about what papers actually showed up at your ### to terminate?  civil complaint and summons for summary ejectment?  other document?--so that I can properly and accurately advise you.  I have laid out some of what I think might be going on in this answer but if I have not clearly understood the facts in some way please feel free to fill me in a little more.  I will keep this question open for an extra day in case I need to respond to any follow-up questions/concerns you have.I hope you can get through this and land safely on your feet.  Wishing you the best in a challenging situation."43787.8548611111 My landlord filed possession of property papers on ### but the sheriff's department did not bring them until ###. That only gives me ###, instead of ###. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to get at least another two days. I have a child and need more than ###.    Thank you much.43787.8277777778 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question; it is a thoughtful one to ask before taking any steps to rent rooms from your residence, which for purposes of this question I assume to be a single-family dwelling.  I took a brief look at the City of ###'s ###, and while I saw no obvious answer to your question in my quick scan, I include a link to the Code so that you can read it more thoroughly than I can at present: https://###nc.gov/services/government/city-code#paragraph--213081 .If your home is within the city limits of ###, I would also contact the city's code enforcement and zoning offices to see if they can confirm your legal ability to rent rooms; my educated guess is that that would be a yes, so long as it does create nuisance problems with respect to noise or congestion of your street in terms of parking (nonetheless, check just to be sure).If outside of any ### incorporated limits of ### or any Wake County towns, check with similar departments on the Wake County government website.  Once you actually speak with a city, town or county official about the subject matter at hand, you can be further reassured that you can take on a couple tenants without incurring any civil liability to yourself.  If you decide to do this in earnest, I would suggest having a local real property or landlord-tenant lawyer in Wake County draft short leases for you, for extra protection of your rights.  I wish you the very best in your inquiries, and in this matter overall.  Have a blessed Thanksgiving, winter, and ###.43790.7715277778 Want to rent bedrooms to multiple persons.43790.7472222222 Good Evening, Thank you for the quick reply.  I am ### ###, ### daughter.  I am writing on his behalf.The issue is not the said property that was turned over.  What is the issue is my dad did not turn over his own parcel, ###.  Only the land that is next to it.  My father's parcel is separate, as far as I understand.According to my dad, and my sister in law, no one said that the house and the parcel it sits on was being turned over.  That would not make any sense.  It would leave my dad with nothing. My father believes that the x at the bottom was incorrectly placed.  It should have read does not."  It certainly wasn't explained.  Again my sister in law and the children are not disputing this.  We all understood that the property belonged to my brother and not the home. As the ### I know this to be what was understood because before my father turned the property over to my brother there was conversation.  My brother would be deeded the property and in the event of the death of my father we would share the proceeds of my father's home.  Unfortunately my brother passed first.  So now my ### as well as my sister in law and this real estate mess on  top of it.  Again none of the parties involved are in disagreement as to what we thought the contract was about.Is there anything my father and sister in law can do at this point?  My sister in law needs the money as she no longer has my brother's income and my father can no longer live in a house without my brother's help.Sincerely### ###"43790.9381944444 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  This is a bit confusing.  If you conveyed the entire parcel where your home sits by General Warranty Deed, 100% of that parcel would have been your son's as of the execution of the deed in ###016, and yes, as you state, it would have passed to his surviving widow and children upon his death, if he died without a will.  I can understand why your daughter-in-law would have a right to sell her interest, but do not understand why you would still be a material participant in any transactions involving this property once you deeded it over to your son in ###016.  I assume that the deed was recorded within two (###) years of execution, which is what North Carolina law requires in order for deeds of gift to be valid.I reviewed your attached sheets from the ###, which tracks with what I expected I would see after reading your fact summary.  I see no reason why you would be a vested owner with any interest, unless you deeded only part of your parcel, rather than all of it.  Otherwise, your daughter-in-law and your grandchildren (either in their own capacity if at least ###, or through a guardian ad-litem if a minor) have the right to sell anything.That is the best I can ### based on my reading everything available to me here.  Am I missing anything, factually?You should not be paying property taxes if you are no longer the owner, and the mortgage lender likely did not need to be notified, since federal law does create a narrow exception to the written notification rule when a real property owner deeds property that is mortgaged, to a direct heir, such as a son or daughter.  But this of course does not ### the lender's right to continue being paid even after the ###, unless the lender agrees for the new owners to assume all responsibility for the outstanding mortgage.  I wish your drafting lawyer had advised you of all this when the ###.Best wishes to you this Thanksgiving.43790.9208333333 Hello, Ms. ###:Thank you for your very helpful addition and clarification; I did not have the benefit of seeing the contract in your father's prior post this evening, but only the two pages of the General Warranty Deed.  The exact nature of the problem makes sense to me now.Thank God you all are in agreement as to what the problem is/was; if not, this would be a huge mess.  It still is a mess, and will be a headache to resolve, but at least you do not have the problem of a family feud over what was intended.  You will definitely need a highly competent, experienced real estate lawyer for this, as this is not the kind of thing a non-lawyer can handle on his/her own, no matter how educated, smart or resourceful.  The easiest and most ideal situation is one in which your local real estate counsel could file a Corrective Deed that more accurately splits the lines between the two parcels, supported by two attachments: (###) a survey that confirms the boundary lines of what was supposed to be two discrete, separate parcels abutting one another, and (###) an affidavit in which all family members with a potential interest in this property (and who were parties to the contract you mention) all sign their assent to the Corrective Deed, under oath and seal.  That assumes your local lawyer believes this will work.  It would need to be cleared with the title company as well, since we are dealing with a General Warranty Deed, and not a Quitclaim or Non-Warranty Deed.If that is not feasible based on your lawyer's opinion, a judicial partition action before the ### County Clerk of Superior Court may be necessary.  If the lawyer who drafted the original deed is still alive and practicing, go back to him first and seek his assistance in fixing this.  Otherwise, you may have to hire alternative counsel from ### or Wake County to handle this.  This is going to take some doing, but as long as you all in the family are not fighting over this, it is more likely than not that this can be fixed in a couple of months.I really hope so.43791.15625 In ###.  He died suddenly in March, ###.  Upon his death, I went to sell my house.  My daughter-in-law wanted to sell the property.  So we sold it together as a package.  When the contract was drawn, we were told that the general warranty deed included my home, and that I owned nothing.  Because my son did not have a will, all of the real estate was in probate, and when my youngest grandchild turned TERM000###95, ###/### ###/###.The house and my parcel is mine.  There was never a search for a lien, and the bank that holds my mortgage was never notified.  I have continued to pay taxes and mortgage.

As if I am able to sale the land?43792.0534722222 Good evening, Ms. Corn:Thank you for this very good question.  The short answer is yes, you can sell, but the buyer needs to be aware that this landlord-tenant lawsuit is pending.  If the buyer is okay with dealing with the last ramifications of this as it plays itself out, that is entirely fine; the key thing on your end is that you are ### and clear with what is going on, from the very beginning.If you win on appeal, the issue becomes largely moot since you can pay for a Writ of Possession ($### $###; $###) and have a deputy sheriff come out within about ### (give or take a day) to have the tenant forcibly removed.  If for some reason you lose and the tenant gets to stay a little longer, the sale can still take place, but the buyer will have to honor the lease until it expires, or the tenant and new owner come to some written agreement that supersedes the prior lease agreement, and ### the tenancy.  So while this might be an undesirable complication for the buyer, it really does not prevent the sale from happening, as long as both buyer and seller are ### and straightforward about all of this on the front end of the ### in writing.Hopefully you have a closing attorney helping you with this, as this person will know how to handle this aspect of a real estate sale contract.I hope the sale is successful, and I wish you and yours a blessed winter, Thanksgiving and ###.43792.1069444444 I guess that I need to talk to the buyer.  Do I need a lawyer for district court?   I'm avoiding him because he is so massive. It is bad be a prisoner in my own home. I suspect that the home is a wreck. So when we do the final walk through we will accept t he home. How long does it take to get into district court normally.. Thank you for your help.43792.1631944444 If you can afford counsel for the District Court appeal, I recommend that strongly.  I have no idea when the judge's clerks will schedule your next hearing, but I would inquire accordingly with the courthouse staff.  The hearing itself should take only an hour or so once the judge calls your case.  Best regards.43792.1659722222 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  This arrangement is odd, and I have never seen a situation in six years of practicing law (and dealing with landlords of various types during such period).  My first ### as a lawyer tell me that if the lease says it and everyone signed it it stands."  However I also think there is good ground to believe that a penalty fee this high contradicts the equitable intent behind the North Carolina General ### drafting of the North Carolina Landlord-Tenant Act (N.C.G.S. Chapter 4###).  Here are my thoughts straight from the Act as I believe relates to your issue:###.  N.C.G.S. Â§ 4###-46(a)(###) provides that late fees regarding RENT should not exceed either $###5.### (5%) of the total rent typically owed whichever is higher.  This sets the tone for how ### should be assessed on a monthly basis throughout the statute even if it does not specifically describe situations like yours.###.  N.C.G.S.Â§ 4###-46(d) does not allow for late fees that attach to failure to pay water or sewer services provided under N.C.G.S. Â§ 6###-######0(g).  Please look this statute up as I think your water and sewer services are likely covered under this section but you still need to confirm.Nos ### ### but it will likely require a lawyer sending the landlord a legal warning advisory letter to this effect AFTER reviewing your lease and confirming thereafter that the arrangement is unenforceable.  This is not an argument that I believe you can ### make to the landlord yourself without counsel although I could be wrong.  It depends on how reasonable your landlord is when confronted with facts and legal authority.  The landlord is almost guaranteed to argue that you and your roommate signed this agreement fully knowing what you got yourself ### a bad counterargument but still one that may be legally insufficient.If you have a couple hundred dollars I would pay a local landlord-tenant or real property lawyer to look into the situation and confirm this for you (and send a warning to the landlord if my ### on this website prove correct).  If you cannot afford counsel for this matter contact the local Legal Aid of NC office in ### and see if they would be willing to review the situation and correspond with the landlord to iron this out.I hope this helps somewhat although I note that this is an incomplete answer at present.  Hopefully it points you in the right direction.Have a blessed Thanksgiving and I wish you a strong finish to your Fall ###. "43794.8298611111 I rent a home in college housing in ###. Me and my ###.

What can I do to get them to give me a copy of the fees?### ###43797.5763888889 Good afternoon, Mr. Law:Thank you for your question, and I hope Thanksgiving yesterday was meaningful to you.  The general rule of contracts is that a party that signed a written contract is legally presumed to have understood all terms of that contract, absent fraud, duress or mutual mistake.  If the instrument you signed made clear that this was a lease for a tenancy of a defined, set time, the law will uphold the contract as legal absent the mitigating factors I mentioned (or mental incapacity by one of the parties).You have the right to terminate the contract early if you wish, but be forewarned that if there are early termination penalties reserved in the lease, those penalties will be enforceable should the landlord decide to charge them against your account with the office.  The landlord will then have up to at least two months where it can charge you for rent, before the law will presume that it has had a reasonable chance to mitigate damages by exercising due diligence to find a suitable alternative tenant who is willing to pay roughly the same that you agreed to in the lease agreement.  If you pay nothing at all, the landlord may or may not sue you in small claims for it, although I am not sure whether that would happen since the landlord was put on notice of your intent not to move in long before the unit was to be physically occupied by a tenant.  One could argue in this situation that the landlord has not really suffered much in the way of damages, but that still does not mean that the landlord cannot pursue early termination fees.See what penalties apply under the lease agreement, and negotiate something in writing if at all possible, with the landlord, that allows you to move on with minimal damage or expense to either side.Have a productive and rewarding winter.43798.8354166667 So I signed a lease thinking it was a hold like to hold a spot for a place but it turned out to be an actually lease. It doesnâ€™t start until ###. Is there anything I can do. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair to make me pay for a place on a contract that hasnâ€™t officially started43798.7944444444 There are no stipulations listed anywhere about what happens if you terminate the contract at all43798.8534722222 While that is unusual, that works to your benefit.  State your unequivocal intentions IN WRITING, and then the clock begins to tick for the landlord to find an alternative tenant.  If we begin December with that notice already furnished, the landlord will have no choice but to start alternatively making arrangements.  The most it can claim is that it was burdened by a month in not having you aboard in January, but that is something of a stretch.  Hopefully they will not take you to small claims court over just one month of rent.  You run a risk that that will happen, but it is a moderate one at most.All in all, despite this being less than ideal, you are in a much better situation than most tenants are in similar situations.43798.8597222222 Good morning, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  This seems to be a perfect storm of misunderstandings and ### ### by the change of property management, as you say.  Since the management company in place at any time has the authority to police parking and enforce rules concerning it on the complex's private property, there is little you can do, legally, if the new management is unable or unwilling to help you get the car released.  Although I am a lawyer and have an advantage in many situations that others do not due to my having certain legal expertise, I would not have an advantage in a situation like yours, and would simply have to pay the ### fees to have my car released, assuming I could not persuade the new property management to pay it for me.The towing company will get paid no matter what, since it acted on what it was told by the prior management was a ###, lawful order to tow.  It is not the towing company's responsibility to figure out whether towing your car was proper, but only to confirm that the property management officials making the call were in fact vested with authority to tow, and once that is confirmed, to simply follow orders to tow.  No matter what happens between you and the new apartment management folks, the towing company is legally entitled to insist on being paid.Again, an unpleasant situation that could have been avoided if the prior management had not sent you and other tenants conflicting messages about what each space was designated for, but probably one in which very few remedies will be available to you, assuming the new management does not wish to be of much help to you.  Sorry to say that, but it is true based on my prior experience with similar situations in the past.I hope you are able to reclaim your vehicle at minimum expense and burden.  Have a productive December.43802.6201388889 Last night the local towing company, ### Towing, removed our car from our apartment complex because it was in a â€œhandicapped spaceâ€This handicap space serves as a placeholder for what would be legally mandated spaces that adhere to state regulations for people with disabilities. this space, among many others.

If she agrees to put your belongings on the porch, get her to do that and go get them immediately, with no discussion.  You are not likely to get all your belongings, any of your money or any sense from this person.  You need to get away and stop engaging as soon as you get what belongings you can recover.

Mother signed Quit Claim Deed to You. ###. ### has a loan in the remaining amount of TERM00133### for the property. Questions:Has ### started a foreclosure proceeding? Has the mortgage been kept up with in regards to payments? Does the loan include the home and the property?Can you upload a can of the contract?Answering you questions:You own the property as your mother presumably properly deeded the property to you. ### can call the loan due, and again assuming it is a secured loan, they can enforce their lien and take possession of what it ###. To start the foreclosure proceedings, they will not initially require original documents, however, there is a point at which you can contest and require them. They could then appeal to a higher court after that and argue that the originals cannot be produced. This is a long process. Yes, the loan is assumable and in all parties best interests. However, it is up to ### to allow you to assume the loan (they typically prefer this).It seems you may have a few options: refinance, assume loan, negotiate with ###, etc. Good luck and let me know what further questions you may have. ###43803.7694444444 My Mother passed in ###17.

To keep it short and simple, this is what you need to know: if rent goes unpaid by the end of the grace period allowed in the lease (assuming there is one; otherwise, by the due date), the landlord has ### options.  He can proceed against you alone if he wishes; or he can go against the other tenant alone if he wishes; or he can proceed against any ### alone; or he can proceed against EVERYONE who signed the lease as a primary tenant or ###.  This is what joint and several liability" means.  Everyone is liable together for the whole amount and as long as one signed the lease in promising that the landlord will get paid the same can sue any or all of them.  Whether the landlord does this against everyone is entirely within his discretion.Normally one proceeds against the primary obligors first (in this case you and the roommate) and then against the secondary obligors (the co-signors) if the first method does not work.  But if the landlord wishes to sue all of you at the same time that is also possible although he would sue only you and the roommate if he is suing only for possession of the premises as opposed to money damages.I really hope that something can be worked out that allows you to remain in your home and keep your finances stable.  Because of situations like this one has to always pick one's roommates carefully.  Often the landlord will show some grace and compassion when at least one of the tenants is being professional and ### you in this ### that is because the landlord wishes to not because he is required to.Blessings and best wishes to you this winter and I pray for you a ### and productive ###."43804.6590277778 Hello - I signed a year-long lease with my cousin, ###, in ### for an apartment in ###, NC. Our rent is $###. Halfway through September, she decided to move to Florida with her boyfriend and refused to continue paying for the rent. After much deliberation, I convinced her to continue paying the rent while she lives in Florida. Currently, she has not kept up with the payments. She still owes November rent (claiming that she mailed it in on multiple occasions but that there were problems with the mail), owes ###, and our December rent is due today, which I also suspect will not be paid today. ### has ignored all phone calls from my landlord, while I have kept in constant touch with him. Two days ago, he called me concerned about the rent not being paid yet and the balance on our account. As this lease is a joint lease, my landlord asked that the money be paid by Thursday (today). He told me that someone, including me, must pay for the remaining balance on the account as soon as possible. He implied that Thursday was when the money would be due. When ### and I signed the lease, we each were asked to include a co-signor. For ###, this was her step-dad, ###. I am reaching out because I feel in over my head and just want to know whether the remaining balance on the joint account falls on ### as a responsibility to pay as he is the co-signor for ### or if I am responsible for paying the balance as a joint lease member? I have never been in this situation before, and I am just searching for information so that I can competently talk with my landlord about what responsibilities I have on this lease. I tried to attach my entire lease here, but it said the document was too large, so I have attached screenshots from my lease that may be of help. Please let me know if there are any more screenshots you need of the lease or anything that I missed when giving you information. I very much appreciate this. ### ###43804.5625 ...which North Carolina unfortunately is not...." ###. Reason ###. But I continue. thanks for your insight. "43805.1076388889 Are there any federal or state statues that offer ### or ### the standard financial qualifying criteria that rental ### ### for themselves and adhere to in the normal marketplace?As an SSDI recipient, my current landlord offers me the standard qualifying income threshold equally as they do others who can work. Specifically a gross income of 3X the monthly base rental fee. With a fixed non ### income, I sense a disadvantage I cannot control nor rise above and wonder if my landlord must follow any instructions from the government to edit this threshold for the Disabled.Thank you.43804.6944444444 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for this very worthwhile question, and I hope your ###.  Unless your landlord or housing authority is participating in a federal ### program through U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the only metric landlords use on any standardized basis is fair rental value" based on the town city or locale where the rental unit is located.  This gives the landlord almost unlimited discretion as to what to charge for rent (though not affiliated utilities) if the federal government is not involved.  I am not aware of any corresponding North Carolina statewide program that stabilizes or imposes ceilings on rents in this state; I am fairly certain that I would know if there was such a program statewide since I have handled real property and landlord-tenant matters in North Carolina for almost six years.  The lack of statewide ### program does not however prevent towns and cities from enacting such programs at the local level (by the city council for example) so long as the local program does not conflict with federal housing regulations promulgated by HUD.  You can contact your town or city hall or search on your municipality's website to see if any such local programs exist in ### County.You are correct that many landlords will factor qualification based on the 3X formula that you describe; I think that is right on target for many landlords when they do initial credit and income checks on prospective tenants.Blessings and best wishes to you this winter and in ###."43804.7048611111 Good question.  I think HUD is where you should start, since states and cities follow HUD's lead.  Federal law sets the overall framework, and then local and state entities try to work within it, with cities usually being the ones that add other exceptions (or very liberal, ### reform states, which North Carolina, unfortunately, is not; states like California, or cities like ###, are the areas where the types of additional exceptions you are seeking tend to be most robust).  All the best.43805.0430555556 Thank you. I will follow through on your suggestion and seek evidence for ### at the county and city level.   In the event there is no exception 'on the books' can you share any thoughts on a ### beneficial forum where an argument for this type of exception might begin? Rather than soliciting my city council whose every ordinance can be ### by ### in the form of the ### Rule in NC; I'm thinking HUD; a federal entity that issues policy on housing rights and rules, would be a beginning. But are there other entities you'd be willing to name?   Thank you and Happy Holidays to you.  43804.7805555556 You are very welcome.  God bless you and may you ### in unique, reassuring ways.  Have a good winter.43805.1180555556 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  This happens routinely with contractors, and I have had at least three clients in the past with situations similar to yours.  Here is the general information you need to know.  First, always make sure that the exact terms of payment (especially if they are to include installments) are in writing, and that the written contract includes and ### ALL agreements and understandings between the parties; otherwise you get a situation in which the contractor claims that the owner promised to pay a certain amount by a certain stage, and that that was the reason the contractor stopped work, whereas the owner will present an entirely different version of the story.Second, whenever a contractor has furnished labor or materials at an owner's home, that entitles it to place a lien against the real property if the labor/materials have not been compensated for; the contractor has ### (the ### time limit) to file the lien with the Clerk of Superior Court, and then has ### (the ### time limit).  Based on what I have seen in a past lawsuit over this same issue, the contractor will be compensated to a degree under what is called the equitable doctrine of quantum ###" (Latin "to each what he deserves") even if the contract has not been fulfilled from the owner's point of view.  The question in that instance is how to make the contractor ### whole to a point even if it means work is not yet completed and the parties agree to go their separate ways due to disagreements over the deal.The lien will not be released until it is satisfied either by private ### between the parties or a lawsuit if no agreement can be reached on resolving this.  Once the satisfaction occurs either way the contractor's attorney will file a discharge instrument with the Clerk thereby removing the lien for real estate title search purposes should you ever decide to borrow against or sell your property.It is in the best interests of both you and the contractor to try to resolve your differences if at all possible and avoid litigation which will be costly for both of you.  I would engage a lawyer if you can afford one to handle the negotiation over this matter.  I hope you two can work this out in a manner that both of you feel that you are being made whole.  Best wishes to you this winter."43805.7375 I hired a contractor to complete an insurance claim. I have been unable to verify the work because i have been out of the state. I asked for him to provide photos of he completed work. He k###w prior to the start i maybe away and required proof. He started the project well before i sig###d the contract or paid the initial deposit. A few days later he stated he was do###.  I contacted a friend  in the state who said the work has not been completed. I explai###d that to the contractor and he said again that is was and beacuse i refuse to pay. He was putting a lien on my home. I received ###. I agreed to pay the deposit and 60% of the contract. At that point i received the same ###. I expressed that it was not unreasonable to provide me with proof of completion. I them received an email stating i have a lien agent assig###d. The email has no contact information. I went to the website and it looks like something that was suppose to ### filed prior to the contractor being work. My question what is the process for the contractor getting the lien and how do i remove it. And if i cant what happens to my property. 43805.5055555556 Good evening, ###:Thank you for your question.  The landlord is at fault for not retaining your ### written notice, which is binding upon it since you timely submitted it in accordance with your lease.  The tenant's rental file transfers from one landlord to the other when a sale occurs or a new management company takes over, so legally that should not be held against you.  If you can ### the written notice that you sent in accordance with the lease that your new landlord is still bound to honor, then you should be treated as if you effectively terminated your tenancy with ###' notice.I believe that you are entitled to have the new landlord stand by the lease and the notice you correctly submitted.  However, it will help your case if you can show proof of what you sent, when you sent it, and what your notice said.  You might consider calling the ### office of Legal Aid of North Carolina and asking if they can briefly represent you long enough to review the same documentation you attached here (thank you for that), and send a legal advisory letter to the landlord, warning it to honor the notice that you properly submitted, and not to punish you with further rent charges or penalties past the effective date of termination specified in your ### notice.  Often, pressure from a lawyer or legal entity like ### can help preempt a situation before it ### into a formal legal dispute.  Hopefully that is all you need to make it smoothly out of this situation, and avoid paying another month's rent on top of your first mortgage payment.Congratulations on becoming a new homeowner!  I know it took a lot of hard work to build up the positive financial history it took to get to this point.  Hopefully you can get this landlord matter cleared up so that you can free up your cash for more pressing priorities.  Blessings and best wishes to you this winter, and in ###.43806.9638888889 I appreciate you.  Let's make this a great year.  I am excited for you as you prepare to live in your new home.  Good for you!43806.9680555556 I sent the ###, there is now new management. I was notified AFTER the ###'t have notice and that the automatic renewal would start at the end of my lease if we did not communicate in writing. At some point rather old or new management the letter I turned into the office was lost. The new management is honoring the old management's lease agreements. So who is responsible for the lost letter. and can new management charge me for a mistake not made by me? There is a clause in my lease that states  If without Our written consent or as otherwise specified in ### You attempt to ###inate this Agreement prior to the last day ofthe original ### or prior to the last day of any subsequent ###001120 You will be in default of this Agreement and You shall be liable to ### the payment of Total Monthly Rent until (a) the end of the original ###or the end of the subsequent month-to-month renewal ### (whichever ### at the time) or (b) until the date that We receive a rental ### a subsequent tenant who enters into a lease agreement with Us for ### whichever one of these two events occurs first." We have paid our rent for ### - ### and our lease ends the 15th how do we "###inate" our lease without consent? As it makes more sense for us to break the lease early and pay the remainder of the lease rent than to pay an entire month because new management wants to extend until Feb for the ###. I appreciate any help its not a lot of money to them but it will be to me as I will be paying my first home mortgage when they want this payment. "43806.9548611111 Thank you so much!! I appreciate your time and advice, I will definitely reach out to the ### office and hope you also have a great ###! 43806.9673611111 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and as a ### graduate, I love hearing from someone from ### County!  This is an interesting situation here.  I would offer the following points:Any fixtures installed are now part of the realty, and accrue to the benefit of all co-owners equally.  I am speaking here particularly with the kitchen cabinets and other improvements in mind.  This is especially true if all co-owners contributed toward the financing of the project.Whether one of the co-owners is released from mortgage or deed of trust obligations is ultimately up to the lender.  As long as all three of you are on the deed, the lender will insist that you all remain on the present security instrument until the debt is paid in full, or the property is sold and the debt is in that process extinguished.  If at some time later you and your husband buy out your mother-in-law, the lender might entertain releasing the mother, but that would likely require a new loan application in which your and your husband's ### is assessed on their own, without consideration of your mother-in-law's credit history.  This is entirely up to the lender, one way or the other.Regardless of whether the mother-in-law is released, she will continue to have rights of ingress and egress onto the property as long as she is on the deed as an owner.It would be helpful to everyone if the three owners entered into and signed a written ### agreement that governs the relationship among the owners, and which can be enforced as a contract should any party breach a material provision.Otherwise, you three likely have an ### situation until/unless the property is sold, or the mother-in-law is bought out.  The most pressing matter, in all likelihood, is the fight over the kitchen fixtures, which one owner does not have the right to unilaterally ### out if the other owners do not so consent.  The legal presumption would be that the kitchen fixtures are now part of the permanent structure of the realty (as said before).  The law assumes that what was installed in the kitchen, even if it was installed by just one of the co-owners, raises the property value for the benefit of all owners who have an investment in the property.Hopefully you three can get a local lawyer to draft an agreement that would be acceptable to all of you, which would preempt some issues you all are likely to have over the next few years.  I strongly recommend ### ### of ### & ###, P.A.  Best wishes to all of you this winter and Christmas, and in ###.43808.9666666667 My husband and I bought a home with his mother, all three names are on the mortgage and deed. My mother in law wants to move out and return to her previous home. We just renovated the kitchen using the ones from her previous home and she now wants to remove the kitchen and return it to her previous home, at this point we arenâ€™t even ### about the cabinets she is just harassing us, threatening us, and is just going to leave and we are going to have to assume her part of the mortgage my question is if we are solely paying the mortgage can she still come and go as she pleases? We do not have the money to buy her out right now43808.7986111111 Thank you again, God bless you and your family as well! 43809.0479166667 Thank you so much for answering our questions, we will try to work out an agreement with her and have it drawn up so maybe we can get some peace. The information you provided was wonderful and we do appreciate it so very much!43809.0444444444 You are absolutely welcome.  Call up ### and tell him that ### ### of ### recommended that he work with you on an agreement.  I think he would charge something reasonable for a service like this, which could put so much of this to rest, and give you some peace of mind.  God bless you and your family!43809.0458333333 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I would report this to the housing code enforcement officials with your local town or city if you live within the incorporated limits of a municipality (such as ### or ###, for example), or with ### County government if you live outside a town or city.  You can look up the local government website of the appropriate entity, and/or call the town hall county government administration office, depending on which applies.Otherwise, you would have to sue your landlord in small claims court for what is called rent abatement"; this is calculated as fair rental value of the premises in good condition minus fair rental value in defective condition plus any special or consequential damages resulting from the landlord's breach of the implied warranty of habitability found at N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-42.  See here: ###The small claims magistrate has broad discretion to determine what is a fair rent abatement based on the inconvenience you have suffered as a result in living in premises that are not "fit and habitable" per N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-42(a)(2).Filing fee for small claims is $### (payable to the Clerk of Superior Court) plus $30.### (payable to the Sheriff's Office).  Hopefully the ### safety regime in ### County will be sufficient to get the landlord to do what should have been done a long time ### without your having to go through a small claims action.  But nonetheless if you seek rent adjustments based on the habitability issues and your landlord will not accommodate you in some sort of compromise you would still have the small claims option.All the forms you would need for small claims are at the local courthouse in the Clerk's main office.Blessings and best wishes to you this holiday season and in ###."43812.6902777778 The landlord has promised for ###. Our apartments have damage from the leaks. It recently was also brought to the landlord's attention that the smoke alarms are almost ###-dated.Who do I contact?43812.5930555556 How can I get the borrower (### ### ###) off the mortgage of the house as I am the co borrower and the borrower is incarcerated for murder in another state and I have been the one making the payments for this property for more than ###. without revealing my new home address as I fear for our safety from him and his family. 43812.8569444444 I have continued making payments on the house and still am and all mail can go to that house address for any documents I no longer live there due to concern of our safety. I wanted to remove his name from the property since he is incarcerated for murder and will most likely not be ever released.43812.88125 The easiest way to get someone removed from ownership is for the person to sign a deed.  This does not sound reasonable or likely. But it would be easy to send a deed for him to sign in front of a notary if he were willing to do that.If you do not get his agreement, you need a court to divide up the ownership or remove him for some reason.  There are not many ways to get a court to do this.###.  You can ask the court to divide the ownership, after giving you credit for the expenses you have paid.  But, your address would be disclosed and it would be expensive -- you need an attorney to help you with this.###. foreclosure takes him off.   Unfortunately it also takes you off, so that does not sound like an answer.What benefit are you getting from paying a mortgage on a property you do not occupy? Is it rented?43812.9048611111 This sounds like a confusing and worrisome situation.  The first thing is to be clear about the difference between ownership and debt.  It sounds as if you each own half the property and that you are both signers on the debt as well.  On top of that you indicate that you are worried about your safety from the co-borrower and his friends and family. I cannot tell if you are out of the house you are making payments on and just want to get your share of the equity or if you want to get full ownership of the property based on paying the mortgage without help.Getting an owner removed from title is not easy.  But there is a procedure called partition" in which you could ask to have the Court order the house sold give you credit for mortgage payments and so forth that you have been making and then divide any left over between two of you.  But if you don't want anyone to know where you are it will be almost impossible to properly arrange a sale of the property.The lender will not remove a borrower from the mortgage because they want to keep the right to go after everyone for payment of the debt.  But that is not too important for your purposes -- that is just a question of who is obligated to pay the debt.Your important question is how to get his name removed from ownership.  That will not be easy without a lawyer to help you and if you are trying to keep your location a secret I don't see how you can proceed.Maybe there is a lot here I am misunderstanding. Does this clear things up a little or am I too confused to help.### ###"43812.8722222222 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  While it is not uncommon for the tenant in this situation to have to pay some rent (usually for up to at least two months) following the early vacating of the premises under a lease, a $5,###.  I strongly suspect that if a lawyer pushed back against the apartment complex, the latter would not adhere as strongly to the idea that you really owe them $5,000.  Normally in North Carolina, two months' rent, or some predetermined buyout" or "early termination" fee applies depending on what the lease says.  The reason I refer to two months' rent is because in North Carolina the landlord has a statutory duty to mitigate damages (i.e. rental losses) by employing due diligence in finding a suitable alternative tenant who can come in and pay the same or roughly the same rental installment that the tenant who is leaving early paid.  This is required by law and when these disputes come to court it is typical in our state for the small claims magistrate to allow the landlord at least two months to find a suitable alternative before it is ruled that the landlord failed to sufficiently mitigate damages.  The two-month ### is one more of standard practice rather than a ### rule under law so it can depend on the circumstances.I would contact the ### office of Legal Aid of NC and share with them a copy of your lease.  See if they would be able to represent you and correspond directly with the landlord in an effort to lower what the property is claiming you owe.  Ideally the property will come to its senses once legal counsel on your behalf is involved and a written settlement agreement could be assented to by all relevant parties.  Once all terms of the agreement are met (most likely including a payment of a smaller amount by you in exchange for the property's release of any future litigation or claims against you including for nonpayment of rent that could end up on your credit as a civil judgment) all parties would be forever discharged of legal obligations to one another and the dispute would be resolved with clarity and finality.  That is how I would approach this.Hopefully the Legal Aid folks can straighten this out for you soon.  God bless you and your family in both North Carolina and New ###."43816.2125 So I lived in North Carolina with my partner. My father passed away and we had to come back to New ### to take care of my silbings. We lived in an Apartment complex and they said there was no way to break the lease. Now we owe them over 5,000. And they said they will set up an payment plan but we cant afford and it would only give us a year to pay but we have other ### to pay as well. I just would like some legal advice what we should do.43816.1173611111 I had a ### washer floor my house. I somehow ended up dealing with the liability department at ###. After months of going back and forth with them I finally decided to claim it on my homeowners insurance. The insurance company came out did an inspection and cut a check for the amount of flooring damaged. They then proceeded with my notes and information to file a demand through the subrogation department against ###. They demand what they paid out to me and my out of pocket expenses other than the main one the cost I paid to keep my house from getting mold a dehumidifier rental for $###. I received a message that they had settled with ### for 50% of their demand. I received the break down as...Coverage ### $###Out of Pocket Diagnostic X2 $###Out of Pocket Part Shipping $###Out of Pocket Appliance Replacement $###Deductible $###Lighthouse Paid- $### (50%)Your out of Pocket -$### (50%) this total is missing the $1000.### $150.###.You are entitled to 50% of the recovery totaling $###.###.This doesn't even cover the deductible much less the out of pocket expenses I incurred since according to there demand they didn't even ask for the expenses from the clean up I paid out of pocket. The insurance company did not even reimburse me for the clean up of the flood either. They also do not want to give me the depreciation value until the floor is installed but because I still am having issues with them from Hurricane ### I will not be able to meet the time frame in order to install the flooring and receive the depreciation. I had been asking ### for way more than what they had sent over on my behalf. Is there anything legally I can do to try and ### some of the funds? 43819.8125 Consider sending a copy to the Landlord in case they try to shuffle you off.  And let me know if you have any more trouble.### ######43823.6020833333 If you have a written lease that allows you to stay until ###20, try sending a copy of the lease to the new owner.Unfortunately, there is a rule that a buyer is not bound by a lease if it lasts for more than three years and is not recorded.  So check the terms of your lease.  Is it for a shorter period than three years?  You could have been in the house for ten years, but signed a new lease in the last year or two that would protect you.  Your rights are all in what is written between you and the original landlord.  So, get it out and see what it says.If you do not have a written lease, you do not have anything protecting you from eviction.

If you only want to sue for $10,000.###, however you would have to file in the county in which the defendant (Seller) resides.  Some counties may have a cap of $###, however, so call the county court clerk's office to be sure. If you would like to sue for more than $10,000.###, for example, your medical bills or pain and suffering from the mold issues, you would file in District Court if the amount you're asking for is less than $###.  For more than $25,000.###. Of course as your demand for monetary damages increases, so does the complexity of the court proceeding.  In small claims court, for example, it would be easier to represent yourself (also known as pro se") because the process is designed for lay people to represent themselves.  If you would like to read more about the small claims process and learn about what forms you would need to file visit this site:  ###  If you decide to proceed for more than $10000.### you will have to proceed in District or Superior Court.  In those courts you will be treated the same as an attorney and will be bound to the Rules of Civil Procedure and Rules of Evidence.  As such it would be difficult to represent yourself in district or superior court.   On a related note if you decided to pursue recovery for your health issues you would be required to provide your certified medical records from your provider.  If those records directly link your breathing issues to the mold in the RV then that may be proof enough of your bodily injury.  If not you will need testimony from your provider or another qualified doctor to link your breathing issues to the mold in the RV.  This may prove tricky if your provider is unwilling to testify and you need to hire another doctor to review your records examine you and link your breathing issues to the mold in the RV.  Hiring a doctor for this work is costly.  Also ensuring the doctor's opinion and testimony is admissible in court can also be difficult.  It is possible a plaintiff's attorney would take your case.  I recommend contacting a plaintiff's attorney in your area.  Most will provide a free consultation to discuss the strength of your case.  They typically do not require upfront payment but rather their fee will be 30-40% of whatever you might recovery from the suit.  Some plaintiff's attorneys will cover the costs of filing fees hiring doctors to perform examinations or provide testimony and other case related fees - but some will require you to pay them immediately.  More likely they will be added on top of the attorney's 30-40% fee.As you can see it may be simpler to file in small claims court to recover the $10000.###.  For example here is the Complaint you would file in Magistrate Court.  ###  There is no such form Complaint in district or superior court.  You would have to draft a Complaint in ### with the Rules of Civil Procedure and plead legal causes of action such as fraud unfair and deceptive trade practices.  Those will require you to be familiar with North Carolina case law and statutory law.Also it is important to note that your case has some difficulties.  For example you purchased the RV site unseen.  You did not have the RV inspected before you purchased it.  You did not have a written sales contract.  You did not have the seller write down the disclosures regarding the ### issues. Some questions the magistrate judge is likely to ask in small claims court:Why didn't you have the vehicle inspected?Did you ask about flood damage?  Or storm damage?Why did you not complete a written sales contract?Did you properly transfer title to the RV? Do you have the ### paperwork including receipts?Do you have a receipt of your payment of $10000.###?  (If you wrote a check that may be sufficient proof of payment).Is your friend with you to testify as to the Seller's disclosures?  If your friend is not available do you have a notarized statement from your friend attesting to the Seller's disclosures?I recommend you thoroughly review the NC courts website regarding small claims and file accordingly.  While the county clerk's office cannot provide legal advice they can be very helpful with filing and procedures.Best of luck."43838.6395833333 This 5th wheel was bought site unseen until day of ### ### of ### friends that can tell you that the words above were said in both my friends and ### presence and upon looking at any damage there... when told of problems with rv ### did not ### propane in old ### advice to sue for mold problems and lies about water ### from ### that was a year ago in ###desperately need someone to look at the mold and how long has it been ### has been there longer than year that I have had ### have had to go ###office for breathing ### very low and cannot breath ### that this information can become a lawsuit to get my $### to hear from you soon!~thanks so very much### ###"43825.8777777778 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:A blessed new year to you and your family.  Thank you for your question.  You have raised several questions here, and while I am not entirely clear on what is going on, I will offer the following general points for you to consider.###000###87.  An eviction must happen by summary ejectment through the small claims court if the landlord demands the tenant vacate, and the tenant does not comply with the landlord's demand.  Unless the written lease says something specific to the contrary, the landlord must first furnish a written ten-day notice letter, stating the sums unpaid that are to be paid before eviction is filed, with ten days to pay it.  The landlord could then sue on the eleventh day if not all sums are paid.  If rent is not the issue here, the landlord can still demand that a tenant vacate if the tenant has breached the lease in some other material way (other than not paying rent), or has committed an illegal act on the premises.###000652.  It is possible that the landlord's conduct with respect to the roof constitutes a habitability defect under the implied warranty of habitability, found at N.C.G.S. Â§ ######000652-######000652.  More specifically, the landlord has a general duty to make repairs to ensure that the rented premises are in a fit and habitable" condition under N.C.G.S. Â§ ######000652-######000652(a)(###000652) and under Â§ ######000652-######000652(a)(8)(c) an "unsafe roof" is considered an "### dangerous condition" that must be fixed within a reasonable time after the landlord has "actual notice" of the problem.  You can sue your landlord as the plaintiff in small claims court for what is called "rent abatement" for the months during which the roof was not adequately repaired.  This would be the diminished fair rental value for such time due to the habitability defects as contemplated by N.C.G.S. Â§ ######000652-######000652.  The magistrate has discretion as to what this discounted amount (or refund) to the tenant should be but as long as the tenant is reasonable in the request in the complaint the magistrate is likely to be sympathetic to the tenant's position.###.  Your landlord cannot require you to do her yard work for her unless your lease agreement so provides.  Also if you have a set ### for this lease period she cannot charge extra fees or rents that contradict what was agreed to in the lease.  She can raise rents or fees only by (###000###87) written and signed modification as between landlord and tenants and (###000652) as a condition of lease renewal when your current lease ### expires.###.  Finally as to privacy the landlord may enter the premises within reason for legitimate purposes such as repairs inspections and emergencies.  However the landlord must not abuse this limited privilege by repeatedly entering the tenant's private living space during the residential tenancy.  Whenever possible the landlord should provide at least twenty-four (###000652###) hours' prior notice before entering your space (emergencies excepted of course).  Otherwise the landlord is likely violating your right to "exclusive possession and quiet enjoyment" of the premises you are renting.If the landlord has breached any of the above-described legal norms and/or rights and you cannot persuade the landlord to correct her behavior I recommend hiring a local landlord-tenant lawyer to review the facts and communicate with the landlord directly in order to resolve any disputes or conflicts that might otherwise accelerate into court fights (although you might still have the option to sue if the roof issues are not addressed to your satisfaction).  If you cannot afford a lawyer you can always contact the closest office of Legal Aid of North Carolina to see if they can help you on a short-### basis.  Below is a link to the offices across the state:###If you are interested in retaining counsel of your own consider using ### "Find a Lawyer" feature to search for real property and/or landlord-tenant lawyers in the greater Hickory area.God bless you richly in ###0006520###0006520.  I wish many wonderful developments in your life."43831.73125 Hello! I am wanting to know how can my landlord have me move out if she did not give me a written notice and did not take evictions papers out. Plus she did not let the homeowners insurance company know about her renting the place out either. She did not fix the roof before we moved in she waited ###. She has us do the yard work this summer or she would have raised the rent for maintaining her own yard work. She would not inform us when she would come by she invaded our privacy all the time she harassed us and caused problems for us, what can be done?43831.39375 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  Because this situation might ### a number of ###, and because I have not read the lease and any modifications involving Ms. ###, I will attempt a general description of how subleases and assignments work in North Carolina landlord-tenant law.First, it appears at the very least that Ms. ### attempted to enter into a sublease agreement with you, although that would require a written agreement between you and Ms. ### that she will take over lease payments; otherwise, if you and Ms. ### do not have a written agreement between you, there would need to be a written modification between Ms. ### and the landlord, signed by both parties, making clear that she is the new tenant.  Similarly, a signed modification would also need to be entered between you and the landlord, by which you provide consideration in exchange for being released early from your tenancy.  My guess is that your reassignment" fee constitutes such consideration (a good thing on your end) and obviously you helped recruit Ms. ### to be your successor as tenant.  So the only two things that I think might be missing ### I cannot say for sure from my distant point of ### the following: (###000487) a written contract whereby the landlord expressly agrees to release you of any further rental or other obligations to the landlord in exchange for your paying the reassignment fee and finding a successor tenant and/or (###000652) Ms. ### actually making good on her promise to become the successor tenant by signing a new lease agreement with the landlord in your place.  If either or both (###000487) and (###000652) are missing technically the landlord has a legal right to hold you liable for future rents up to around two months (this is the period in which many small claims magistrates in North Carolina who hear landlord-tenant cases give landlords to mitigate their damages by finding substitute tenants).  For any period after two months small claims courts are unlikely to hold that the landlord still should be entitled to rent from the tenant who ### early.I think much of this depends on whether Ms. ### actually signed a new lease with the landlord.  If she failed to come through at the last minute the landlord may ### argue that you have not yet held up your end of the deal despite your best efforts to do so before you left.  If you pay any further rent your reassignment fee should either be refunded to you or used as a credit against one of the payments you might make.If you left behind a roommate and Ms. ### is no longer in the picture the landlord has a right to pursue the rent against that roommate you and/or any guarantors or co-signors of payment.  If Ms. ### did sign a lease the landlord's remedies are against Ms. ### your roommate and any guarantors or co-signors but not you.Several factors are at play here and I hope I have clearly described them as to make them discernible on your end.  If needed you and your stepdad should retain a lawyer for a brief period of time to review any leases or other documentation you have and send the legal department an email or letter explaining your legal position.  For the most part I think the law is on your side but if there were minor slip ups on Ms. ### end there might still be grounds that support the landlord's theory that you still owe them rent at least for the short ### (again likely up to two months).Please let me know if I can clarify anything further.  I hope you will enjoy significant financial personal and career ### in ###0006520###0006520--and hopefully sooner rather than later.All the best to you and your family this new year."43839.7770833333 I hope so too, Ms. ###!  I think you did your absolute best to be fair, honest and ### with both the landlord and Ms. ###, and I hope that you and your stepfather will be rewarded for it.

I moved out and turned my keys in on ###th and was out of country for two weeks for Christmas. I was told that the girl was approved and signed the lease and was supposed to move in early January. She still had to send some information and move in but that was the only thing she had to do. Unfortunately she hasn't been responding to me or to the apartment complex manager since last week and it's ###th and someone has to pay the rent. The rent is normally due the first few days and the grace period was till ###th and now each day is considered late. The apartment complex claims that since she did not move in I am still responsible for the rent even though she signed the lease. I looked into my lease and it does not mention such a rule. My responsibility was to find someone and to pay the re-assignment fee which I did. What should I do? I currently live in another city and paying for two apartments is not something I can afford and I am scared that they will put delinquent payment on my credit history. I also do not have a job. The manager does not have any proof where it says I am obligated to pay if someone else failed to move in and is either not responding to my messages or calls and delaying the whole situation. My stepdad asked him to have his legal department contact him in order to see how they would react and they said that they are busy but they certainly will notify them and today they completely dismissed the whole conversation from the previous day and continue to claim that my account is delinquent and I need to make a payment today. Unfortunately most of our conversations were done over the phone and I have only a few text messages as a proof but I will ### a screenshot of a message where he says that the girl- ### ###, signed the lease.

I've gave all paper work on my service animal and it's been a week now and I haven't heard anything from my landlord telling me that I'm ok. She did tell me that she is waiting on there lawyer to look over my paper work.  And that I can not have my service animal on the property until she hears something.  And I'm still waiting, I've been without my service animal for a week and I've spent my rent money on boarding for him.43840.8034722222 Ms. ###:It is precisely for this reason that you should always demand a receipt contemporaneous with ### use an online payment portal using bank draft or credit/debit card.  For now, you simply have to wait and see if the payment is found and processed.  If not, you and the landlord are possibly going to have a hard time.  In the meantime, as a precaution, try to gather whatever information you have of payment as ### carbon copies, bank records, ### that if you need to hold your ground and tell the property that their losing your check is on them, you can defend yourself should they sue you in court.  Legally, you are in the right, but in the absence or a receipt or clear proof, this situation hinges largely on whether the property is willing to admit its mistake and do the honorable thing by you.  If they do not, then this can get very contentious very quickly.

What are my rights as a tenant and what can I do now?43841.0152777778 Hey ###,Without digging into very specific statutory and common law, it seems that the owner would not be obligated to sell you the land. You own the mobile home and addition and they own the land. Depending on the situation/lease the land owner may request you leave with your property (again subject to your situation/lease). However, what type of lease agreement do you have? Does it mention the mobile home/addition? There may be potential rights to enforce under the lease. Additionally, there may be a number of other solutions (ie buying the land, extending or entering into a new lease, agreeing to leave the addition and take the mobile home, etc.). Good luck and let me know if you have questions. ### 43846.9395833333 I purchased a mobile home this year. I currently pay rent for the land that the home was originally on. The owner and seller built an addition onto the home prior to my purchase. The addition is fixed onto the property and is not movable. The addition is also built onto the home to where it would be difficult to separate (same roof system, siding joined together). My lease will be coming up in a few months and it will be my responsibility to move the home. The addition, which I also own, canâ€™t be moved. Is the owner obligated to sell the land to me due the fact that a part of the residence is permanently fixed to the land? 43846.8666666667 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  This is a somewhat tricky situation, I admit.  Assuming your friend is the homeowner in this house (as opposed to her renting the house from someone else), I think your best option (although it may not necessarily be a good one) would be to assert a claim against your friend's homeowner's insurance policy.  You would have to find out who your friend's insurer is, however, and then press your claim.  If you cannot locate such information, your only other legal option would be to sue the homeowner in small claims court (for any sums up to $10,000) for the value of your damaged items.I think both approaches are problematic, although the homeowner's insurance claim MIGHT yield a little more progress than the small claims suit (which on the whole I do not recommend).  The reason is that if there is no proof that the homeowner was negligent in causing this water heater to explode, you cannot win a claim directly against the homeowner, because there is no strict-liability standard for appliances that malfunction in a person's home, even when the malfunction results in the type of losses that you as a short-term guest sustained.  In this situation, it does not sound like the homeowner was at fault in any way, but rather that the water heater was simply defective--in ways the homeowner could not have reasonably anticipated.  If so, going directly against the homeowner is not likely to be successful.A third, more creative option might be for you and the homeowner to work together in pressing your own claims (for different reasons, of course) against the manufacturer of the water heater.  Ideally, the homeowner would see the benefit of working with you on this since there is a possibility that she too would be reimbursed for certain damages, and then an investigation could be undertaken, which would provide a written, official record of the incident, and stronger evidence for the claims for compensation you would wish to make.  This is what you would use for evidentiary support when pressing a claim against the manufacturer's insurer.If you cannot get the homeowner's insurer to investigate and provide a written investigative report, you can still contact the manufacturer and ask to press a claim.  However, without an official report, your recovery/settlement amount is going to be a lot less than if a report was done by a homeowner's insurance company.  I would take as many pictures of possible of the defective heater, the condition of the house, and your articles of property as possible, and put these and any other evidence you have in a safe place, then forward over to the adjuster on the manufacturer's end.  You might receive a couple thousand dollars for your trouble, but not significantly more.  The adjuster's job in any interview or recorded statement made on their end is to devalue your overall claim amount as much as possible, so be careful (though still truthful) about any answers you provide in an interview or recorded statement.I think you have a somewhat steep ### ahead of you, but if I were in your situation and I had the legal knowledge that I in fact do, these are the options I would consider pursuing.  Engaging with the homeowner's insurance and manufacturer's claims department are much more advisable than trying to sue the homeowner in small claims court.My heart sincerely goes out to you as you work through this situation and your transition with work and where you live.  I pray for a powerful ### for you and your son very, very soon, so that you can rebound from this with greater resources and peace of mind.  God bless you richly in ###.43850.0916666667 While away for a week my friends water heater exploded,water continuously poured for days, filled entire house pretty much and ruined almost everything my sin and i own.

If your husband purchased this property from his own investment or other funds, this would be separate property, and there is no legal requirement that he include you on the deed or in the negotiations or contracts leading up to the sale.  (Whether this is right in terms of marriage, however, I do not opine.)Hopefully what your husband does know is that, in North Carolina, when a married person wishes to SELL or otherwise CONVEY property to a subsequent buyer or transferee, the spouse is required to sign off on the deed even if only the grantor spouse is listed on the deed, in order to guarantee to the buyer that there will be no legal claims in the future by the ### spouse against the buyer, whether based on inheritance or divorce.  If your husband sells or gifts the property to someone, that someone having clear title" means not having to worry about collateral claims against the property should you get divorced or should your husband die at a time relatively close to the real estate transfer.In a divorce situation this would likely be separate property for equitable distribution purposes unless your husband used joint marital funds to purchase the property (in whole or in part) or unless your efforts during the marriage result in an ### rise in the fair market value of the property (such as you managing it or adding improvements to it despite not owning it per deed during your marriage).For the time being there is little you can do legally speaking since this transaction is now complete.  How this plays out in a divorce or subsequent sale (if during the marriage) is uncertain.I hope you and your husband can work this out and come to a peaceful and loving understanding.  God bless you both in ###."43850.9541666667 Hi there, my husband bought a house with his stock last Friday. He didnâ€™t invite me to the signing nor is my name on anything.

Intestate succession means that the property is distributed to the next of kin the property was distributed to her spouse and if there was no surviving spouse to her children. The owners would be the "Heirs of ### Doe."You would be entitled to an interest in marital property; however you are not entitled to an interest in separate property. In the state of North Carolina all real and personal property acquired before marriage or property acquired during the marriage by bequest devise descent or gift (e.g. a will or intestate succession) is considered separate property.Therefore legally you are not entitled to an interest in the property; however within the separation or any divorce you may negotiate the transfer of any interest in the property he may have to you. Should he pass prior to this any interest would go to:To whomever is in his will.No will before a divorce: Maybe to you but his two children could contest this in an Estate Proceeding and depending on what is presented could succeed.No will after a divorce: To his two children."43852.7145833333 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question, and a blessed new year to you.  The correct answer to this question might depend on the precise wording of the deed of trust language, because if it was professionally drafted by someone with expertise in real estate law, there was likely a contingency provision providing for what happens when the mortgagee dies; if so, and the provision authorized the property to be sold, this situation you describe might have been legal.  However, if the deed of trust and any other related contracts prohibited an expedited sale or other acceleration, or if the paperwork says nothing at all about death of the mortgagee, the heirs of an intestate decedent would inherit the rights of enforcement of the deed of trust--although there is a ### here, since the estate might have to sell the property if the mortgagor defaults, AND your father's debts cannot otherwise be paid except through sale of real estate.  If, by contrast, the mortgagor is able to get current on payments and uphold her end of the bargain, her rights to live in the house under the deed of trust remain ### by your father's death.Depending on (###) what the deed of trust says, (###) what your father's financial situation at death was, and (###) whether the mortgagor is in default, this situation can go several ways.  It is impossible to say for certain online as to what should happen, but this gives you an overview of what factors might be in play.  I suggest that you and your siblings, as soon as possible, consult with a local probate lawyer, who can read the deed of trust and any other paperwork relating to the sale, and also ask you more pointed questions about your father's finances, assets and liabilities at death.  Once a lawyer knows all of these things in detail, s/he should be able to give you a very precise (and accurate) opinion as to whether anything needs to be done at this point--including but not limited to whether taking legal action against the sale of your father's property is appropriate.God bless you and your family this year.  Be well.43855.1368055556 Your Question:edit textHi. My question is about my late fathers property being sold without my sisters and knowing. My Dad had a property and that he sold and had a deed of trust with the current owner. Owner put a percent down and was paying off property monthly. When my Dad died, she stopped making payments and advised she needed to sell the property. My Dad had no will and was not legally married. Today, my Dads next ### neighbor called and said that a new person moved in and the property was sold. Is that legal when we did not know about it as his beneficiaries?43855.05625 An abandoned vehicle parked on a public street will be towed away and eventually the owner of the facility where it is stored will have a mechanic's lien on it that can be exercised to seize the vehicle.  If it is on private property and abandoned, the owner of the land may also be able to have it towed away for trespassing on the property.  So, if you ask a towing company, they will refuse you.  But if it is abandoned they have established procedures to get those vehicles off the streets.  There is probably not enough current information associated with this vehicle that would allow them to trace it to you in Maryland if you abandon it somewhere.I know this does not sound very honest and ### to just walk away, but you have shown that there is just no feasible way to solve the problem of how one responsible owner deals with the other owner who is not responsible.  It is as  hard as you think.  The only way I have ever discovered is to allow a tax lien or a mechanic's lien attach to the vehicle and allow the lien holder to seize the vehicle.Good luck with this!### ###.43857.9166666667 I have a van that is titled in my name and my ex-husband's name.

The Maryland MVA can't help me because it is titled in NC. The Maryland State Police won't declare it abandoned because it is titled in NC.The most recent advice was from the NC DMV. They said that a court order can remove his name from the title. However, they were very flippant when asked where to go to get such a court order. They said any judge" could write such an order even one in Maryland. When I called Maryland I was told no judge would touch the case because the van is titled in North Carolina. That leaves me trying to figure out where or how to even start a case in NC since I no longer live there. Which court would have jurisdiction here? Who should I call to begin a case? What kind of case should I start? How long would it take?Like I said I just need to get rid of the van and don't know who to turn to.

I hope it remains so.No my initial question was not meant to imply that you could be treated this way as a guest but only that if you were a "tenant" of sorts you could use the habitability statute (NCGS 42-42) with greater weight as a tenant than as a mere social guest.Best regards."43858.9729166667 I am afraid there is not a clear simple answer to your question.  Your father will need to qualify for a new loan.  That means that a new company will examine his credit rating, his income levels and his assets to determine whether they would want to take a risk on this loan.He probably does not have enough income for them to qualify him for a loan, regardless of the other factors.  So, your next option would to be to consider if there is a family member willing to be on the loan with him. Do you or another family member have enough financial stability to be able to do this?If no one can help him, and he does not qualify there is really not an option for renegotiating the loan except to go directly to the company that holds the loan to negotiate or possibly consult with a bankruptcy attorney.  If he is very poor and cannot afford the payments, we need to consider how much equity he has in the property and whether it is worth it to keep on. I am sorry for the fix he is in.

You might want to check with Legal Aid of North Carolina, if you actually need representation in a case; this website is limited to us answering questions for you and providing general legal information to help you get started on your legal issue.Since you are in Catawba County, you might be able to get someone at the ### office of ### to assist you for short-term legal representation in a small claims case if you need to sue someone for damaged property.  The link to the ### regional offices is at this link: ###Also, if ### is not able to represent you, you can sue in small claims without a lawyer if you desire.  It only costs $96.### (you simply fill out the form provided to you at the Clerk of Superior Court's office at the local courthouse), and $### Office.  Small claims court allows non-lawyers and regular people to file and pursue cases for up to $10,000--with or without a lawyer.  Your court date is usually available within two to three weeks after you file.  This would likely be quite manageable for you even if you cannot afford a lawyer, or ### is unable to provide you a free one.Keep in mind that if you file by yourself, you need to file in the county where the defendant lives, since that is the county where you will need the Sheriff should you win, get a judgment, and then need to serve that judgment and execute it against the defendant's assets.  (North Carolina law requires that when an individual has a judgment entered against him/her that a Notice to Claim Exempt Property" be served along with the copy of the judgment which the defendant can then fill out and return.  At that point you and the Sheriff can coordinate as the Sheriff attempts to seize property to pay the judgment.

If you have a valid judgment and the Sheriff is at least willing to cooperate with you, I would try really hard to either accommodate the ### date, or press hard for the Sheriff to demand an alternative day from the judgment debtor.  If you sue, you can likely win in small claims court (at least up to $10,000), but you will be at the same place all over again since the most you will get is a judgment, which you then have to try to serve and execute just like this time.  I would really try to get the Sheriff to wrap this up as soon as possible, without the judgment debtor stonewalling this further.Best wishes again,43861.0027777778 i am disable an a veteran on a fixed income will you provide legal representation for help getting moneys for my missing an damaged property.including a camper that my name is on title,###? 43859.9895833333 ###,I'm sorry to hear this. See statute for an HOA foreclosure - Â§ 47F-3-116. Lien for sums due the association; enforcement. Link - https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/ByChapter/Chapter_45.html.Pay specific attention to section (f), which gives them the power of sale to foreclose and re-sell home. Section (e) contains information regarding their requirements of notice (which you said may not have been fulfilled). My recommendation is to review the statute and see if there is anything they have not complied with. You could argue this with them to lower the cost and settle before your court date. Is your court date with the clerk of court in superior court? Unfortunately, with the court date scheduled, you are pretty far along and settlement is likely your best option (ie payment plan). Lastly, the firm you are likely speaking with is probably just a trustee." So they are technically a neutral party and do not represent the HOA. If your date does come around you will likely be able to get a continuance for good cause. Simply explain your are gathering the funds negotiating with the HOA or preparing to sell certain assets (or even your home) to pay them off and avoid the foreclosure. Good luck and let me know what other questions you may have. ### ### "43861.9305555556 my home owners association has obtained a lein and are in the process of foreclosure on my home.

Also she said she would send me an email about the pay arrangement but did not so I question if the initial letter was sent as they stated.43861.775 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  I am quite sympathetic to your point of view, as I have similar physical reactions to inhaling ###ette and ### smoke, even if secondhand.  Ultimately, this is going to require the landlord to enforce the lease's non-smoking provisions, so adding a little pressure on her to do so is probably your best option at this moment in time.  You could hire a lawyer to send the landlord a letter of warning that if she does not immediately enforce the non-smoking rule against your ### neighbor, that you will interpret this as a constructive eviction (due to its violating your right to quiet enjoyment) and will move out without paying further rent.  NOTE: If you decide to use the constructive eviction strategy, please be sure that you confirm with a lawyer sending the letter for you first, for this specific reason: constructive eviction has the advantage of allowing a tenant to move out and not pay rent, but in doing so, the tenant is taking the gamble that is the landlord decides to sue, that the magistrate will agree at trial in small claims court that the tenant was indeed constructively evicted.  If that is so, the tenant will not be penalized for not paying rent.  If the magistrate disagrees, the tenant will have to pay the landlord back rent, and will have a judgment entered against him/her.  Since the general rule under the NC Landlord-Tenant Act is that a tenant cannot unilaterally withhold rent without a court order, you have to be certain based on specific legal advice that simply moving out and not paying rent will work under a constructive eviction theory.  It is a risk, so just be aware of that if you try it.Hiring a local landlord-tenant lawyer to send the demand letter to the landlord should not cost you that much--probably $### $###.  If that is beyond your means, you can consult with your closest Legal Aid of NC office and see if they can help you.  I have included a link to the offices' contact information below, and would suggest that you contact either the ### or Greensboro offices, since they appear to be the closest to you in Thomasville.###I sure hope you can get this situation taken care of soon, and permanently.

It's not easy to move out. I have to be spending my time looking around... I plan to not pay the last month rent and spend my deposit money as last month. That woman broke her words several times and wasted my times and money since I moved in. I won't type up the details about those. I know she's deliberately ignoring my calls, emails, and text messages. I find that behavior very disgusting and dishonest. She said she lost my rent check several months ago.

What are my legal options to do something about this? My coughing and missing sleeps get worse these foul drug smells are killing me..."43862.8895833333 Thank you so much, ###.  God bless you and your family as well.Your relief would be one of two things--either (###) to compel the landlord to honor the contract, or (###) to be released from the contract as tenant, altogether.  Option (###) is more viable in small claims court, since small claims magistrates have almost no authority to provide injunctive relief to plaintiffs, although District Court judges do have such power.  Filing in District Court would require you to draft your own complaint and pay $### $96 (the $###-of-process fee would remain the same, through the Sheriff's Office).I am not sure that you would recover much in damages.  You might get modest monetary damages for property damage due to smoke, but you would have to show actual damage.  Your key form of relief is getting out of the place, rather than making the landlord pay you money.If you have actual proof of physical ailments that are supported by doctor's visits and medical records, you would have not only a lawsuit to be released from the rental contract, but a personal injury claim as well, which could raise the amount of money you could get.  HOWEVER, if you want to pursue that, you DEFINITELY need a lawyer, since we are moving away from simple landlord-tenant contract questions, to tort and personal injury law, which you cannot handle on your own without legal training.  If you have enough evidence to show that you have suffered substantial physical harm, I would consult locally with a personal injury lawyer.  Many of these lawyers will offer an initial consultation of ### ###.Hope that helps.  Take care.43864.1472222222 Thanks. What would be the dollar amount I should sue her?

However, if you do not have equity in the house.  If the mortgage is a large as the value of the house, you should focus on your credit.  Let the house go into foreclosure and consult an attorney about repairing your credit.  If everything else is good on your report, you should not have an impossible task to get loans for your children's education.  The effect of a foreclosure on your credit and the way lenders look at it diminishes over time and goes away completely after ten years, as long as you do not pay any partial payments or do anything to extend the reporting period.43864.6645833333 Thank you for getting back with me.

You and the tenant have both been swindled and it will be a difficult matter to balance fairness to both of you.  If you signed a contract for ###d with the company that was using your house, there is not a simple way to void it just based on nonpayment.  A rent to own sounds like another ### for what we usually call a contract for ###d.  The ### company got an ownership interest that puts you in the position of a mortgagee or lender.  So, you would need to do something like a foreclosure to get your house back; an eviction is not sufficient.You are facing two issues  if your mortgage is foreclosed -- the damage to your credit rating and the loss of any equity you may have.  Look carefully at the mortgage balance and the value of the house.  How does that number compare to the cost of attorneys fees to straighten this out?  As far as credit for college expenses, you may consider consulting with one of the companies that advises families about how to obtain scholarships and loans to fund education expenses.  That is a complex field and there may be more issues and opportunities than you presently know are out there.I am sorry I cannot offer you an easy answer.  You are not ### the fact that this is tough and puzzling.  I wish you the best of luck in figuring it out.### ###43864.6118055556 First thing is to look at your ###d.  If you and your husband bought this house while you were married, you probably own this house as a married couple.  This is called tenants by the entireties and it means that the property is not subject to the debts of just one of you.  So, if you were the only one that contracted for the work, he cannot automatically enforce a lien on your husband's interest in the house.He could claim perhaps that the roof gave him a benefit, but that is weak.  But your arguments about the lien only help in contesting the lien.  He still has an action against your for nonpayment.  Why did you not pay for the roof?  Is there a problem with it?  If so, it sounds as if you should show up at the hearing with a copy of your ###d and some good information about why you are not paying.  There is no simple form for you to file.  You will need to go in person and argue your case if you cannot get a lawyer to do it for you.If the work was faulty, you should get some information to present about that.Good luck with this,### ###43864.6173611111 I had a roofing contractor file a lien against my home and then file to force foreclosure.

If the person promised to make a gift of the mobile home, and the mobile was not ### in the name of the donee (i.e., the one receiving the gift), a strong legal argument can be made that the gift was not perfected" to the extent to be effective.  If the gift were actually completed the mobile home itself could not be charged for rent although the land certainly could.  If your uncle never had title to the home he of course cannot legally charge rent for what he does not control as the owner; that decision would be for whoever actually owns the home.  If the donee somehow gets clear title to the home no rent can be charged except for the land on which the mobile home sits.Best wishes to you in ###."43866.1666666667 I have a uncle that gifted a mobile home to his father and he told him that he wouldn't be required to pay anything for it. But years later he is charging my is father rent for the mobile home that is on his fathers land. The mobile home was a gift but the land is his fathers. Does he have the right to charge him for the mobile home now?? And also I don't think my uncle even has the title for the mobile home. So should he get the title so he can't charge him for it?43866.1020833333 I see.  Obviously there is some family drama and jealousy that has influenced this.  This will probably require a lawyer working on this with you directly, in order to clear this up for good.  It would be highly beneficial if there were some contract or other written proof of the gift--especially in the absence of a title to the mobile home.  If any family members who share in common a desire to resolve this situation can come up with several hundred bucks, I would suggest that you hire a local lawyer who practices real estate and contracts to look at this more closely and work something out.  If that is not a possibility, financially speaking, you can contact the closest office of Legal Aid of North Carolina (probably Concord, but check the link below to see all the office listings).  See below:###God bless all of you this new year.43866.6847222222 The reason why he started charging is father is because his father moved on since his wife died. The land is entitled to his father but the mobile home was gifted to him free of charged years ago. But when his father found a new lover he started conflict with him and telling him that the new lover has to leave or he is taking the house from him. I feel that is invading his privacy and love life and threatening to take something from him that he gave him for free. Because I have mulitply family witnesses that can say that he gave him the mobile home for free years ago.43866.5826388889 Good evening, Ms. Maina:Thank you for posting this question.  I am sorry you are in this situation, and I hope that whatever may ensue in the coming two weeks or so, that you can smoothly transition to a better living situation and maintain yourself well.  I certainly hope and pray so.Assuming the landlord has gotten a judgment against you (which will eventually happen since the landlord has refused payments), you would have ten (10) days to appeal, after which the landlord's rights become fixed if you either lose the appeal, or do not appeal at all.  Once you and the landlord have received copies of the judgment, the landlord can go to the Sheriff's office and pay for a Writ of Possession, which, once filed, will be posted on your door within about ###, then executed against you by the date and day (usually within three to five days after posting on your door).  So if you have not received an order yet, or if you have not yet seen a Notice of Writ posted to your door, it will likely be almost a week--at the very least--before you are formally evicted" in the sense that a deputy sheriff locks you out of your place and denies you access permanently.The only way to avoid eviction is to pay the court all amounts due PLUS court costs/fees BEFORE ENTRY OF JUDGMENT.  If you do so before such time the magistrate is required under statute to dismiss the lawsuit entirely and your rights as a tenant remain as before until your lease expires.  If judgment has already been entered there is nothing further that you can do to prevent the eviction if the landlord is not otherwise willing to work with you to avoid the Writ being executed.Blessings and divine strength to you as you work through these challenges.  I hope you come out in good shape either way.  Be well this new year."43868.2118055556 Last month i got a letter to go to court on the 18th ###  for non payment of rent since ### . I went to court and the judge advised reaching an agreement with the rental property since i had partial payment. The rental property refused and wanted the whole amount. Yesterday 2/5 ( last day to pay rent before a late fee) i went to pay for the total rent of dec, ### and feb but they refused payment because the filed for eviction on ###th. They said the sheriff should be coming for lock out around wed next week because the sheriffs office was busy and it takes about ###. Is there anything i can do to avoid eviction ? If not what can o do to avoid having an eviction in my background check?Note: since court i have not received any kind of paperwork or notice on my door or in the mail about the matter . Thankyou for your time43867.6875 Since they filed on the 29th i have not received any kind of paperwork.  When i tries to pay off the whole amount they refused to even tell me how much i owed. They asked for a forwarding address instead. Does this mean i still have time to file a motion and or pay it off in the court or am i out of time for that and would rather start looking for something else?Also, if i vacate before the sheriff shows up, will it make a difference?Thank you so much43868.2173611111 You are very welcome, Madam.  If there is no judgment for this lawsuit, you still can pay the Clerk the total sums due, plus court costs.  Check with the Clerk's office first to see whether a judgment has been filed first in the case under the number assigned to it.  If not, tell the Clerk that you wish to pay all fees, rents and costs in order to have the magistrate dismiss the lawsuit.  If there is a judgment, it is too late to exercise that option.Assuming it is too late to avoid the eviction, I certainly would vacate before the deputy sheriff executes, and also take your belongings with you, as it will be hard to get them back after the premises are padlocked.  It will also spare you the embarrassment of this taking place in the presence of other neighbors.  Fortunately, the initial notice of the writ would tell you the day, date and time at which the landlord and the deputy will return to execute the writ.43868.2416666667 Certainly.  Be well.43870.0611111111 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  You can probably break the lease if you need to, but be aware that in doing so, you will likely have to pay an early termination or buyout" fee before the landlord agrees to release you from any further obligations under the current lease.  I would check your lease agreement to see if there are any provisions about early termination and what ### are due.  If there are those provisions will apply in your situation unless you and the landlord come to an alternate understanding that is in writing signed and supported by consideration.If there is no lease provision that spells this out with any certainty I would approach the landlord anyway and try to work out some compromise whereby you pay some money to the landlord to make the landlord whole in exchange for his/her letting you out of the lease.  Remember that if there is a written lease any modification of the arrangement needs to also be in writing.Generally speaking a small claims court will allow a magistrate to charge at least two (###) months' rent following the tenant's early termination if some agreement is not otherwise worked out or if the lease does not specify contingencies relating to early termination.  The reason for this is that landlords often need at least two (###) months to find a suitable tenant willing to pay the same rental installment amount as the prior tenant.  In North Carolina a residential landlord has a statutory duty to mitigate damage by employing due diligence and best efforts to find a suitable alternative tenant as soon as possible.  But hopefully you and the landlord can work something out so that the landlord does not even have to think about suing in small claims court for rent not paid should you vacate early.I hope this transition will work out smoothly and I send you my prayers and best wishes as you work through health challenges.

Unfortunately, it sounds like your landlord will not do anything unless a lawyer gets involved. I would save all the evidence you have and make an appointment with NC State's Student Legal Services. If all four of you are NC State students, part of your tuition goes to this program that helps students like you with Landlord-Tenant issues. If they take your case, they would be able to contact your landlord on your behalf and take the appropriate steps from there.If you four are all not NC State students, please let me know and I can provide you with further advice.

It seems to be a difficult situation. To clarify a few basic pointers. You have made all the payments and completed your payment schedule? Once completed you requested the deed at the end of your payment schedule? The deed would contain the restrictions you say were requested. Let's start with the history of your property. Then get into the agreements you have. Can you provide:All parties involved? ie ### and ### have a small business that provides mortgages? Your name as it would appear on the documents you signed for your home/property?The address of your property? This appears relatively lengthy in history and taking it one step at a time will paint the clearest picture. ### ###43880.7881944444 Got it, I believe I am up to speed on your property history. As you mentioned, there is no satisfaction of the deed of trust on record. Additionally, according to page ### ### of your Deed of Trust (bk 2558, ### ###) they may" cancel the deed on record. These documents are certainly a product of the recessions mortgage crises. Several thoughts. Without checking into any statute of limitations (timing restrictions to bring a suite) you could sue for everything you mentioned. However that is expensive. For instance I will not agree to bringing a full blow lawsuit for less than $10000. However you are correct that getting the deed of trust cancelled on record and your original deed released back to you is important for selling gifting estate planning etc. What was the last contact you had with the company and what was their exact response? ###"43885.8868055556 I do have all of my receipts.

I cannot afford an attorney's rates but I desperately want my property deed. What can I do? Do I have grounds to sue them for their mortgage lending practices consumer deceit (property restrictions are not being honored)  and even pain and suffering (filing bankruptcy or the anxiety it has caused).

Has ### taken any further actions? You are not in collections, correct? If you want to really force them to produce said documentation and file the paperwork showing your deed of trust has been paid off, the next step would likely be a motion in court where a judge would sign off on requiring them to fulfill said acts. ### 43888.6180555556 Certainly.  God bless you.43882.0541666667 Good evening, Mr. Berg:Thank you for your question.  There is a lot to unpack here, although the actual legal issues are few and quite simple.  My brief responses are as follows:First, your legal remedy to the extent you wish to pursue one, is to sue the property for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, codified at N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-42.  A link to the statutory provision is below:https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_42/gs_42-42.htmlLook carefully at Â§ 42-42(a)(2) and Â§ 42-42(a)(8)(i) and (l).  The landlord must cure the habitability defect within a reasonable time" after having "actual knowledge" of the problem.  Your remedy would be rent abatement which is a rental discount for the prorated period in which the habitability defect went unaddressed despite the landlord's actual knowledge of the problem.  This would result in a modest judgment amount being entered against the landlord should you win in front of the small claims magistrate.It costs $96.### and $30.###.  The forms for the Complaint and the Alias and Pluries Summons are available at the Clerk of Superior Court's office at the courthouse.  Usually you can get a court date within two weeks of filing and the actual hearing would normally not last longer than a half hour or hour at most.  You will be called to the well of the court based on the order in which your case falls on the docket list.If you do not wish to go the litigation route you can complain to the code enforcement office of either Mecklenburg County or the City of Charlotte (depending on where you live or one of the town governments if you live within the incorporated limits of a town/city other than Charlotte) and ask for them to come out and investigate.  They might fine your landlord depending on the extent of violations as found in the investigation.The retractions really have no legal weight to them unless there is an actual agreement between you and the landlord for a written retraction.  The mere promise of one without being part of a larger deal is not enforceable even if it is morally the right thing to do.The property can deny you a renewal for any reason as long as it is not discriminatory under federal law--i.e. based on race color national origin sex religion disability or age if over 40.  Retaliation only comes to play if the landlord actually files for eviction based on your engaging in a legally protected activity--such as reporting a habitability violation to the code enforcement authorities or demanding that the landlord uphold its responsibilities under the North Carolina Landlord-Tenant Act (N.C.G.S. Chapter 42).Finally as to any possible recordings they are legal so long as the party recording it was a party to the conversation and not an outside third party.Hope this helps you as you weigh and consider your options.  I do hope this situation can soon be resolved.  Blessings and best wishes to you in 2020."43881.9805555556 I had a flood in my apt due to broken plumbing of my kitchen sink. The prop mgmt co (Poplar ### Apts, ###, PK Prop Mgmt) did not respond to their office 24-hr emergency number" for FOURTEEN HOURS.The plumber who was called couldn't open the drain since it had collapsed. He left me his wet-dry vac to suck out the sewage water from my sinks (coming from the apt above) and empty the vac outside or in my toilet. The entire flood could've been avoided had the mgmt responded and a plumber been called when I called the mgmt 24-hr emergency number.The mgmt co didn't begin repairs for TEN DAYS leaving me to suck sewage from my sink into a leaking shop vac and emptying it all day and all hours of the night... again for TEN DAYS.(BTW I still have a hole in my bathroom wall and the flooring that was torn up has not been replaced after a month and a half... see attached pic.)After the plumbing was finally repaired I was delivered a letter full of defacatory nonsense 100% LIES and projection blaming ME for their gross incompetence and specifically the VERY things THEY did wrong even threatening me with eviction.Through a "service coordinator" (who has a separate on-site office but works for PK Mgmt and I was referred to in the letter) I demanded a written retraction of ALL the accusations with an apology. He never got back to me as he promised but I finally got thru to their office three weeks later and he said he would set up a meeting with the prop mgmt (who authored the letter).We finally had that meeting Tues 2-18. The mgr ### an  apology I told her I wanted it in writing along with a retraction of everything which I was accused in her letter to which she agreed.Just before she left she tried to say something about giving me the retraction with my lease renewal which is set up for Fri 1-21 mumbling some implication about I wouldn't pursue anything further and tying it to the renewed lease. I didn't agree when this was brought up. She tried to ### my words then said to the two service coordinator people "You heard him" and ran out.Now I'm finally getting to the actual legal question.... This retraction is not conditional and it's a separate matter from the lease. Can she try to tie the two together? Can she deny the lease renewal if I don't sign something restricting any action I might take in the future? (She's obviously scared she might lose her crummy little job.)Second I think the meeting may have been recorded WITHOUT MY PERMISSION OR KNOWLEDGE. Can anything be used as a legal binding contract in that recording especially if taken out of context?Thanks in advance for your help. Feel free to call me anytime for more details.### ######"43881.8916666667 OK, thanks again for all your help and advice.-###43882.0534722222 Thanks so much for your quick reply, and the possible legal ramifications for their horrid incompetence. (BTW, this property is a senior, low-income, sec ### apartment complex. I don't think that changes anything in terms of the law, but I forgot to mention it.)My question is, can she demand I sign some sort of agreement to NOT pursue any further actions (like those  you mentioned) in exchange for her written retraction & apology (it proves the accusations were 100% false by her own admission), or even deny my lease renewal if I refuse to agree to NOT pursue any future action?Second, if the recording of the meeting was made by another PK employee... a handyman/maintenance guy who showed up very timely to fix the door latch" right when the meeting began and till the end... but wasn't a party to the conversation it was none of his business. Would that still be legal?Thanks again you're a tremendous help!### ######"43882.0395833333 You are welcome, Mr. ###.  I agree that North Carolina law's remedies when it comes to breach of the implied warranty of habitability do not change as a result of this being a Section ###; HOWEVER, you will also need to search on U.S. HUD's website to see what remedies or complaints you can seek through the federal government's process, which I am not very familiar with since I do not handle cases involving Section ###.  I am sure there is helpful information on HUD's website that could be of further use to you, especially if you wish to avoid the litigation route of redressability.I think you are placing too much weight on the property's allegations and the desired retraction of the same, which I consider to be a red ### in terms of the law.  You can be refused a renewal for any reason not prohibited under federal housing discrimination laws anyway, so it does not really matter what the reason for denying you is, short of that illegal threshold.If the person was in the room when the conversation took place, that is legal under the North Carolina ### consent rule.Focus more on getting the habitability problems ironed out, and less time on the retraction, which is a waste of time.Best regards.43882.0451388889 Good Saturday afternoon to you, Shavonndra:Thank you for this question.  Really this depends on two factors: (###) whether your father has a valid sublease agreement with the other occupants (including yourself), and (###) whether your landlord approved of any sublease agreement or rights of possession by designated occupants" other than the primary tenants.  Many leases indicate under what circumstances if any a tenant can sublease the premises to subtenants; usually if this right is afforded by the landlord at all there is a requirement that the ### be pre-cleared with the landlord in writing.  If the lease that your father has with the landlord does not specify one way or the other you may need to seek the landlord's intervention before moving to a formal eviction proceeding.  What will make this tricky is that since your father is the only remaining primary tenant only he has the right to evict a subtenant unless the landlord is willing to exercise that right alongside your father or in your father's stead.The priority of authority to evict ultimately lies with the landlord but if this is a legitimate and lawful ### arrangement your father would have to evict the other family members living there during his primary tenancy under the lease.  The biggest mistake here may have been allowing people to live in this rented home without either obtaining the landlord's written permission or at least having the family members added to the lease.  If the people who agreed to split rent in your father's absence were not part of either the lease or a sublease I doubt that any rights of enforcement can be pursued against those individuals with respect to those sums.Wish I had better news but if this matter ever comes in front of a small claims magistrate in an eviction case this is likely what is going to be the outline of issues that the magistrate will be most interested in knowing before making a decision.  This situation appears to be quite messy and will be hard to sort through if there are no written confirmations of the arrangements you describe.Best regards."43883.6923611111 On the lease is my father (and mother before she past). Living here was myself, my mother, my daughter and my aunt. My father lives in va. My mom past last August. Me and my aunt decided to stay and split the bills. My aunt asked if her goddaughter (her ex's daughter)  could move in. I agreed to that. She told me she was trying to get guardianship of her. Her father brought her but never left. 1st it was to get her registered at school. Then it was to wait for the 2nd meeting with the case worker. It's been about ###-###. And I asked him to leave. Him and my aunt say it requires an eviction. We never came to agreement to split things ###. If he gives money I dont see it. Can I kick him out?43883.6493055556 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  If you are a tenant or a subtenant, you have the right to invite whatever guests to your rented home, unless there is a lease agreement between you and the landlord or ### that states otherwise.  If your guests follow all lease requirements and otherwise are not causing problems, disturbing the peace or violating the law, there is nothing to prevent them from visiting you, legally speaking.  You can warn the landlord or ### (whoever is causing these problems unnecessarily) that you will retain counsel and take legal action if this continues, and that you will consider legal action if they call the cops by making frivolous complaints that are not justified by the facts or the applicable lease agreement.If needed, you can contact local law enforcement and warn them of the landlord or ###'s frivolous complaints in advance, and even show them a copy of the lease agreement in order to prevent this from becoming an issue in the future.  You can also either retain a local lawyer in ### County to send both the landlord and ### a legal advisory letter about your rights, or reach out to Legal Aid of North Carolina if paying a local lawyer a couple hundred dollars to do this is a problem.  See the link below to the regional offices of ###:###If you utilize this link, scroll down until you see the contact information for the ### office, which services ### County among others nearby in your local area.  If they cannot take your case and send letters of warning to the landlord and ###, a local lawyer in town could probably do this for anywhere between $### $250.I hope this helps, and that this situation will be resolved very soon, for the betterment of your quality of life, and peace of mind.  Be well in ###!43883.85 Hello, I have an inquiry about someone(who was invited) having the possibility of being charged with trespassing even though I have invited them over. The primarily lease holders say they will call the cops on them if they come on to the property again. They're also Jehovah witnesses which I have allowed to come over for a few months without protest until recently. I am also blind(my son is typing for me) and they are a way for me to get to church and do grocery shopping. I have asked for them to come over beforehand and allowed them to come over every weekend with very open arms. They are my friends and I feel like the primary lease holders are doing this out of spite because of other issues that have popped up. 43883.7194444444 I am totally not clear on whether the plumber has concluded that the fault is in a limited common area or if a unit owner has a problem that is affecting you.  The answer to that determines how you proceed.  I think you need to try to get a meeting with all the affected owners and the Board to look at the ### report, the map of the common and limited common areas around and under your building, and perhaps look at the declaration documents to see if anything there helps clarify.  The reference to those documents will be in your deed (usually on-line) and then you can look up the book and page of the declaration on-line.this is pretty technical legal and plumbing stuff -- I have no idea what a belly" might mean. Is it a design flaw in the construction? Is it something that broke.  Is the pipe part of a unit or is it part of the communal pipes that take the waste water away from the building into the bigger system?"43889.6527777778 I purchased my townhome ### ###  sewer ###. The sewer ### come out through the downstairs shower drain and and it affects most if not all the units in my building. Cam the association oproperty manage group says they are not responsible for  the plumbing issue. However,  I hired  A professional plumber who found a belly in the pipes that has 10' of standing water and it's underneath the concrete slab of another units building.My question is, who is responsible for  the plumbing in this situation?43888.3909722222 Thank you very much for replying back.In regards to the plumber, he did provide a solution. And is also willing to speak with anyone from ###or board members and share his finding along with his opinion on how to solve it. And so have his statement along pictures that he took with his camera. And I happened to just come home from our ###annually meeting not to long ago. And you are absolutely right about them not claiming responsibility of the problem.  They are pinning the responsibility on the owner of the unit where the ' belly' was found. And as of right now the board is inactive.  So does that change anything  you advised?43889.1520833333 This is a frustrating, smelly situation, and not easily fixed.  I think a realistic view of the motivations of everyone and the science of the problem are the best keys to the solution.  It sounds as if your plumber has determined that this problem originates in a common area. The management company is going to take the cost effective view whenever there is any ambiguity.  So, you need to think about how to bring effective pressure to bear on this. First try to get all the owners who are affected to band together to make a fuss.  Then get your plumber on board to tell the Management Company and the Board that the problem is in the common area.  You also need his expert opinion on the proper solution.  How will this problem be fixed-fully and permanently-not your opinion but an expert's advice.  Then take all this to the homeowners board.  They are more likely to be responsive to homeowners than the management company.  The trick is to bring them objective evidence of a problem and a proposed solution. If they balk, ask them to hire their own expert for advice on the source and solution.Good luck with this.### ###43888.6125 In a situation like this, you should look at practical realities -- How would they force you to give them the money to secure a contract you decided not to go through with.  It would likely cost more to hire an attorney to push the issue than they would recover.  Then, think about the equities.  The due diligence fee is intended to pay the seller for having the house off of the market for a time.  It looks as if you backed out almost before the Sellers accepted your offer.  Was the house off of the market long enough to justify this much money?  What have they lost for less than ###. If you found your agent shifty, you might reasonably conclude that the agent is asking for you to pay the due diligence fee because there was an agreement that the agents would get a share. To forestall this, consider writing back to say that you were not confident of the professionalism and honesty of the brokerage firm and that is why you backed off.  This lets the agent know that your next step is to list the shifty behavior in a complaint to the real estate commission.  But, be very careful of your facts -- you must be able to list objective specific items that gave you concern.I think it is not too likely that this will go beyond some demands and angry words.  But it is still concerning.  I hope it quiets down soon so you can move ahead to find a more suitable home.### ###43892.7902777778 We put an offer down on a house and signed a contract to purchase and to pay $###  due diligence and $###. There were a lot of red flags and our buyer's agent was being extremely shifty. We were uncomfortable moving forward and emailed our buyers agent the next day to terminate the contract. We never handed over a due diligence check or an earnest check and the contract is now terminated. The buyers agent is now, ###, asking us to give them a due diligence check, to give to the sellers. Do we have to? It says in the contract that if we don't pay it within ###.  Is there anything they can do to us to make us pay it?43889.6805555556 Is the landlord liable for property damages and medical expenses, caused by building ###, they knew about and refused to fix?We noticed mold growth and a waterlogged carpet in our rented apartment. Complex management was notified, who sent maintenance over. They told us that the mold was harmless and that we had caused it by not fully opening the blinds. They then cleaned the mold off the windows and told us they would be back to deal with anything else that needs doing. The extensive mold on the walls and on our property were not addressed, nor was the waterlogged carpet, we assumed this would be dealt with when they came back, however they never did. Maintenance did file a fraudulent report online, relating to these issues, omitting the more serious problems, by only stating their was moisture around the windows they had dried and the job was complete.We contacted management again and asked to be moved, the only option given was the apartment next door. Due to its close proximity, we asked if it has a history of mold, but never heard from them again.We then hired a mold inspector, who tested the air, took samples and found the cause. His report concluded the issues were caused by building ###, such as cracks in the windows and a inadequate drainage system. There were significant elevations of mold and fungi in the air.Due to the increasing property damage and health issues, we believed the unit was no longer fit for habitation and informed management of our intentions to move because of this, however they did not respond. We contacted them again and was threatened with a financial penalty for breaking the lease and told that we had caused the mold. We then provided then with the inspectors report that, showing the true cause, also providing a remedy, which included hiring specialists trained in this area, however, we never heard back. We tried to salvage what we could and document the damage caused in the unit, because we didn't want to cross contaminate our new home and are worried they will dispose of our property. But its extremely difficult due to the health related issues it causes's, so much so, I ended up in the emergency room, with flu like symptoms. Based on the tests done at the hospital, I was diagnosed with health related problems ,due to the mold exposure and provided with a treatment.I was told to try and avoid the mold, but because its all over most of our belongings, I feel like its a catch ###. I don't know what to do as we have listed funds and the property damage could be over $80KRenters Insurance has denied coverage and won't come back out to the property, even though there is further damage caused by other factors not found at the time, mentioned in the inspectors report.Any help or advice would be very much appreciated.43892.91875 Mr. Fletcher:Thanks so much for posting this detailed, informative fact summary of this unfortunate situation.  I think your routes of redress are threefold, depending on what you wish to do.FIRST, you can sue the landlord in small claims court for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, codified at N.C.G.S. Â§ 42-42.  The specific provisions at play here are Â§ 42-42(a)(2), and Â§ 42-42(a)(8)(l).  See the link to the statute here:https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_42/gs_42-42.htmlIf you sue in small claims court, the remedy you would seek is rent abatement which is calculated as the diminished fair rental value of the premises during the period in which the defects went unaddressed (or were insufficiently addressed) despite the landlord's having both (1) actual knowledge of the problem and (2) a reasonable time to cure the defects in question.  The small claims magistrate will have broad discretion to decide what that monetary amount will be, although you can request an amount in the complaint.  (Fee to file complaint is $96, and the service of process fee through the Sheriff is $30.)  On top of rent abatement damages, you can recover special" and "consequential" damages such as incidental costs and harm that were caused as a result of the mold.  The main caveat here is that small claims cases are limited to $100 so you have to be realistic and within that threshold in order to get the magistrate to your side.  Use photographic evidence as well as sworn testimony on the day of the trial and the environmental analysis you independently commissioned (so glad you thought to do this beforehand which credits you).  You can also as part of the lawsuit ask the magistrate to release you early from the lease agreement by a certain effective date you can request.  Otherwise be wary of withholding rent without the landlord's consent since in NC a tenant cannot unilaterally withhold rent without a court order.SECOND you can report your landlord to the code/health enforcement agency of your local government--whether that be with Buncombe County government the City of Asheville or the appropriate county/municipal authority (you may need to do a little searching online and make a couple calls but I am sure someone in county or city/town government can point you towards the right person).  The authorities can come out inspect your unit and if necessary assess fines and penalties against your landlord.THIRD if you have suffered serious medical injuries you might also consider consulting with a local personal injury lawyer to see if you should either combine your rent abatement claim with a personal injury claim into one lawsuit or pursue them separately with you handling the small claims case for rent abatement and your personal injury lawyer seeking a settlement for your medical costs.That is how I would approach the situation from one of or a combination of all the above strategies.  I hope this situation greatly improves very soon.  You have been through a great deal.  All the best to you this spring."43893.2770833333 Good afternoon, Ms. Richburg:The only thing you can do to prevent a Writ of Possession is to contact the landlord and explain why you could not appear.  It is totally up to the landlord, once the judgment has been entered, and the appeals period has passed, as to whether a Writ is then processed.  It is the landlord that pays the $###.  Once the landlord does this, the Sheriff is obligated to execute the Writ, unless the landlord for some reason asks for a delay or cancellation.  At this point, whether you are removed because of a Writ is 100% up to what the landlord wishes to do.If you and the landlord do not work out something, the Writ will be executed.  I wish I could offer something more pleasing, but this is the truth based on my experience with similar landlord-tenant matters.I hope something can be worked out in the next ###.  Blessings and best wishes to you this spring.43893.7118055556 I was facing eviction and appealed the case to try to arrange a pay and stay but I was hospitalized yesterday due to my ### at the time of the appeal hearing. A writ of possession has not be entered as of yet and I would like to know what is the best way to proceed to get my hearing rescheduled since I was hospitalized and have my discharge papers and to avoid being removed from my home until the new hearing date?43893.6777777778 Absolutely.  Hope everything goes well.  Take care, and enjoy your Sunday tomorrow.43898.16875 Back in July of ###, I let a woman that my brother was dating store her personal belongings in my utility building. In September of ###, I typed a letter stating that she had ###. We both signed and dated the letter but it was not notorized. My last communication with her was about a month ago. She just keeps telling me she will get them out soon. I need my building to store new lawn equipment in that I recently purchased. My question ### I have the right to dispose of her items?43896.8944444444 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  As a ### County native, I always enjoy interacting with ### County folks on this site.  I am of the legal opinion that you have the right to dispose of this person's items as you see fit, based on the terms of the letter/agreement you both signed.  (It does not have to be notarized in order to be legal; notarization is for confirming the ### of the parties who signed.  Notarization is required for wills, powers of attorney, separation agreements, and other similar documents, but not basic contracts, contrary to public perception on that issue.)  As long as you have provided the 30-day minimum window (which you clearly have, if this occurred in ###19), you have met your obligations to the person.  She might make noise about small claims lawsuits and the like, but just keep the letter for a while as evidence to what you two agreed to, just in case.  I see no reason why you are legally required to retain the items any longer.Have a blessed spring in your personal, professional and business affairs.  43897.1319444444 Thank you so much for your prompt response...43898.1680555556 y family has a commercial property with septic tank and drain lines located on neighbors property.

Kind Regards: ### Cannady ###-###----###43897.0145833333 Good morning, Ms. Medley:Thank you for your question.  I agree with the landlord that you need to make a noise complaint to local law enforcement (police if you live inside a town; otherwise, it will be the ### County Sheriff's department if you live outside the incorporated limits of a town).  Hopefully law enforcement will be able to handle the situation if the landlord will not otherwise penalize the tenant under lease provisions governing noise and community rules.

She has stolen my special needs childâ€™s medication and money from my home and when I went to kick her out she would not leave. For the first few months she did pay $### ($300) because she then brought her daughter to live there and because she was over staying our original agreement. She has not paid a dime in the last three months and even has quit her job. The sheriff told me that I could not kick her out and that I would have to evict her and that if I did change my locks that he would make me let her back into my home. The magistrate told me I had to give her a ###, those ### ### of March. This lady has no plans on leaving by the ###. She has brought even more things into my home, has started smoking cigarettes in my daughterâ€™s room, has moved my childâ€™s belongings out of the room and moved hers in the room just in this last week. I am ### that the law protects people like her. Her name is NOT on my lease and she has no bills in her name and she does not pay a dime.  I do not understand why the law is forcing me to continue to support this ladyâ€™s and her daughterâ€™s living expenses. I am a single mother too, so why am I being forced to support her? I also need her out of my home ASAP because her daughter has been aggressive towards my toddler. Her daughter is ### ###. For example: Her kid kicked my kid in the head the other day just because her mother would not let her go play outside. Also, if I am not around the daughter will â€œspankâ€ my daughter. My electric has more than doubled since sheâ€™s been there and is home all day.what is the quickest way I can get this lady out of my home?the magistrate told me that if I cut off my electric while Iâ€™m gone, that she can sue me. Is this true?if I were to change my locks and put her stuff outside on the 13th, can the sheriff make me let her back in?She goes to her BFs house to stay three, Consecutive, nights a week. Can I not say that I â€œthoughtâ€ she moved out during one of her three night stays and change my locks and put her belongings out? Or just change my locks but let her in to get her stuff?can I not keep her out of my home when Iâ€™m not there since sheâ€™s a thief? id like to not be sued43898.0868055556 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  You are going to have to evict this person by filing a Complaint for Summary Ejectment with the Clerk of Superior Court at the ### County Courthouse.  The filing fee is $96, and the service of process fee through the Sheriff's Office is $30.  On the complaint, you will see four (###) boxes that you can check for the reason for evicting.  I believe, based on your facts in this posting, that at least two (###) apply: first, holdover status (since the ### stayed beyond the period of your notice to her to quit), and second, illegal activity on the premises (since she stole property from you and your family).  On the date of your court appearance, carefully present your case to the magistrate (you can appear without a lawyer), and show the ### notice that you sent.  Anything that you wish to present as evidence to the magistrate should be brought with you, and you should be prepared to testify under oath, in live court, as to the timeline of events leading to your demand for her to vacate your residence.  Most likely, the magistrate will enter a judgment of possession against the ###, and she will have ten (10) days to appeal the judgment.  If she fails to do so, or if she does so, but loses, you will then be vested in your rights to possession, and can change the locks if necessary.  HOWEVER, as the Sheriff's department has already warned, you should not make any effort to block her access to the premises until you have vested rights after the appeal period.  You may even wish to ask the Sheriff's Office whether it will require you to obtain a Writ of Possession (cost, $55), before you take final steps to exclude the ### permanently, just to be on the safe side in case she threatens to sue for illegal eviction (not really credible, but she could always say that if she knows a little landlord-tenant law; this would be a way to protect yourself).This is the way to legally move forward if you want to ensure that you do not accidentally incur liability that can be asserted against you in court.  Note also that you cannot cut off electricity or any other utilities that the ### otherwise relies upon when staying at your residence.Best wishes to you and your family this spring.43898.1986111111 Honestly, I do not know since I do not practice criminal law.  I know for sure that this is an illegal eviction, but as to what criminal consequences might ensue, I am not sure.  I think, at minimum, that the Sheriff could come and forcibly allow the ### back in until further notice (such as a court eviction).  You can ask the court for an expedited eviction based illegal activity if you want, which could possibly speed things up a little.  I would definitely not change the locks without legal authorization.Best wishes, again.43899.9631944444 Thank you for the reply. Can a sheriff arrest me or force me to let her back into my home. At this point I do not care about being sued. The tenant said that the sheriff told her she could break into my room since the breaker box was in my room and I turned the breakers off when I leave the house. So, she broke in. I just want to make sure I canâ€™t get into any criminal trouble for changing my locks and I do not care about being sued at this point. 43899.9548611111 I need help concerning housing.

I had spoke to the maintenance guy briefly on the phone and he told me that he pushes on my door while he is vacuuming around the mat outside. I have very strong suspicion it is him.

The contract says tenants are responsible for the sewer charge but when we sign the contract they did not mentioned about the sewer ### they have paid (we moved from out of state so not familiar with this by that time). We took care of the following ###s responsibly.

When the new lease arrived in September I called the Property Manager and she didnâ€™t answer but I explained the Original lease holder moved out & I was added to the lease last year and I intended on signing the lease and needed her name removed. She called me back and left me a very friendly Message stating that the only thing we need to do was have her call since the lease was Originally with her.

Is it as simple as asking him to choose to return the amount of the deposit over the ###.### ($###) or the Pet Deposit amount ($###000), giving him the option of which he would like to do?

If not, unless there is a grace period in the lease, then you don't get a grace period.  And remember, rent must be in the landlord's possession by the date it is due, not mailed on that date and they receive it on the 1st or later.  The landlord provides a direct deposit way of doing the rent which is usually a good option because you can see when the money was put into their account.  Remember even these electronic payments have a ### in transmission of a few days depending on the exact method.I do not see the required security deposit bank information in the lease.  Did you ever receive a letter from the landlord with the required bank information for your security deposit?  Landlord had ###.  If not, you can request that the security deposit is applied to the rent due to his failure to comply with the Security Deposit Act.  The security deposit does not have to be replenished (the COVID executive order is different and that money has to be put back into security deposit once this is all over).  If you can apply security toward the rent then you will be ahead enough that you should be able to pay before the 1st of the month if you say you can now pay on the 1st of the month.###44105.7375 Your security deposit is too high.  If your rent is ### ###, not 4120.

While I understand that, he is saying that due to this he has no timetable for when he will be able to see the apartment. My questions are can he legally hold my security deposit indefinitely and what are my possible courses of action to obtain my security deposit? Thank you in advance for your assistance.### 44107.8659722222 Your landlord has ###.

In addition, you can find a local attorney that might take the case because the attorney can also possibly be awarded attorney fees paid by the landlord.###44108.1013888889 A co-owned cat was taken without consent by a partner (###) with whom I was in a previous relationship. While custody was not explicitly discussed upon the termination of our relationship, I was the primary caregiver and financial provider for the cat. The adoption papers are also in my name. An agreement was made in writing via text message on ###th with ### that allowed her to take the cat for a weekend, picking him on Friday (Sep. 11) and returning him on Sunday (Sep. 13). The cat was never returned. ### requested that we have a discussion at my apartment at 6:### (Sep. 14) concerning custody, with a third party present, and that the cat would be brought with her. The cat was never brought, nor returned. ### did not follow through with the agreed-upon meeting. It was shortly after this that ### blocked my social media, and I was unable to establish a connection. A police report was filed, and I had been advised not to directly contact anyone involved.On ###th, a mutual friend arranged a meeting between ### and I to discuss what would happen to the catâ€”mainly ownership. We both felt that we were the rightful owners of the cat. A handwritten, signed agreement was made, saying that the cat would be brought to my home on ###th for one week, and that the cat would alternate residences every three weeks. Specific performance on this agreement is still pending, but it seems doubtful that ### will follow through on it.I would like to pursue legal action to have the cat returned to me, and be provided full ownership of itâ€”likely via small claims court or wherever I can testify pro per. As stated above, my name is on the adoption papers, and I am the financial guarantor of all vet bills and food/care. The cat was also listed as a registered pet under my lease. I would assume that that's ample evidence to prove that the cat is my property (I know that is how they are viewed legally). Some time after taking the cat, however, ### registered the animal as an ESA. I'm not sure if that affects anything legallyâ€”I'm told it's only relevant to housing and travel. I've never brought a situation to court, so I'm unsure of next steps. Any help would be appreciated.Thank you!44112.8881944444 You would have to go to family court since this is a relationship Pet custody" dispute.  The Case of Houseman v. Dare decided in ###.Since you have the agreement that is your remedy to enforce or convince the judge to award you "full custody".If you already had the cat before the two of you met and can prove the cat was your prior to your relationship starting you can use that toyour advantage as the cat should be considered your property you possessed prior to the relationship.So unless you want to spend lots of money with an attorney you can try to file on your own but that will cost you filing fees and time to appear in court probably multiple times for first a mediator and if that goes nowhere then a trial.Best thing to do is work it out.  You know here she lives.  Send a certified letter to prove delivery and request she complies with the agreement you both signed or you will file in court.

Also, they're telling everyone if they are planning to stay, they must sign the new lease by ###th.  I was told that if I do not wish to sign the new lease, there would be $###, but then told by someone else that wasn't so, but he said he would clarify and get back to me.  They said they would be replacing all windows and doors which should help with the draft, but renovations would only be done on vacant units and the price for those would be $###200.  The property as it stand right now is not worth it. It is a ### ###. There is an issue of mold.  The buildings are old and need updating.44173.9868055556 I need to see a copy of your lease and need to know your payment history for the past ### (what date did you pay and how much, any late fees that were added, etc.).  If you are not paid in full by the due date the landlord can add late fees if your lease says they can.As far as raising rent, they are permitted if it is the end of your lease or if you re month to month as long as they give the proper notices.  There are other issues that would need to be explored but I need the info I requested first.  Also include copies of all letters you have received or other communications with the old and new landlord about your rent.  You can email it all the the address on the attached business card.###44174.1222222222 I replied to your email.  Please respond there.44176.6875 Good evening,On Monday ###th. I put a Christmas display outside of my condominium door. Today, Tuesday ###th, I received a notice of violation via email for having furniture" outside of my door. The display consisted of a small wooden table (######" tall by ###7" wide by 19" deep surface area of 51###" squared) with a winter scene depicted on top (Small houses ### pine tree figurines lights) and ### "gnomes" home made with a hat on top.. My girlfriend and I are very upset as this year has been very challenging for us not even including everything related to the pandemic and this was the first true holiday that we have been able to truly get excited for and  celebrate since I recovered from spinal surgery acute ### and near liver failure since November of ### ######0.I removed the display as instructed. I have lived here for over ###. Since I have moved in there have been and still are other tables and chairs set up outside of other people's units as well as several other kinds of furniture and belongings including but not limited to: (Photos attached)Table with two chairs (### surface area of ###64###"squared) table (### Surface area of 4778"squared) with plastic lawn chair and ### wooden chair with birdhouse painted on wooden bench drawers with ### bicycle travel cooler cardboard boxes laundry basket ### pot ikea bag full of stuff giant tea kettle(?) Spiderman bike ### corner table chair stool bike with child trailer ###.I know for a fact that some of those items have been there prior to the ###+ years I have been here but I received a notification the day after I put my Christmas display out.I asked to management company if anyone else has received a violation notice today as another persons table and several chairs can be seen from the door of my unit. They have yet to respond.My question is does this constitute grounds for discrimination or any other violation of my rights if I was singled out and notified of a violation that only I received? (I am the only person in the condominium that decorates for holidays). This has really crushed our Christmas spirits in a time when things are already bad enough in this world. I don't have money to ask about this as I have been out of work since my back injury in November of TERM00065###.I truly hope you all have a better Holiday season than I am having at this rate.Please feel free to contact me for any further questions."44174.1777777778 Thank you ###. I did remove the table as I do understand it is a rule. I honestly have no problem with my neighbors having any chairs out or tables out so I'm not going to make a big deal of it. Thank you for the information.44174.8368055556 This is not discrimination.  If anything it is a case of selective enforcement.  The board needs to enforce rules evenly on all properties.  You can bring up the other properties to the board, but you are still required to comply with the rules.  If they try fining you then you can argue that every single one of the other properties you provided must also be fined or no one is fined and get a warning first.  It is your responsibility to know the rules and regulations of your development and the HOA bylaws.###44174.8284722222 Hi! Do I have to register my business in each state that I want to fix and flip/rent out property in? Or can I perform business in any state while only being registered in one?  My company is registered in ### but I would like to rent out properties in SC.Can I open a business as a branch instead of starting over? 44180.5604166667 My homeowners association is withholding the ### in our building (pool, gym etc,) and using Covid ###. Can the unit owners sue the board members in a class action lawsuit to reopen them? We pay alot of money each month to have access to our ###. We live in a high rise in Atlantic City New ###.44214.9145833333 You need to go to your HOA meetings.  Probably can't force them to open the pool if there are pandemic restrictions.  What you might try is ask about a refund on some of your fees since the cost to the HOA might be reduced if they aren't needing to spend the amount they used to spend.  The other side is that it might be costing them more on other pandemic measures.  You can always file a court complaint, but for what and will it get you anywhere.  HOA will spend money on an attorney and all the residents will end up paying for that.  Use the HOA rules and ability to vote new board members when the time comes.###44219.8180555556 I currently have a tenant who has not paid rent since ###20. She lives at ###. I filed for an eviction right when the pandemic hit but unfortunately the courts have been closed since. She has avoided all my calls and attempts of communication.She did however apply to a rental assistance program and qualified for the ###. We filled out the rest of the information and she has not updated anything on it. They are about to deny her application because she has not responded for months.She is also damaging the property (what we can see from the outside). She has a dog that has accumulated multiple complaints by neighbors, which we have to pay.We tried selling the townhouse but she will not pick up the realtors calls. She bought a brand new car. What can we do? If I do sell, is she forced to move out? I cannot afford the property anymore and she is not willing to communicate in any way.44221.6541666667 Please provide a copy of your signed lease, proof of damages, and landlord registration statement.###44221.675 Attachment 44227.9902777778 Basically in an owner occupied rental like your she can not renew your lease and you would have to leave.  If you are past the first year and did not renew for another year your lease renews every month and she can give you a ###'t leave start eviction proceedings.  Other than that she has to have one of the other ###.  At the same time she has to maintain the property but you have to force it.  As an owner occupied if it isn't taken care of and you complain too much she could decide to not renew your lease.  You should look for another rental in the near future and make sure the next one is not in an owner occupied property.  That way you have more protections as long as the rent is being paid on time every month.I am looking into if she can claim owner occupied since the property is actually owned by Arbor Properties LLC which she owns.  You might be protected under the full anti-eviction laws.  Once I know for sure I'll let you know and then as long as you are paying rent a not breaking other rules we can go full force on her to fix things and stop harassing you since she won't be able to evict you.  'll find out in the next few days.###44226.1201388889 Hello,I helped with your previous inquiry.  Please attach a copy of the note she gave you.  She owns multiple properties so maybe she wants everything to go to one location.  Also makes it more difficult to you because you will need to mail the payment a few days early to ensure it is received by the due date and not after.  Might want to spend the extra for priority mail which will provide a delivery date and time confirmation.As far as emails, what does your lease say about about notices and communication?  It probably has it on the first page which you need to request her provide you a copy of that first page.  You need to follow what the lease says unless you get proper otice as stated in the leae to changes in rules and regulations which is different than the lease ###s.As far as the window, is the lock/latch broken that is in the center of the window for the upper and lower sections.  If the window i locked it should not fall down.  If it is broken, you can contact the town code enforcement to look at it and ovide a notice to her under the Property Management Code which requires windows to be in good working order.Do not communicate by text except for emergencies that need to be addressed quickly.  Actually good to follow up with a phone call and email or letter as required by the lease.  You can always make a separate email to use for landlord tenant communications only.As far as if the house is on the market and they need to schedule a showing, the proper ###0006524+ hour notice must be provided.  You can require that the number of people is limited as in ###000652 (prospective buyer and realtor or prospective buyer and owner).  Request the realtor to show their state registration and take a picture of it.  You can say it is for possible contact tracing if needed in the future.  Also ask for the name of the prospective buyer and to show ID.  They don't have to allow you to take a picture of the ID or write down anything more than the person's name.  The realtor will have contact info if needed in the future.  You can tell the owner and realtor that you will require that ### guidelines are followed and all people entering need to wear a ### and that the walkthrough must be limited in time.  You can't outright say no without it being considered a lease violation and then attempt to evict you for that violation.With all the issues you are having, you should be looking for another place to move to and move when you are able to according to your lease.  Talk to the local housing assistance and see if they can help.  If you are still having heating problems and the house can't maintain the minimums required call the county health department.Courts cannot evict for non-payment during the moratorium.  They can for lease violations.  If the house is being sold, once there is a contract for sale, they need to provide you with proper notice to let you know when you need to be out by.  If the property is being bought as an investment and will continue to be a rental, then your current lease is good until it ends and the new owner gives you the offer to renew.  If new owner is moving in on their own and wants the entire property to themselves they can end your lease once the current ### is over and if month to month it doesn't take long.  If the owner is living in the building on the other portion of the house, it is considered owner-occupied and they have more options to remove a tenant.Take care,###44225.7125 I have to cut screenshots in half cause my phone says it takes up too much memory.  Iâ€™m leaving our screenshots of my insurance I sent to her.44227.9972222222 I prepared something to send to her about the lease and window but Iâ€™m not sending it unless I have to.  It seems like she is trying to drive us out by annoying us, combing through the lease.  She texted us yesterday to ask about insurance.  When we didnâ€™t answer immediately, she sent two other texts like maybe we werenâ€™t being compliant and I think she said to contact her representative or something.  I have to get the copies from my moms phone and the note as well.  The landlord knew when it was time for me to start the renters insurance, years ago, my mother had been diagnosed with stage ###.  I got the insurance but forgot to put her as additional interest.  Yesterday, I called as quickly as I could to put her on and texted her a copy of the new declarations page with her on it.  Then she said we shouldnâ€™t have used her name or address here.  I had to take care of something else for an hour and was afraid the whole time sheâ€™d flip out I didnâ€™t do it immediately.  But when I did, she didnâ€™t.  We have to be grateful for even just that.  We really donâ€™t want her to have our email or speak to her on the phone.  She has been extremely inappropriate with personally hurtful comments.  Giving her an additional avenue to insult us, badger us for her broken house, or trap us for not responding quickly enough, is exactly what would be possible if we did.  ### have to check that email account all throughout the day. I donâ€™t understand how landlords get to basically be verbally abusive to their tenants.  And for her to act like weâ€™re trying to chat via text.  We donâ€™t want anything other than absolutely necessary contact with her.  And she definitely knows that.  I donâ€™t believe we have initiated contact with her for anything but an emergency since she became this angry person this past year.  The last time was when she turned off the water while I was in the shower in December.  Before that it was only if something broke.  Now we canâ€™t ask for anything to be fixed unless we want to get told to move out.Can you help us by looking at it from the other side of the lens? How much can we â€œget away withâ€ and not get evicted?  I hate to put it like that because I believe we are good tenants.  But we are somehow guilty in her eyes and I guess in the eyes of laws to protect landlords for living in this miserable home sheâ€™s created.  We donâ€™t do anything wrong, we always pay early, we live in her broken home with a giant hole in the bathroom wall and broken heating and outlets.  And I only complained once and she said I should move out after I asked her to fix the lock on the front door. I got told to leave for that.  And my mom, one complaint to the landlord when she came in the apt without wearing a ###.. after my mom said to only come in wearing one.  And my moms immune system becomes ### at different times from cancer treatment.  And the landlord knows this.  And she would not say she would wear a ###.  And became furious when my mother kept texting it was necessary after the landlord would not give a response.  Letâ€™s say she starts eviction proceedings over the email addresses, how fast would we be ordered to leave.  If we presented our side to the judge that she basically harassed us with comments that are causing us distress and needless pain.I know my mom will give her her email before it gets to that but this feels insane.  We do not want her in our lives.  Itâ€™s like sheâ€™s our ###.  If I ever contacted the town about the broken heat in the living room, sheâ€™d evict us.  Sheâ€™d find a way.  Weâ€™ve never shampooed the carpets and itâ€™s in the lease.  So I guess thatâ€™s as good a reason as any to throw out a woman struggling with cancer treatment and her autistic daughter during a pandemic.  She could do that right? Thank you for your information about the possible showings and move out dates etc.  weâ€™re in a two family home.  The landlord does live in the downstairs apt, what additional benefits does she have for that?  We have section ###â€™t start looking to move into any other place till the lease is almost done.  We already asked the town.  Otherwise ### lose section 8.  And my mom flip flops out of fear which I understand with her immune system.  Sheâ€™s also scared of repair people coming in.  Itâ€™s all a lose lose. In all honesty, it seems like I should just let her steamroll over us cause sheâ€™s never going to stop and sheâ€™s got everything to hold over our head. She believes we deserve to be treated this way and it will never change.  And itâ€™s very hard to live on top of someone who feels that way and who also controls the house.44226.0208333333 Iâ€™m having a problem sending screenshot copies I donâ€™t think itâ€™s working 44227.9951388889 LLC owns property.   LLC cannot occupy a unit.   So, you are not in an owner occupied property.  She has to follow all anti eviction act law.###44226.2 Last one, sorry it had to be in pieces but my phone says size too large for everything.44228.0006944444 Ok.  Additional interest is ok.  Don't ever add landlord as additional insured like your lease says.  But, you are protected by anti eviction act.  You can request heat to be fixed and not be evicted for that.  But, you need to make sure you follow all aspects of your lease.###44228.0840277778 Thank you.  Thatâ€™s good news, right?  Iâ€™m going to attach the stuff from my moms phone and the note she left.  It comes across tame but itâ€™s not meant to be.44227.9888888889 landlord left a note for us last night to mail our rents check to a location a few towns away from now on. We said we would. But itâ€™s odd since she lives downstairs and weâ€™ve left it under her door for years.Weâ€™ve have had enormous issues with her that started when she refused to wear a ### when entering the apt. When contacted the next day we stated in the future ###s must be won and six feet must be observed. Personal attacks were then launched by her(all of this was via text)and then she said to get someone to help us find a new place to live and that we are crazy. That is her M.O.:â€œget out, youâ€™re crazyâ€, when weâ€™ve had conflict in the past. Then she wrote the next day she was sorry and we could take it to mediation to discuss the manor we carry trash bags out of the house is upsetting to her. We never acknowledged that message.So then the handwritten note left last night. It also said she prefers emails so we had to give her our emails ASAP. As usual it wasnâ€™t a request but an order. We donâ€™t want to give her more avenues to leave crazy messages so we wrote unfortunately it isnâ€™t our preferred method of contact and we prefer to keep our emails private. Do we have the right?One of her recent complaints with us is sheâ€™s unhappy her window is broken in the attic so she arrived at the conclusion itâ€™s not that the window is broken, itâ€™s that weâ€™re going up there to open it. We rarely ever even use the attic. She tried to say we were crazy. And told my mother, get your daughter up there already to shut that window. Even though I had ankle injury.  My mom is recovering from intense treatment for cancer. She does not care. I went up there to shut it. And we had to teach her the upper part of a window can fall down when broken. She never acknowledged a thing she did was wrong. Instead she went the trash bag mediation route. And now communication only through email.If sheâ€™s selling: my motherâ€™s immune system is very fragile. I have ###. So the question is, what protections do we have with both my mother and I being high risk?Can we say she may only record on video the ### to prevent strangers coming in here? If not, how much notice is she required to give with covid before bringing in potential buyers?Is there protection from two high risk ill people being evicted during covid due to sale of a house? We are destitute, on Medicaid and food stamps. We ldo not have the money to pay movers, or put down a security deposit. Let alone how we would find a place considering my mother has been advised to stay home period.44223.7479166667 My daughter (###) and her FiancÃ© (###) (###) and one doing Zoom Learning are renting a home and the lease expires on ###st they were proactive and asked the landlord on the 15th of January via text to rent for another year (Example Attached) because of virtual learning and work they wanted to do in the home .

We eventually broke up over behavior I was not okay with and he had me sign the title over to him so he could refinance it. He also stated he would be selling it. He has done neither and is not paying on time. He claims he cannot refinance because he needs his taxes and since he does freelance he filed them very late. I have been hounding him to pay and he does not do it on time affecting both our credits. The bank told the only way for me to be let off is if he refinances which is for some reason not doing since he is way more than well off.I was also wrongfully evicted by him. We lived together in an apartment and he told me I had to leave right then and there so I left to my fathers. He signed a roommate release form on my behalf, but the apartment called me stating that I cannot leave until all my stuff is out the apartment. He told me to tell them that none of it is here and I did. This is my fault, he eventually threw some of my stuff out and it took forever to even get my items without having to hound him since he would not respond.I literally have no idea what to do.Thank you.44237.6090277778 Depends on the by-laws and other governing documents and what they allow and the procedures they require.

Thanks!44252.6159722222 Hello,I am reaching out in order to get advice about some unusual clauses in a new lease I just signed. I was in the middle of a lease in a duplex, which was sold, and was strongarmed into signing a new lease with the new owner halfway through my current lease. I ended up just going along with it and had him amend some questionable items out (cleaning fees, paying $###, etc). There were also a few that I missed and wondering what my recourse is at this point, since it's been almost a month after signing. The new owner is involved in a pyramid scheme 3rd party energy company called Stream, and there is a portion of the lease that requires a tenant to send the landlord a copy of their current utility ###001103 and sign up with them within the first month. It is obviously in his personal financial interest that I do this, but I am happy with ### and want to avoid being entangled into a scam company like this. My ### account hasn't been modified and I haven't been contacted about it from my landlord, but I want to be prepared for the instance when he tried to push me to sign up or threatened to evict me if I don't. Also, there is another section of the lease that states:SEVERABILITY: If any ### or condition of this lease is contrary to law the remainder of the lease shall be ### and shall continue to be binding upon the parties."This seems questionable and I would like some insight on this as well.I just am looking for advice on how to respond to my landlord if he makes this an issue.Thank you for your help with this!

I have not been paying rent, as her ex had an agreement with her paying rent, not me, while allowing me to live there. Internet, and fixing appliances, grocery shopping, and various projects around the apartment have been done by/paid for by me. My boyfriend comes over and helps me clean, cook, fix things, etc. I have a back injury from ###. My mother has cancer and decided she doesn't like my boyfriend, so she falsely told her ex, that my boyfriend causes her stress. This is not true. I initially asked my boyfriend to come over as much as possible because my mother was hitting me and I needed a ### of this just in case. My injury came long after at work. My mother is a hoarder and hates it when anything gets moved or thrown away so she manipulates the people around her into believing that she's the victim and having them harass, bully, and make fun of me as a punishment for doing anything in any way other than her way. Now she's using this tactic to get her ex to bar my boyfriend from entering the apartment. My boyfriend is jewish and has mental illness that keeps him from being employable, so he's on disability. My mother decided she didn't like my boyfriend after she found out that he's Jewish and has mental illness.At one point after my mother and her ex split, they had a written agreement as part of the divorce that her and myself could live there. I don't currently have a copy of this agreement, but I think it expired. I had an oral agreement with her ex about being allowed to live there that didn't include me paying rent. Now her ex is threatening me with legal action and eviction because he doesn't want me to have my boyfriend visit as per my mother's manipulation.Do I have any rights as a tenant and am I even considered a tenant under all these circumstances? Can I get evicted for having my boyfriend visit? Can my boyfriend be barred and/or removed by the police from the premises even though neither he nor I did anything illegal or anything that harmed anyone? Do I have the right to have the owner of the apartment (who's intending on staying there for a while to try to help my mother get better, although he has his own primary apartment in the ###) removed from his own property if he threatens, frightens and harasses me?What are my options if I don't have the funds nor the credit to move out?Are there any available actions for me to take to avoid getting continuesly harassed and made to feel unsafe in the apartment if I don't have the option of moving?44264.4215277778 Questions are posed at the end (i.e. after the ### description).###008 I acquired Title to my condominium in the WDP Neighborhood.

Thank you for your consideration in reading this far.44273.8013888889 This is a bit more complicated than what this service can provide answers.  This situation involves many parties and will also depend on what your actions have been over time.  What maintenance requests did you file in writing that never were addresses?  Did you go to the Association meetings and complain at those meetings?  Do you have meeting minutes to prove it?  Are there others that own units or even rent in the property having issues?  Is your insurance just looking for any little thing to deny coverage?  Did you go cheap and get the minimum coverage possible and that is why they are not covering the damages you filed a claim for?  The pictures you provided show an aging building that needs so repair, not termite damage.  The one shows rot that occurs on many window casing along the bottom that weren't sealed properly and should be replaced.  Some of this will be a battle with your association.  Some will be a battle with your insurance.I would advise you to find a local attorney that can evaluate your issue from both sides and advise you of your options.  You can list anyone you want on the court complaint as a defendant and each of them will try to get a summary judgment to remove them from the complaint or find them not at fault because you didn't prove the bare minimum for your case.###44283.5472222222 My home was revaluated and assessed at a lower rate prior to the my paying a higher rate.

I spoke to the complex manager about removing me from the lease and she told me she wouldnâ€™t do it so Iâ€™m trying to figure out how to either get my name removed from the lease or have it put into my name solely and take over residence of the apartment being as she canâ€™t pay the rent. She also has another man and child living there with her which is breaking the rental agreement. My credit has been ruined, I canâ€™t get accepted to any apartment complexes or properties and Iâ€™m soon to be homeless due to this so Iâ€™m in desperate need of help or advice on what to do. 44302.575 Please attach a copy of the current lease.  You most likely will have to give written notice that you are ###inating the lease with the proper days notice according to the current lease.  At that point the landlord can offer a new lease to the remaining tenants.

Did you send a written letter as it states to tell them you are not renewing?  It specifically states that if you do not that you agree to the renewal.I need more of a history of when things like you moving out happened, who you told and how, when was the last time you paid any rent, etc.  Original lease was until end of ###20.  You would be responsible for the rent up until then unless you gave written notice of early lease termination.  Not signing the renewal was not enough for the lease to renew, but that might be able to be fought in court if needed.###44302.7604166667 Who is her" as well as your father?

And for proof of each payment?"44302.8194444444 Your lease is with the landlord.  It is a contract.  You have to follow the contract.  You both signed it and are responsible for it.  The argument is the renewal? But you were supposed to send a certified letter to the landlord, not tell the ex girlfriend.You need to request all the items I stated before you can do anything to dispute costs.  Also send a certified letter stating you never received a copy of the renewal and never signed the renewal.###44302.8597222222 First question is why?Next, do you have a mortgage on the property?

This way there is no possible mortgage issue.###"44313.1048611111 Contact a local landlord/tenant attorney.  They will most likely file in special civil court and request their attorney fee from the landlord.  Just make sure any fee agreement you sign shows that you will not have to pay the attorney fee.

He is making false allegations as his reasoning behind this.  He has so far refunded the amount of $###.### $2,175.00.  His reasonings are as follows: missing fire alarm, missing rack oven, nails or ###, and missing pantry that he provided to remodel the apartment to my spouse at no charge and it had to be cut in half to fit the apartment, which was left there and its not missing.  I have proof of apartment being in good conditions, as I cleaned myself and he is also stating shortness on rent payments.  I also have proof that rent was paid to him and according to what was agreed, he is also ### late fees he had mentioned would be waived.  Landlord is acting in spite of us not being able to renew a long ### lease or buy his property.  Knowingly we had nowhere to go, he didnt let us stay until we can find a place to stay and were forced to stay in a hotel.  We have witnesses that have stated, he is constantly not returning deposit to his tenants, witnesses that we were compliance to do showings of apartment, because he placed for sale, and witnesses he is acting erractic as he showed to my workplace (without any advise whatsoever), to drop off documents and asking weird questions to my co-worker.  His constant harrasment to show the apartment at any time and to sign a long ### lease, none of our benefit, drove us to leave the apartment, he would constantly text, or call, interrupting our work, studying or even dinner times.  We have a ###; which he didnt care that we didnt have a place to go in times of Covid and still did not let us further stay at least for one more month.  Not only that, the place was in such state of filth at time of lease signing that both kitchen and bathroom had to be redone.  He provided materials and my husband did the work at not charge.  Now, in spite of us leaving he is refusing to provide our full security deposit.  I have proof of my deposit payment, videos of how apartment was left, and his communication to us but it wont upload to this site.  Please advise on what is the best course to proceed, thank you. 44315.9152777778 If I put a complaint in small claims for the return of my full deposit; with as you said doubling any illegal held amount , would I have to go to court? We are low income and canâ€™t really afford attorney fees.  I didnâ€™t speak to an attorney because I didnâ€™t think it would be needed as we had a good relationship prior to letting landlord know that we are renewing lease, he acting in spite and even showed himself to my place of work.  Is a restraining order necessary? He has been acting very erratic as well, as told from my coworker that saw him.  I didnâ€™t see him as I work back office , thank you 44320.0173611111 You can file a complaint in small claims for the return of your security deposit.  You would argue for the full amount and double any illegally held amount.  You can talk to a local attorney because an attorney can get their fees from the landlord if they are found to be in violation of the security deposit law.  You should have discussed this with a local tenant attorney before moving out.###44319.9625 Should I have a lawyer present at closing when buying a house.

Plus to you know how much a lawyer would cost for that .44327.6618055556 You have the right to have an attorney represent your interests in the purchase of a house. There are many ways an attorney can help you during the purchase. The attorney will review and revise the contract for the purchase of the house. The attorney can hold the deposit in his or her trust account, pending the closing. The attorney will review the home inspection report with you and determine if credits towards closing should be requested for certain repairs or if the sellers should make certain repairs before closing. The attorney will also review the proposed closing documents for accuracy. The cost of the attorney will vary greatly.

About three weeks ago I emailed my property manager to let them know that I wouldnâ€™t be renewing my lease which is ending July of 2021. I let them know that under Gov. Murphyâ€™s executive order that I would be paying my last month rent with my security deposit. The property manager replied to that email acknowledging my notice to vacate but that I wasnâ€™t able to use the security to pay last months rent because the Executive Order expired. However, I sent him updated information along with the copy of the executive order no ###. Which was signed on ### of ###. Both my emails (one with the updated executive order and the follow up to see if they received it) have gone unanswered and I would like to know what I have to do on my end to make sure that my last month rent is paid with my security deposit and on time as to ensure there is no late fee.Well over ###.

You can't say you are using it for your last month's rent.  You also can't demand that they pay you the difference as soon as possible.

I believe my security deposit balance is currently $2031.08.  After deducting ### rent of $### it leaves a balance of ###.08.  Applying the ###.### ### $###.###.

If you have any questions please contact ### Sawka Esq. at ### or ###-###."This way all your security deposit is basically returned and they can't play any games with deductions for damages.  You should also request a walk through once moved out and have them sign a letter stating any damages that are found during the move out walk through.

It would be considered an early termination of the lease.  The landlord can sue you for the rent you would owe until someone else is found to take your place.You might be able to claim the lease in invalid because it has a clause that state tenants are responsible for landlord attorney fees but it is missing the statement required by law that the tenants also have the right to attorney fees if there is a dispute under the lease and the tenant wins.  It is a gray area, but could help keep the landlord from going after you.  N.J.S.A. 2A:18-61.67Make sure you follow the notice requirements and tell the landlord in the way the lease states.###44346.7236111111 I rent from an apartment complex (###) with my boyfriend and newborn daughter.

Who pays to fix anything that needs repair or updating in the future?  Who is paying the property taxes?  Who is living in the property and getting that advantage?  Lots of unanswered questions from your short description of the issue and your questions. When it needs a new roof who is paying for that $###0-###0K expense?  Not knowing the address, current value of the property, and parents history with the property are other items that might be needed for an estate planning look at this (gift the property now or inherit it later).  If gifted now your cost basis is zero and when sold in future all the sales proceeds if taxable profit.  If inherited, the value on date of death is the cost basis so when sold in future taxable profit is only the amount above that.### - Hire a real estate attorney to ensure the deed is made with the proper type of ownership.

I pointed out my landlord's failure to comply with the Security Deposit Act simply as an example of his shoddy, shady way of handling his responsibilities  as Landlord. Another example would be when he insisted I, not any of his able-bodied tenants, park in the street while he puttered around doing whatever, and my car was hit and nearly totalled. And once in the beginning I paid him in the month's rent in cash and he was delighted; so much so that he took off immediately without even offering me a receipt which I then had to ### him for. He's just always trying to get over if you know what I mean.I understand that ordinarily once my ###, I would be considered a 'holdover' and would automatically go month to month with the same obligations as when I was under the terms of that ###. However HE's the one who stipulated that There is no month to month." another year long lease is "Required" which he failed to offer me as a Renewal. To my mind that meant I was free to give him a Notice to Vacate at will; same as he would be free to give ME a Notice to Vacate because there is no longer a valid Landlord/Tenant Agreement because it expired in ###. And he can't keep my Security Deposit as his rental income for the following ###.

You also need to give notice the way the lease says is required (usually in writing and by certified mail).  If it is handwritten about the must renew on an annual basis, did you initial that change prior to signing?

The court administrator replied that it was not a trial only a hearing.  In my personal experience this a common experience with the Trenton Municipal court.  Last year I appeared on a similar charge (same Trenton Municipal Court).  Likewise I wrote to the court administrator pleading not guilty requesting a trial.  When I appeared I found that my request had been ignored  and found that it wasn't a trial; judge would only accept a guilty plea or schedule a trial two months later.  When I showed the judge my written request for trial she explained that in spite of my request it was nonetheless only a hearing and could only reschedule for trial.  After some back-and-forth between judge prosecutor and me the judge became annoyed with my request for dismissal  never clearly explaining why she would not dismiss the complaint.

If you provide more details about your payment history, how much security deposit your have, your share of the rent that is paid vs. the housing voucher, total late fees due, and a copy of your entire lease I could be more thorough in my review.###44399.5854166667 My ex-girlfriend is on the deed to my home that I purchases with my VA loan, can she sell my home if i don't want to sell?44400.69375 No. She has equal rights to the house.  When it says joint it means joint like a joint checking account.There is a good chance the attorney mentioned it and you didn't think it wasw a problem at the time because you were in love".  Did you just pay the attorney to prepare the deed or did you pay for counseling on the transaction pros and cons without your girlfriend there?  I wasn't there to know.

I was curious what was actually filed with the county since the copy you attached to the other question was not a signed/executed deed.  The one I attached is the one you signed on ### and was filed with the county.  It is not joint ownership with right of survivorship.  It is a tenant is common deed since there is no other designation on it.  Usually it is assumed that each person owns equal shares.  You might be able to fight this if she only paid you a dollar and you have paid the down payment and all mortgage payments.  But, you need to discuss with a local attorney and see what your options are to fight to get her off your deed, or to designate that her ownership is only $###.You might ask about coercion to sign, etc., by the ex-girlfriend.  It will cost you money in court, but there are possibilities.Good luck,Mike44401.9861111111 Your deed makes you joint owners with right of survivorship.

I sublease with a rental contract with no end date, the words 'month to month', and deposit I get back if landlord has ###, and I pay missing utilities on top of usual utilities if landlord struggles with finding ###. My landlord notified me ### owner sold the house and I must leave by ###. In person she said she'll ' do something drastic otherwise...' She said ###. ###, my landlord admitted she received a notice to quit and a separate letter from the owner's attorney and didn't tell me about it. The company that manages the property informed me ### that my landlord will be shutting off electricity and water utilities on the 31st of August and they are planning to call the police if I'm not gone on ###st. I payed rent on time for ###/###. When my landlord said I only get deposit back after I'm already gone I got nervous and I told her for August rent use the deposit. The sublease market is nonexistent right now due to covid (I haven't gotten a single email or phone call back about listings I responded to). I have no family to stay with. Is there something I can do? As in press charges for not keeping lease agreement, harrassment, pain and suffering, and criminal negligence against my landlord? What about pressing charges against the management company or owner? Or is there something else I can do that can help me avoid eviction? I called the courthouse. They said without a docket # my case can't be heard before a judge. Even if the notice to quit exists and the fact that it is directed at my landlord and not me doesn't mean my case can't be heard, how do I get the docket #? How do I keep the utilities from being cut off? What do I tell the police if they show up ###st? And if I press charges what should I do to help prevent eviction while doing so? There is another issue. The owner who I never even knew his name reached out by letter to my aging step-father ### offering money for deposit on new place if I move out soon.

When I signed my lease, I had agreed to pay $###, which is the smallest room in our ###. I was told that my other roommates paid more than me since their rooms are much larger. Now, the roommate who is looking to move out, informed me that she has been paying only $###, despite having the ### room. Upon reviewing the lease, it's been made clear that she has been significantly overcharging me for rent, essentially robbing me of my money. Do I have a case to sue her? What steps should I be taking? How can I resolve this issue without losing my apartment. I have someone planning to take over her spot on the lease since she is leaving in October, but I would like to have my money back since she has been silently overcharging me.44430.8222222222 The amount you pay is your agreement/contract you made with I am guessing the main tenant on the lease who is finding the other roommates to help split the rent.  It is t clear from the attached page that is cut off a bit.  Would need to see the entire lease and has to include all ###.  Was the $###?  You most likely can't sue her" since u agreed to pay a certain amount and have been paying it.  It is basically your contract.  You can discuss it with them and see if they will make it more fair but they don't have to change it.  Your only option would be to move if you can't work it out to try to get lower rent.###"44435.575 Again, you haven't shown me anything to make a determination, just your word and opinions.  I would advise you to talk to a local landlord tenant attorney to review all the information and see if you have a case for constructive eviction where you would be permitted to terminate your lease early.  If you don't, the landlord can come after you for the rent for the remainder of the lease.###44445.6076388889 Even if I images of the damage and correspondence with time stamps between the landlord and I ? I will check with the DOH. 44445.5020833333 From your description it doesn't seem like enough to get out of your lease a couple months early.  You can always give proper notice (number of days in advance based on your lease) and leave early.  The landlord will most likely enforce the lease, keep the security deposit because of unpaid rent for the months left on lease.  As far as proper notice, read what your lease says.  Most likely, test and phone calls are not proper notice.  Did your landlord give you the proper notice about your security deposit (either in the lease or separate letter) stating the bank the deposit is in, address of bank, type of account and interest rate on the account?  If not, you might be able to use your security deposit toward future rent and at least leave without having to fight to get your deposit back.  If you leave the property with damages the landlord can still come after you for costs later.###44444.7076388889 I have a lease for my apartment for the standard year. I currently have a couple of months left, but I would like to get out sooner than that. The first month because of our landlord's negligence we had many power outages within out apartment. We have called and texted him many times about the electric work that needs to be done because there is a child in the home & the power is constantly cutting out. Many times he has stated he will look into it and it took a while and me threatening legal action for him to send someone out here. All of my complaints fall on deaf ears and I would like to leave. Someone please assist. 44438.8145833333 Takes more than that to break your lease early without repercussions.  Your word alone does not work.  You need code enforcement, department of Health, or other agencies to get involved which will first force the landlord to fix problems or possibly be fined.###44444.7222222222 Thanks for your response.

If no, do that.###) Is it central air or a built in unit?###) What does your lease say about maintenance responsibilities?  Would help if you attached your entire lease to review.Most likely it is the landlord's responsibility if it is a permanently installed system that came with the rental.  You need  provide a written letter stating all the dates it was reported, the date the person came out to look at it once, and that the lack of A/C in the summer months is a habitability issue.  Request a rent abatement of ###5% of the rent amount for the months of May through September for each of the years you lived there and for those months that the A/C was broken (it's a try, but most likely won't work unless you go to court).  Tell the landlord you will be withholding rent until the air condition is fixed.  Once it is fixed you will pay all the withheld rent.This letter must be sent by certified mail to the landlord, and another copy by regular mail.   Make sure you keep a copy of the letter.  You must keep the withheld rent in a bank account and not spend it.  If the landlord files for eviction you would go to court and show the judge the letter and explain the situation to the judge.  The judge will require you to deposit all the withheld rent with the court office.  If you don't have it to deposit that day, you will be evicted.###44449.7493055556 I haven't had air conditioning in my apartment for at least three years. I have put in multiple maintenance requests in over the years. They came the first year to look at it but didn't fix it and they haven't been back since. I'm trying to figure out if this is a violation of my tenant rights, if I have a case and if so what kind of compensation I might get. Everything I read online about tenant rights only specifies heating not ac. I can't afford to leave but the heat gets absolutely unbearable some nights. I feel like they've just been ignoring my requests. Do I potentially have a case against them?44449.7423611111 I you can put together the history of the time you were in the property and the months of hot weather that the air condition id not work, you can try to request a rent abatement for all those months for a certain discount based on the value of the rental was less than paid due to the air condition that was included at move-in and part of the property did not work all those months.  You will need proof of each time you told them, a little bit of time for reasonable time to repair, and then the rest after would count.The landlord might ignore and you can take it to small claims or special civil part depending on value of claim and file a claim for rent abatement due to habitability issues.  Since you lease has attorney fees as additional rent you have the right to request your attorney fees paid by landlord if you win the lawsuit.  Because of this you might want to find a local attorney to file and litigate for you.Next time give them notice in writing and have them sign a copy of it.  If they do not repair in a timely manner you can then give them ten notice that you are withholding rent until it is repaired and also requesting a rent abatement during the time the A/C has been broken until it is fixed.  Once fixed you give them the withheld rent minus any agreed to rent abatement.  This gets tricky if you don't follow all the rules the tenant must follow when doing this.  Again, a local landlord tenant attorney might be a good first stop to discuss.Take care,###44463.8347222222 Thank you so much for getting back to me!

You most likely can terminate your lease early without penalty due to the landlords failure to ensure your covenant  quiet enjoyment of the rental premises.  The landlord would then take you to court to fight it if they want to.  Make sure the letter states it, gives a detailed timeline with all the times you contacted the landlord about the problem, any additional information like police incident dates, etc.  Again, you should check with a local tenant attorney to make sure you have everything lined up because constructive eviction requires you to move out and once you go that step, the landlord could try to enforce the lease.###44465.7104166667 Need more details to be able to give a decent answer.

Originally my room was the known double, but upon measuring the square footage of the other rooms, I realized the house can legally fit ###, not ###. there are ### 125sq fr. Based on my research on occupancy standards, two people to a room shouldnâ€™t be a problem. So iâ€™m trying to relet ### ### - ###. The reason I personally am leaving is because iâ€™ve experienced a lot of landlord harassment between him coming into the house without permission, yelling at me and making false accusations about me and my roommates to a housing inspector, and overall not preparing the house for us to move in after the previous tenants left the house in disarray. Iâ€™ve had housing bc inspectors come and issue violations, but they donâ€™t come back to check on things unless I call and at this point I would rather leave then try to fix a house Iâ€™ll never be comfortable in. Also per the lease nothing is stated about occupancy rules what so ever except that having ###. How do I make it so my landlord cannot prevent me from letting two people move into each room. there are also two bathrooms and the entire floor is over ###. there would be ### ###. the girl who i found wants to sign only if her group can double and have those three rooms so i just donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m just worried that if I tell my landlord that two people can have one room he will just tell the prospect tenants that thatâ€™s not true and make it harder for me to move out. I also wouldnâ€™t want him to reject these people for that reason but tell me there was another reason just because he doesnâ€™t want people doubling. The lease is until the end of May and the total rent for the unit is $###â€™t care how the rent was split between us so we decided based on square footage of the rooms we were renting. Also I have considered the idea of constructive eviction, but the remaining violations  arenâ€™t as severe, and three of the roommates arenâ€™t moving out so it wouldnâ€™t really work Iâ€™m guessing. Ultimately Iâ€™m just worried that getting out of my lease will be difficult even though I feel unsafe and heâ€™s saying things go prevent me from securing a replacement. 44522.8673611111 The lease shows six people sharing.

No money was sent in yet and the lease doesn't begin until ###22. How can she get out of it?44550.8138888889 ###,First, I am taking your word for it that your mother is of sound mind, because in the beginning of your question you stated that she has dementia.  One can be of generally sound mind and have occasional dementia, so the two statements are not necessarily inconsistent, and I will assume for the sake of answering this that her dementia is only occasional.  If she was of sound mind when she told you that you can stay in the house, and if she has not been declared by a court to be unable to make decisions, then I know of no reason you would not be allowed to stay in her house legally.  I am operating under the assumption that the house is still hers.  However, ultimately she is probably going to have to support you, since it seems like dealing with your brother is almost inevitable.Does the POA in favor of your brother give him power to act for your mother regarding decisions that are not medical?  For instance, if the POA includes matters concerning the house, then he can act on her behalf with respect to it, including pursuing a legal action to have you evicted, or even something as informal as have a locksmith break the locks.  On the other hand, she can oppose such an eviction by revoking the POA.Your brother cannot unilaterally decide to put your mother in a nursing home if she opposes going into one.  I would suggest that perhaps next time you discuss the issue with your mother, let her know that her brother tries to put her in a nursing home, she can move back into her own house with you to look after her instead.  I would imagine your brother probably does not want her in a nursing home, anyway, since that could wipe out the value of any inheritance down the road.There are several practical issues that one has to consider, as opposed to how a lawsuit should resolve in theory.  One of those is that your brother has the POA.  If he were to call the police and claim you were a trespasser - something he apparently could legitimately believe since your mother does not want to tell him that you can stay there - what would you show the police to defend your right to be there?  At a minimum, you should obtain a written statement from your mother to have h### in such event, reciting that you are allowed to stay there, and that she is of sound mind and body.  If possible, that statement should be notarized, and if you cannot get your mother to a notary, see if there is a way to have her get it notarized online.Another, more aggressive suggestion is for you, too, to get a Power of Attorney in your favor from your mother.  That way, if law enforcement got involved, both you and your brother would have powers of attorney, and it would be extremely unlikely you would be removed.  To be valid, the POA would have to be notarized.You could also try to record your mother giving you permission to stay in the home, either verbally, or better yet, via video.I imagine you are correct that your brother stops by the house from time-to-time, though I don't know why he wouldn't just change your mother's mailing address with the post office and such.  If the mail is still going to her house and you do move in, I would recommend you help her change the address to either his house or her apartment depending upon what she wants so that your brother has less reason to stop by.I know of no reason you cannot put up cameras, though if they involve damaging the home, even if ###, such as by nailing their supports into the wall, you should get your mother's permission.  You can just tell her it is for security purposes.  Perhaps there is a way you can live there without it being obvious to your brother, and in combination with the cameras, which these days can operate off smartphone apps, be able to have some warning when he arrives at the house.Is it possible your mother would consider selling the house and dividing the proceeds between you and your brother.So, while I do believe you would be within your rights legally to lock him out if your mother says that you can, I do not that is likely to work out for you unless your mother supports you one way or another, or in multiple of the ways I suggest above.  For instance, recording video of her signing the power of attorney to show would, presumably, show her to be in sound mind at the time she is signing, and make it more likely to hold up in court should it come to that.Anyway, I hope that helps.  Feel free to ask follow-up questions.

Nursing home. Dad dies from the brain cancer ###20-relations between brother and I sour. I cleaned out my parents house bc I was thinking we'd surely have to sell so my mom could stay in nursing home. Bro and I no longer on speaking terms at this point. ###20-unbeknownst to me my brother has moved mother to her friends extra apartment. June2021- After a tough divorce, the hits just keep coming. I was attacked by said brother with a baseball bat(he just recently pleaded guilty to  simple assault), Im still unable to work bc of a prior disability and Covid-19, was involved in a bad relationship that ended with domestic violence charges and me needing an FRO against my abuser, and recently was hit by an uninsured driver in the van that doubled as my home. My van was totaled, and I now find myself homeless. I spoke to my mother for the first time since I've been homeless yesterday, she said she's scared that my brother will put her back in the nursing home if she tells him that she wants me to stay at her house, that sits empty for ### now btw. So we decided I would just go there and stay until someone of authority told me otherwise. I know the locks have been changed, but it's the house I grew up in, and I wasn't known for keeping curfew, so I'll get in without an issue. My brother was, and I'm assuming still is, stopping over biweekly to check the mail. So my question is, can I change the locks and put up cameras and no trespassing signs? Can I be removed as a trespasser? Can I stop my brother from coming in?Just to recap: my brother has POA over my mother's medical decisions. She is of sound mind, and is in control of her faculties. Its just that she never paid bills or dealt with insurance companies or ppwk before. My dad did all of that for her. My brother was the executor of the estate, but as far as I know everything went right to my mom. Mom has verbally ok'd me moving in. She wants to move back herself, but she's scared to rock the boat or, 'upset my brother, bc she is afraid he'll put her in the nursing home. And he's in charge of everything, so she can't upset him.' those are her words, and yes, I'm aware they sound a lot like elder abuse. But that's another topic. My brother is very difficult to work with (extremely self-centered and unempathetic, his way or ###) So reaching out would be pointless imo. So how should I handle this odd situation?44559.9701388889 I'll try to find out the ownership of the property, and whether there is a guardianship.Let me have the full legal names of both of your parents.Also, let me know what county your mother's home is in, what county she resides in now, and the county where your brother resides.### SparkMail: ###., # ######, New ### 07013Phone/Text/WhatsApp: ###Fax: ######44562.0375 Mother:Teresa ### MotchnikFather:Walter ### MotchnikBrother:Gregory ### Motchnik              ###, PA 19007Parents house:###, ### 08611Mother is now residing at ###.

Could he be her legal guardian?Not concerned about financial abuse by my brother, he is well off and the house I'm speaking of is a rowhome that was worth more in ###, when my parents bought it from my grandparents,  than it is now. How would I even go about finding out the status of the house, or the POA, or anything concerning the estate of my father?My siblings and I all pitched in to hire an elder law attorney, on my brother's suggestion, when my dad passed. ### total upfront. Less than six months later, all communication between us stopped, mostly because of my brother's controlling and arrogant behavior. My sister and I have both contacted the attorney's office, only to be stonewalled. She was even told that, 'theres no record of her being a client' and promptly hung up on. Is there a way to get him to share information? My mom wants to come home. In the past I wasn't in a position where I could care for her, but after the divorce, and some growing-up on my part, I now realize how important it is to care for a parent in their home. She lived on this street for ###, raised ###, my father was born and died in this house. Sorry for rambling.Basically what I'm asking is, how can I get my brother to work together with me? He has far more resources and connections than me. What I do have is the will and determination to not go quietly this time around. I might not have gotten my dad's work ethic, but I do share his ### for standing up for the underdog and fighting for what's right.44561.0395833333 I joined tenant advocates to speak out on the substandard living conditions which caused my disabled son to be sick, harassment, fraud, and retaliation from the property manager at the Board Of Commissioner meeting. I find myself in landlord-tenant court ###.During the first court proceedings, I expressed to the judge that the case arose against me after tenants expressed their concerns to Executive Director and Commissioners about our personal information being accessible to the asset manager. I also explained her misconduct. The asset manager is a convicted felon of fraud, grand theft and tenants have known facts of the asset manager stealing the identity of an elderly lady, doing ### while on the clock neglecting her manager duties, how she harasses and retaliate against tenants who she can not get over on. I mentioned to the judge that the plaintiff was given my attorney's contact information and failed to contact him. He can prove it was not income it was a one-time settlement, Lastly, I explained that the plaintiff's attorney is providing false evidence stating I signed the certified receipt that was addressed to the wrong address. I also had a copy of the complaint on my door that also had the wrong address, I brought it into court after hearing both sides the case was dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiff's attorney re-filed, we appeared in court in front of a new judge. I showed the judge the dismissal with prejudice disposition. The plaintiff's attorney falsely states I denied being served. On the record, the new judge states he canâ€™t change another judge's decision and he will only hear the case if he presents the transcripts of the previous court proceedings and he then dismissed the case again. I left the courtroom only to return when I noticed I didnâ€™t have my copy of the disposition letter. I ### the attorney asking the judge off the record  â€œ If I go to Judge ### to have him amend his order will that suffice? The judge said Yes. I received no notices that the attorney applied to seek relief from judgment, which I was not given the opportunity to oppose the plaintiff's application. The plaintiff attorney was granted relief from judgment and I was brought to court without the transcripts that were requested on the record. The attorney knows the transcripts would have discredited him and the client's statement. Is the conversation between the judge and plaintiff attorney considered ex-parte communication? It gets complicated because after the dismissal mold was found and tested that showed high levels, which left my son and me with complications and homeless for ###. I asked to be relocated, Out of retaliation, I receive eviction notices that hinder me from obtaining a habitable apartment for my son who just had heart surgery and now have Covid due to crowded living conditions.44560.2583333333 I live in Newark, ### and the case is pending in Superior Court Landlord/Tenant. If a case was dismissed with prejudice and the plaintiff re-filed the same case that was dismissed with prejudice but the matter is now in front of a different judge, the defendant explains to the current judge that the case was dismissed with prejudice previously and hand over the disposition letter, the opposing attorney falsely states that the case was dismissed because the defendant denied being properly served. While on record the judge states that he will hear the case if the plaintiff brings the transcripts from the previous case then dismisses the case again. However the defendant leaves the courtroom after the case was dismissed, but returned shortly because the disposition notice was left, and the defendant ### the plaintiff attorney asking the judge for permission to seek relief from the previous judge instead of producing the transcripts which were stated on the record and the judge say yes while off the record and the defendant was not made aware of the changes to oppose it is it considered ex parte communication?44560.1479166667 Not sure based on the story you provided.  Based on the first page you posted did you demand ###?###44560.1625 My mortgage company has been giving me the run around. Itâ€™s difficult to get someone to help. My ex husband was off my mortgage did a quick claim deed years ago. Everything came in my name I could modify my mortgage, which I did without him, now I canâ€™t. This mortgage company took my old one over and but him back on and itâ€™s been a nightmare ever since.  Now the house is going to go into foreclosure because my ex wouldnâ€™t sign new modification, now he will. Do we have time to still modify and can we get a lawyer to help us with all of the stuff they have been doing to avoid helping me? They are a big company who will just keep me on hold. Should I report the company?44568.8854166667 Hello, I need advice on being released from my 20-###. I have an apartment-mate that has been doing nails inside of our unit. I made a complaint on ### explaining my leasing management that the chemicals being used are harmful and have had a negative effect on my breathing. On ###, after nothing was done, I submitted to my leasing office a ### compliance letter which was the first official notice requesting termination of the lease. Within those ###, the only thing they requested for her to do was to move the nail items from our common area into her bedroom. They never requested she stop using the harsh chemicals or stop the business which is a violation of the housing agreement. A follow up ### termination letter was sent as well, which their attorney responded to, denying my termination due to a high number of vacant units.  The only solution they have to solve the issue is for me to transfer apartments which I am not interested in being that they have already violated my lease and I signed for this unit. I would prefer to just terminate my lease since they have already breached the leasing agreement being that my health is at risk and housing violations were broken to their knowledge. 44103.7986111111 Ms. ###:please send a copy of lease.was she doing her nails? or others nails?44106.7027777778 Good afternoon: Moving out now will not remove the lawsuit from your credit report or the public records.  You may be able to avoid a judgment by moving out before the hearing.  However, the landlord could still proceed to obtain a judgment against you.  The question would be whether it would be worth doing so.44103.9201388889 I have a non- monetary hold over eviction hearing coming soon. I have submitted ### deceleration form Covid###. Can I move out before hearing to remove eviction filing? Or is this already on my record and just go to hearing.44103.9173611111 Good evening: I am sorry you are having difficulties with the air conditioner and feel that the response time is inadequate.  However, your description does not appear to provide you any remedy.  The response time is objectively probably reasonable. You have renewed the lease, I presume, several times since you have been there ###. That creates additional issues for you to overcome.Here's the place you need to start in order to evaluate whether the delay in response is unreasonable:  http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0###/0083/Sections/0083.56.htmlYou will note that in order to withhold rent or terminate the lease ###, not a text or an email, written and properly delivered. But no matter what else, ###.Good luck.44104.0534722222 I am a tenant at a apartment complex. I sent a text to the property management at 12:### (I have COPD so I can not be in extreme heat or cold as this will incur me to have an attack) they did not respond at ### I sent another text inquiring as to whether the AC repair man was coming they did not respond an hour later they responded that they had called the AC repair man at 6pm I sent a text asking for an eta of the repair man and was told that they did not have an eta at ###. This is the fourth time in ### ###. My question is how long do I have to wait for a repair man to be called to fix a necessity for me such as AC? Is there any action that I can take as again this is not the first time that I have had the AC fail (this is the ### time) and I am made to wait more than ###. Meanwhile I have called AC repair companies (four random companies) and was told by all of them that i could have a repairman out in ###. And yet somehow they can never get a repairman to come out the same day.  44104.0368055556 Good morning:  You ask:  Am I still fully liable even if the third party they reccommended took me off?"  I can't answer that question until you tell me:  What do you mean by "fully liable" and to whom?  If you are talking about liability to the apartment complex probably so.  If you are talking about liability to your roommates maybe not but since I wasn't furnished a copy of any documentation between you and the "third party" or you and the roommates or a copy or your lease I can't tell.You also state" is it illegal to inform my roomates..."   It is not illegal.  It may be a breach of obligations you owe to your roommates or others.  However it is not illegal.  An illegal act is a crime and from what you have reported your conduct does not appear to be criminal.   If your action causes a break in utility service for the apartment and that further causes damage or significant inconvenience to your roommates then you may have some liability for that.I'm not sure upon what basis you believe that you should not be held responsible for ###/### other than the good ### of your roommates.  Your choice to be absent did not in any manner change your responsibility.  I understand you used fewer kilowatts since you weren't present but that was a choice you made already armed with the knowledge that you were responsible for ###/###.  If you don't have the answer to your question you may supplement by answering my questions in the first paragraph.  I will leave the question open the remainder of the day for you to do so."44104.5270833333 I have an apartment with two other roommates. We all have individual leases and use a third party our apartment complex recommended for dealing with our utilities. The third party splits our utilities three way and we individually have to pay them our portion. I left my apartment in ### for a job in NY and has not been back to my apartment since. The first couple months I left I was still paying the third party utilities I realize I would be staying in NY longer than intended and ask if I can be taken of of the utility account. Which was possible only if my roommate agreed so I have text messages that they agree, plus the third party informed them and they had ###, but they did not. ( I have the documents of the messages and email)Now two months later my roommates want me to pay them money because the ac broke in August. And the apartment complex said my lease says Iâ€™m responsible for my portion of the utilities however I have documentation between the third party they recommended and messages with my roommates. So I am going to pay the fees to break my lease. Am I still fully liable even if the third party they recommended took me off ?also since I am breaking my lease, the utility ### is under my name is it illegal to inform my roommates the morning of my move out day that one of them need to create an account? ( it is going to be the morning of a business day)44104.2097222222 Based upon what you have told us--and assuming if all of it is true--you have the legal right to move out based on health reasons. However--before making any decision--you will have to decide (a) whether you want to move out or (b) you cannot move (because you said you don't have the money to just pick up and leave.")Have you called your local county health department to complain about these unsanitary conditions?    "44104.5951388889 I do not know what the City of Jacksonville/Duval County Health Department will do; call them and find out. 44104.8409722222 Thank you for responding.I have not, I didn't know I was able to contact them regarding that. When I say the money to pick up and leave, I mean the $###. (###) They have closed these holes some what, and i say somewhat due to the poor work done, and replaced the vanity. The vanity took over ###. They did not put it in correctly, so they had to come back out and cover openings in it. My faucet has still not been fixed. When I contact the health department, will they notify the apartments? Or investigate them in some way? 44104.6486111111 To be brief, I moved into an apartment complex in early March of this year. They were given initial work orders before to be completed, it took months on months to be completed. One is not to this day. They enter without calling first, they leave a trail of dirty and left over items when they come in. Then, in ### I saw a back up of black material in my bathroom sink. I emailed the office notifying them of this and asking if this is happening to anyone else. No response for ###. Until, my bathroom sink flooded my bathroom. I had to call emergency maintenance, had holes placed every where, black gunk everywhere. I was promised this work to be completed for weeks. This never happened. No one showed any regard for my property or my convenience. They left gunk everywhere, holes in my walls open, a water damaged vanity that wasn't replaced for months. They state their corporate requires a written letter for them to speak to anyone. I found an open, dirty razor they left in my bathroom, emailed them and received no acknowledgment of this. My faucet recently began leaking, i emailed and placed work orders, and it is not complete. To this day, I face ignored emails, promises that aren't true, and a complete disregard for my well being and comfort. I'm emotionally drained by this whole process. I don't have to money to just pick up and leave, but what they're doing isn't right. If i could just make them see how wrong they are treating me and potentially other tenants, maybe they'd sell their contract and get someone who actually knows what their doing.I am looking to get out of my lease hopefully without having to pay a lump sum of money, or anything at all. I have plenty of pictures.Any advice is appreciated.44104.5243055556 ###.  If you have a written lease that has monthly payments paid to the OWNER, the OWNER should give you ###.###.  If you do not have a lease the OWNER should give you a fifteen day notice to vacate. ###.  However, since the Condo Association is NOT the OWNER or your landlord none of the above apply; and they can evict you at any time.   44104.7215277778 My family is renting a condo from a private owner, but the unit is under HOA regulations. We moved from out-of-state and have been staying with them for the past ### (including our pitbull). The owner informed us that although he has no issue with it, the pitbull is against HOA rules and we need to move. We have a house that we are going to move into; however, it is not available until ###st. Now the HOA is threatening to call the police for breaking the rules and telling us that we need to move immediately. Can they HOA legally evict us during the pandemic? 44104.55 Thank you for the response. Are they required to issue a written eviction notice? Because there has been no written notice.44104.6361111111 Yes they ### will. Why?Because the pandemic tenant protection clause contained in the CARES Act expired on ### and the Senate has ### refused to re-enact it; playing ###. Bottom line: Unless you vacate the condo--or put your pit bull somewhere ### will be kicked to the curb along with all your belongings.    44104.5763888889 Good morning: Your problems are not really landlord/tenant issues. They are family law issues. You can sue in small claims court for any money you believe you are owed by her, but it's likely that a good defense by her would be that the proper place to resolve the issues you raise is divorce court which would cause you to have to start over.  You have a proof problem as well.  However, if you have text messages in which she agrees to payment and the amount you may be to overcome those.Good luck.44104.5895833333 I purchased my home in 20###7. I met my current wife September of 20###8. She was living in ### and was in a rental contract there. We got married in October of 20###8. Very quick I know. Her rent was ### ###. Well she wanted to move from where she was renting to my house so that her rent would be cut from ### ###. Well December of ###. She never gave notice or payed the last month she was there she just up and moved with ###. Well she moved in to my house and she has refused to pay her rent. Itâ€™s been almost ### ###. I have text messages where she agreed to pay half as well as video where she stated that she knows she agreed to pay rent when she moved here after breaking her last rental agreement with her previous landlord. She says that since we are married she doesnâ€™t have to pay and if the home is foreclosed on it donâ€™t affect her. We were living in separate places when we got married. I bought my home before I even met her. Do I have any legal options to get the past due rent that is now over 6,000? And thatâ€™s just what she owes. I feel taken advantage by her. She also went online to get a duplicate copy of my Drivers License to put me on her checking account and then fraudulently cashed two of my checks that totaled over ###,### ###. Which is over ###. She refuses to pay the credit card or repay the checks she cashed that were sent to me before we got married. I know I can take her to court for the checks and credit card but what can I do about the back rent?44104.58125 I am very sorry to hear about the terrible treatment you received from your former landlord and the unexplained difficulty you are still having with your former employer about back pay owed and the unexplained difficulty you apparently are still having trying to collect unemployment benefits due from the Florida DEO. However, this wonderful new Florida Bar website is not the place to raise all of these horrendous claims because the volunteer lawyers responding here cannot help you solve all of these problems here on this website. Here is the preliminary advice I give to all potential clients who raise possible housing discrimination claims followed by advice about employment discrimination claims: If you feel you have been discriminated against by actions of your landlord because of your race age gender (including sexual harassment) sexual orientation or national origin religion or marital status or because you have a disability or feel you have been retaliated against for speaking out or asserting your legal rights. you should contact the Florida Commission on Human Relations (###) here in ###. The ###'s toll free telephone number is (800) ### ###; or you can call them at (850) ### ###. If you do call ask to speak with an Intake Counselor. You do not need a lawyer; but retaining one before you file a charge of discrimination will help get through the bureaucracy."  "If you feel you have been discriminated against because of your race gender national origin or because have a disability or feel you have been retaliated against for speaking out or asserting your legal rights in the workplace you should contact the Florida Commission on Human Relations (###) here in ###. The ###'s toll free telephone number is (800) ### ###; or you can call them at (850) ### ###. If you do call ask to speak with an Intake Counselor. IMPORTANT: You do not need a lawyer to file an ### case; but retaining one to advise you BEFORE you file a Charge of Discrimination at ### will help get through the bureaucracy much easier and faster. (Note: Advisory legal fees are usually much lower than representation fees; and many are on a flat fee basis. So be sure to ask the lawyers you call how much they will charge just to advise you as you go through the ### process.)"       "44105.6090277778 I lost both jobs due to COVID-### ###th. I did not receive a dollar of unemployment until ### (im still owed those ###). My complex broke down ### rent into ### $###. I paid May, ### and July.

When I tried to contact them one time via email about my money situation they responded with â€œwe cannot speak to you without your lawyerâ€ (??) they kicked me off the online portal where I can see all my service requests and what I owed at the beginning of August. They refused to take partial payment on the one month I owed. They have emailed since they told me they canâ€™t speak to me without my lawyer telling me I had to tell them what was going on or my charges would keep increasing. They have bullied me, filed a false eviction, and forced me to live in black mold that I have tons of proof of that they caused by their own negligence. I was almost homeless because the eviction they filed kept ### up when I applied for a new home. 44105.0527777778 My question is actually are they allowed to evict with all the covid laws in place? 44105.6166666667 Yes.

What actions can i take to get my things back, or money to replace them? 44105.7715277778 Hello there.  My advice is to wait for the ###.  If she has not sent you the certified letter with details as to what the deductions are for, she then loses the right to a claim for your deposit.  She could still independently file a lawsuit for the claimed damages, but she would have to win her case and could not keep the deposit.  Here is a link to the ### Clerk of Court page:https://www.###clerk.com/court-services/small-claims You would need to file a Statement of Claim form.  You would state that she failed to comply with the statute you listed in your demand letter, and that you're entitled to a refund of your full deposit.  You may be able to get an attorney to handle this for you, because the statute would require her to pay for your filing fee AND a reasonable attorney's fee.  If she does send a certified letter within the ###, you then have ###.  Then you would have to file suit to recover, but again, the prevailing party would be entitled to attorney's fees.The filing fee is determined by each county's clerk of court.  When you file, you'll need to have the landlord's address, as there is an additional fee for the court to create and serve a summons on the landlord.  The sheriff's office will take care of serving her with a court date, as well as your Statement of Claim.  Also, make sure you bring ###, one for the court and one for the defendant.Take a look at that link, it has information about how to file, and also has a PDF of the Statement of Claim form.### ###, Esq.JA Law44105.8763888889 I moved from a home at ### ###. My landlady did not send me any written information about why she had not returned my full deposit- ### $###, pet fee of $### ######. I followed her list of instructions, I followed the parameters of the lease, I was not late nor owed any rent (I even paid her for the ###), but she still kept $2000+ of my deposit. she sent me $###. I received it ###.There are two items I did damage-- the small plastic holder on the stove door and the slider for the cheese ### in the fridge. I told her these were worth $###.I received an email with hand written notes about what was wrong with home and cost to repair (her estimate), at 11:### ### ###. I never received a certified letter as per statute nor any formal estimate for any work. All handwritten email or texts at the last moment.We also spoke on the phone. I told her I disagreed with everything she was claiming. She told me she was upset but that all the things that were wrong are not your issue (black mold from central air unit that needed to be replaced, electrical issues, bug infestation on ### shutters). She said they were outside the normal wear and tear and yet she charged me more than $###. My pet is an ###. She is also remodeling the kitchen this week which tells me she is using my money to pay for it. I left the home clean. I sent her a demand letter on ### with photos explaining that I disputed these charges and demanded the balance of my deposit be paid to me by ###. My handyman can attest to the condition of the home and the work we did on it. he also believes she is way out of line and stealing my money.I sent it certified mail on Wednesday ###. she has not responded. I told her if I did not get it I would file a claim in small claims court. she is holding my money for items that are not my responsibility to pay nor did I damage them in any way. She told me repeatedly how great a tenant I was.I can't figure out what form to file, in what court, and what is cost. The fl court website is very confusing. I need to know the steps and what I need to do. It says something about paying the sheriff to serve her and making sure I file in the right court. need clear direction or help in filing. I am attaching the lease and the demand letter with all photos.44105.8340277778 Please let me know what to do about the check I have. the ###. I would cash it thursday and at the same time, file a claim for the remaining $###. Can I claim twice the damages plus attorney's fees if I can find an attorney? this is what I need to know before filing as the money is sitting here since ### and I need it. I don't know if she would pay even if the judgement came to me and there is the matter of waiting 60+ days to even have a court date. she is banking on me just cahsing it and keeping my balance and that is so unfair.44110.7590277778 Sorry about that, thanks for getting back to me.  I've seen conflicting information on cashing the check.  Some attorneys caution against it, but others say that that cashing the check, even with the note, does not prevent you from going after her for not complying with the certified letter requirement.  There is no guarantee, but my legal opinion is that you can cash the check and file suit for the remainder.  Her writing on the check that it's for full satisfaction of the deposit is not necessarily a legally binding statement.  That's a ### slope that I don't think the court would allow, because it would mean that anyone can send partial payment and put a satisfaction/accord clause and be off the hook for the remainder owed if someone cashed it.  I would caution you, however, that a Judge could possibly see otherwise.  The only way to guarantee a claim for the full amount would be not depositing the check.  I would recommend that you speak to a local attorney, the attorney's fee provision should make it no problem for you to find someone to take the case, and see whether he or she thinks you should deposit the check as part of how they plan to handle your case.  As far as double damages, I don't believe the statute allows for that.  The only circumstance I'm aware of that allows for doubling is a holdover tenant who refuses to leave after a lease expires, and the landlord can charge double rent until the holdover tenant is removed.44110.7805555556 Yes, wait until the ###.  You can file day ###.  The question about the check is a tricky one, let me get back to you on that.44106.0416666667 thank you.just to be clear.

In ###/married ### ### ###, and did not have any interest in the property leaving it the sole responsibility of Godric ### (my dad). If so who do I argue this with?44110.875 If you mean that if you loaned your father money without getting a mortgage could you put a valid lien against his homestead property the answer is no.Also, even if it is not his homestead property he only has a half interest in the property, so at best you could get a half interest, which you already have from the quit claim deed.44108.3361111111 No if she was married her husband would be entitled to all or part of her half interest depending on the laws of intestacy in effect at the time of her death, unless she had a will.44107.9173611111 Okay, so since your parents were not married and the property was not titled with right of survivorship, it meant that when your mother died she had a half interest in the property which did not go to your father.It would go to to her children at the time of her death, and will require that it be probated.Your father's deed would give you the other half.You should find a probate lawyer to probate your mother's interest in the property.How many children did she have?44107.9013888889 You wrote here for a legal answer.When your mother died she was not married to your father, common law or civil marriage. She was on the deed, so her estate had a half interest when she died and that ###.44110.9076388889 Your mother's half interest would go to the two of you.44107.9104166667 even if she had gotten married when she was deceased it will still only go to myself and my brother?So I will need my brother to sign off on his portion which would be the 25% of the property?I will need the probate lawyer to prove that ### ### ### is one in the same person as the death certificate and the deed will then be retitled to myself, my dad, and my brother? and at that time get my brother to sign off on his portion?44107.9145833333 i purchased a property from my father via quit claim deed my mother who is deceased is also on the deed however on the deed she signed my father's last name which was never legally her last name I have the death certificate and at the time of her death she had married someone else.

Yes. ###000652.  Withholding rent for legitimate reasons (like not having hot water) is legal if the correct court forms are used properly. ###.  Late fees are not rent and cannot be withheld like rent can. ###.  Your entitlement to withhold rent ended the day the reason for allowing you to do it ceased--i.e. the day the landlord fixed the hater heater.5.  Final advice: Start paying rent; and try to work a deal to pay the late fees over the remaining lease ###, so you will be current the day you leave.###:  Florida law allows landlords to refuse to rent to tenants who were evicted from another place. You DO NOT want that to happen to you.     44109.7020833333 Even late fees ### with the months that we gave them the form for ### rent? 44109.6770833333 Good afternoon, we have currently been withholding rent since ###th due to the water heater not being fixed and causing us an extra $100-$###; This problem has been going on since February (electric company has confirmed). we sent the property a ### rent form due to this problem not being fixed (not fixed after the ###'t know if its really fixed). They want to charge a $###, even though we sent the proper forms sent by the clerk of courts to with-hold rent. Do they have the right to charge the late fees even though we sent them the forms of ### rent due to negligence? Also do we have the right to terminate our lease? They did not fix it after the ### period and its been going on for 6-###. Also if we terminate lease do we have to pay them all the rent we have been ###? Thank you! (The file below shows the late fee charges only for August and September so far, October will be added tomorrow.)44108.1583333333 Rather than explaining Florida law to you I will cut to the chase:###.  Since the reason you were given a forbearance was because the water heater did not work.###.  Since you said the water heater has been repaired you cannot continue withholding rent any longer.###.  Unless you start paying rent again you will be evicted for non-payment of rent.###.  If that happens you will be liable to the landlord for any back rent you did not pay.5.  You will also be liable for all late fees charged each month that you do not pay rent on time. 6.  Advice: Either start paying rent again and make a side deal with the landlord as to how to pay everything else you owe; or7.  Get ready to move. P.S. You have no legal basis to terminate the lease early because the water heater works.   44109.5972222222 ###.

To do a partition action without an experience attorney will require a lot of in depth research and self-education on your part.  You may have to go to the law library in your county.  Most counties have law libraries associated with the courthouse. 44111.3527777778 I own a home with a co-owner, who moved out in ###.

I would like to sell the house but the co-owner is not responding to any attempts for communication.  I have sent her letters, emails and left voicemails.  I would like to file a partition case to get the courts to approve the sale of the home.  I do not have enough money to pay for a lawyer, which I was told could be thousands of dollars.  If I am unable to sell the home, it will go into foreclosure by early 2021.  Please, please assist with the steps I need to take to begin the process of filing the partition case.  I have been unsuccessful in finding the exact steps for filing the partition with the court.   44110.9222222222 I would hope you could do it in a few months. I have practiced real estate law for ###,but new had to do a partition action so I don't know how long they take and Covid makes everything take longer.Be aware that a successful partition action causes a forced judicial sale and that properties are not likely to sell for their actual market value in a forced judicial sale.44111.7215277778 Thank you for the response.

It's highly unlikely there is any clause in the lease that would allow you to vacate early due to a medical condition.Whether the landlord would sue you to recover unpaid rent minus any amount they obtain by re-renting the apt is hard to predict.44113.3847222222 ###.

There is way to much confidential stuff to unpack and discuss here on this very public website. And from what you have told us you are in desperate need of immediate advice from an experienced banking lawyer who has ### foreclosure suits before. ### A ###, Esq.  ###44111.88125 Hello there.  While criminal cases have specific statutory rules to expunge them, there is no set forth procedure for sealing a civil case.  It is totally at the discretion of the judge.  You would need to file a Motion to seal the cases.  The basis has to be that there's a need for confidentiality, and that it's causing undue harm.  In your case, it appears to be causing undue harm, as you're unable to find housing.  Additionally, both filings were later abandoned, so there was never an adverse finding against you.  Filing that Motion that having a hearing in front of a judge would be the way to seal.### ###, Esq.JA Law44111.9777777778 It's always recommended that you get an attorney.  However, in theory, you could try to do this one yourself if needed.  This isn't likely to be contested, but if the state doesn't agree that your record should be sealed, they could have a representative opposing you.  I don't think that this would happen in your case.  If you want to file it yourself, look up the format for a civil complaint in ### (17th judicial circuit) and use the same heading.  Then, you add your title of Petition to ###, and in the body you would type the justification, as explained in the first email.  Once complete, you would file it with the clerk of court, and they would likely just set it for hearing.  List the Plaintiff as the State of Florida, and list yourself as the Defendant.###44113.4972222222 Thank you for the information, how do I go about filing a motion to seal a case? Do I need a lawyer to represent me or is this something I can do myself ?44112 my family and i have been living at our current rental residence for almost 6yrs,and we were recently given a notice of non renewal. after searching and finding a few locations that we liked we decided to apply (for a fee) for a lease, and each time we have been denied. we were given a copy of the denial letter that states the reason for denial is eviction. after searching through public records we became aware that our currently rental property filed an eviction against twice in the ###. both filings states dismissed without hearing and we were never made aware that we had this on our public record. is there a possibility we can have these filings removed or sealed being that its just a filing, and we were never evicted. this is a major issue because i am being denied housing, and only have a few days left before my lease expires. we have no where to go at this point.44111.9277777778 I signed a lease in October of 2018.

The place calls itself a hotel instead of an apartment, although there is nothing hotel" about it... I have been late on my rent quite often since I moved here and I moved here because I am new to town... Anyway the owner of the establishment has started telling me the he is going to kick my door in and throw my stuff on the streets recently.. He has nothing nice to say to me anymore. My anxiety is already bad but I have literally lost a job because I was so nervous about what was gonna happen if I didn't get a certain amount paid to him that day. And it's always a different amount. So today I have paid him $###'s moving me out in the morning if I don't have the other $70. A couple other things... The alternator on my car went out ###. I asked him to check the cameras and he basically told me it wasn't a priority. Also  the room I rent doesn't even have a window which I know is illegal. And I have asked him to give me a different room. I need to know what my rights actually are since he rents as a hotel I'm pretty sure it's different then the basic ### laws. "43436.9722222222 Ms. ###,From what you have written, it does not appear that you have a landlord-tenant relationship.  The Missouri statute which most likely applies is as follows: ######5.075.  Hotel operator may eject person, when. â€” An owner or operator of a hotel may eject a person from the hotel and notify the appropriate local law enforcement authorities for any of the following reasons:â€ƒ (###)  Nonpayment of charges incurred by the individual renting or leasing a room, accommodations or facilities of the hotel when the charges are due and owing;â€ƒ (###)  The individual renting or leasing a room, accommodations or facilities of the hotel is visibly intoxicated, under the influence of alcohol or other drug and is disorderly so as to create a public nuisance;â€ƒ (###)  The owner or operator reasonably believes that the individual is using the premises for an unlawful purpose;â€ƒ (###)  The owner or operator reasonably believes that the individual has brought something into the hotel which may create an unreasonable danger or risk to other persons, including but not limited to unlawful use of firearms or explosives; andâ€ƒ (5)  The individual is in violation of any federal, state or local laws or regulations relating to the hotel.Â­(L. ###.B. 5TERM0006###)Even if you could pay, it does not sound like a good living situation and you might be better off staying with friends or family until you can afford to actually rent an apartment or home. The cost of hiring an attorney to research whether or not your unit might be improperly classified as a hotel is probably beyond your means.  Some Legal Aid offices do limited work in landlord-tenant related cases, so you might want to contact your local legal aid.Best wishes.43439.1402777778 You might also wish to check with the State of Missouri to determine if the facility is required to be licensed.

There was also black mold all over the bathroom. Again we reported it and they never did anything about that either. The wall our bed was against had a constant water leak.

They do not live in the house for over ###-###. She was suppose to serve me with papers on this but I still have not received any. My question is should I call and tell them I am still waiting to be served? Call the court house? Wait and hope I get the served papers? I do not want to loose my rights to the home if possible. She does not want to share anything from it she states it is all hers. Thank you. She gave a address I have never even lived at and had she not stated I was to be served I never would have known about it. 43438.025 You need to consult with an attorney in Iowa who can determine the status of the case.  It is possible that service was made by publication of notice.  You would want to retain a local attorney who practices in the particular court where this case is pending.  Calling the courthouse or a sheriff will not be of any use to you.  You need an attorney.43440.1944444444 I live in a duplex and have for over a year now. I have never had a water ### and cannot have water services provided to my address according to the utility company because both my apartment and the one above mine are on the same water meter. Recently the property was sold to a new landlord and the tenants above me moved out. My water has been shut off twice and he has threatened to not turn it back on unless I pay his ridiculously high water fee. The landlord refuses to give me a utility ### to justify the amount or the rate he is charging. Is there anything I can do? Is it legal to apply charges to my rent that were not agreed on or shut off my water? 43439.8229166667 Ms. Hill,Do you have a written lease?  If so, does the lease set forth responsibility for utilities (such as water)? Generally speaking, the ###s of your tenancy would be the same as they were with the previous owner. If you are on a month-to-month tenancy, and the agreement with the previous owner was that water was provided, this ### would remain the same when the property was ### the landlord has notified you properly of a change in the ###s of the tenancy.  I don't know if the new landlord has given you any written notice of a change in the ###s of the oral lease or not.You may need to retain an attorney to deal with the landlord if you cannot amicably resolve this yourself.   It's probably not a clear cut situation if you have no written lease, and might even need to be resolved in court.However if you are in fact on a month-to-month tenancy, you have no protection if the landlord wishes to give you notice and elects to ###inate your lease.You can utilize the Missouri Bar attorney search function to find a local landlord-tenant attorney for advice and representation if needed.  The link is:  http://missourilawyershelp.org/find-lawyer/If you cannot resolve this on a mutually agreed upon basis with the new owner, it might be time for you to give notice and ###inate the tenancy.  From your description it seem possible that this will continue to be a difficult rental situation in the future.Best wishes.43440.2104166667 I fell behind on rent and was taken to court. The ### is for my landlord. I always pay my rent online through portal, but my portal suddenly has a block on it and has had for at least a week so I can't use it. I called and told property management company that I can pay everything I owe in full on a credit card, it states on portal website page that they accept credit card payments up to $###, but they won't accept credit card from me, told me it has to be cashier's check or money order. Because of this they are sending the Sheriff to give me a ### notice to vacate. I'm disabled, and have no place else to go. Will be homeless and wont last on the streets in the cold. 43442.5354166667 Ms. ###,I am assuming this is the court case involved:  ### - ### REAL ESTATE LLC V ### ###You agreed to a consent judgment for possession (and back rent and other amounts).  You therefore owe the amount of the judgment AND need to move out.   A copy of the judgment is attached.It does not matter if you now pay the amounts due under the judgment.  The landlord has a judgment for POSSESSION of the premises.  This means you need to vacate or the Sheriff's office will move you & your things out.The court has already issued an order to the Sheriff to move your things out and bar you from entering the property.  A copy of the Sheriff's execution order dated ### is also attached. I wish I had something to suggest, but it will probably be of no value to hire an attorney now.  You agreed to a judgment which is now final.  You could contact your local Legal Aid office, but even if they can offer some assistance it may not help you.  You are about to be evicted.All I can suggest is that you do everything possible to seek assistance from friends, family, social service agencies, etc. to relocate before the Sheriff's office arrives to move you out involuntarily.  You no longer have any right to be in the rental unit.43443.13125 Duplicate question.43443.1138888889 I fell behind on rent and was taken to court. The ### is for my landlord.

I live in this camper and the landlord wishes to raise the rent significantly from ###- ###. Which would be way outside of my price range. Furthermore I have not violated the lease at all. I just found out today that the landlords business may fold. I want to know what my options are in both of these upcoming scenarios. Mostly how do I approach the landlord when it will play out soon?43443.9006944444 Here is the problem. I haven't lived in Missouri for almost ###. I own property that my father looked after (no power of attorney or anything). My father passed away this year. There are ### living on my land and in the mobile home on the land trying to say that there is a rent to own contract that was from my father when he was alive. I never authorized a rent to own on my land. The man in question who is at the head of all of this, states he put money in to fix up the mobile home, which i also did not authorize. He has receipts from my dad showing he paid my dad money for my property. ### man also has a contract for rent to purchase of the land and trailer. It has my name signed to it. The signature is NOT mine. Again, let me make it clear, i did not authorize the selling of the land and there was no power of attorney. Being i do not live in Missouri anymore and am quite pregnant, how do i get these people off of my land? The police will not do anything. I have called already. Being i am close to ###, i cannot travel the ###. I tried to designate my cousin as a temporary power of attorney to handle matters for me but he was told by the courthouse that this wasn't allowed. What can i do?43445.3645833333 If you have properly designated your cousin with power of attorney there is no reason why he cannot act for you but he will not be able file suit to get these folks out of the property.  That will either require you to appear personally or you must hire an attorney.As to the underlying case you will need to file suit to evict these folks and challenge the legal authority of your father to sign away your rights to the property.  If you actually gave your father power of attorney it is possible that his entering into this agreement with these folks is perfectly legal and enforceable.  That is precisely what a power of attorney is for - to enable another to legally act on your behalf.  You could pursue something against your late father's estate for possibly acting beyond his authority but that likely would not help you with the case against these folks.Bottom line, you cannot really do anything about this without hiring a Missouri attorney to address this for you.43445.6020833333 I make about 20,###.

Please help! Thank you! ### ### 43445.8486111111 Ms ###,I would recommend you at least have an in-person consultation with a local attorney, who can review all of the documents involved and any possible Section ###.  It would also be good to have some advice on what to do if you move from the unit.  You need to be sure you are actually being released from further obligation on the lease.  You may be able to get advice from your local legal aid office, as some handle limited landlord-tenant issues.  Breaking a lease has consequences.However generally speaking, you signed a lease with the landlord. This is a binding contract.  Whether or not you ended up being eligible for government assistance to help you pay your rent is not usually the landlord's problem -- unless there is something specific in the terms of the lease which makes it contingent on your approval for public housing assistance.The likelihood is that your failure to qualify for benefits is your problem, not the landlord's.

Therefore, you have an opportunity to pay. Most likely, the creditor would prefer that you pay and took action to protect its interests.  If it were to wait too long, it would miss the deadline to file the lien.  Figure out a (legal) way to get the debt paid off because it will be very frightening for you if a lawsuit gets filed. 43450.1791666667 My husband and I worked as general contractors for several years. We established a business charge account with our local lumber yard in order to create customer charge accounts. This past year, business became very slow and we got behind on paying our account with the lumber yard. Even though they have been receiving a monthly payment from us of $500, we still owe roughly $6,000. The $6,### ###. One is for a customer of ours and the other is our personal account. The money that ### has been receiving has been being applied to our customer's account. Until that account is paid in full, our personal account will remain inactive and have no ### applied to it.

In the paperwork that we received from ### lawyers, neither a due date, nor a court date, were established.

My question is, can they foreclose on our property before we have the opportunity to pay off the debt? 43448.1361111111 Basically my landlord let me know on short notice that I need to relocate for six to eight weeks she only gave me two weeks notice and she told me the building was for sale but never let me knew that it was sold. 43448.7152777778 Come to find out there was never a. ### permit done she never came and fixed nothing and now it's like I have nowhere to go and she just expects me to have something figured out within ###43448.7159722222 Ms. ###,If your real estate has already been sold at a foreclosure sale, you need to deal with the new owner.  If your name was on the deed and you left your property in the house, I don't see how your husband would be responsible to you.  As an owner, many notices of the foreclosure would have been sent to you at the property address.  If you did not already do so, you should put in a mail forwarding order with the USPS.But once the foreclosure sale has occurred, neither you nor your husband has the right to reenter the property. It appears you have already filed for a dissolution of your marriage in ### - ### ### V ### ### and that you are represented by attorney ### ###.

It's not clear this has happened.  But when a rent and possession lawsuit is filed, service can be obtained by posting the summons/petition on door to the property.

The new owner is bound by the terms of your existing lease. If you and the new landlord work out an agreement under which you will temporarily move from the property and be adequately compensated to your satisfaction, this absolutely must be reduced to a WRITTEN agreement mutually modifying the existing lease.

As an illegal subletter, you would not normally receive any notice of the pending court eviction proceedings.

I will try and be brief. I was trying to sell my property. The guy I was seeing at the time told me about his co-workers daughter that just got her real estate license. I hired her to sell my property. First time my property was under contract the realtor told me to leave the guy who introduced us out of fixing or helping me to try and get more money out of my property out of the picture because the property was under contract. The guy who was a plumber and someone I was seeing split up. I still continued to keep the realtor. Well that sell fell thru. In early ######, the realtor had found another buyer. Price was dropped considerable lower an I signed the contract. Asking the realtor how come the earnest money was only ###. She said that was normal. Within a week of closing she added another person onto the contract. Once again telling me it was normal. I was becoming more concerned about the realtor and the sell of the property. I contacted the realtor on a ### before the sell asking about the final walkthrough. She did not respond to my text until the day before I was to sell the house. The walkthrough was supposed to be Sunday, the house closed on Monday. I texted Sunday she said I was not allowed at the walkthrough it was between the realtor and the buyer. Briefly after that the potential buyer showed up at my residence an was very persistent about wanting to do work that day. I said no!

There are and have been a multitude of class actions involving mortgage servicers.  If you do an internet search for Ocwen class action" you will find links to many of them.   But your urgent problem is the foreclosure.  Regardless of whether or not you might be a member of a class action if you are delinquent in your mortgage payments the foreclosure will proceed.  Being a member of a class action is not going to prevent the foreclosure.  I would not count on any possible class action as a solution to your situation.I don't know if Beyond Housing assists people in your area but you can check.  Link to site:  ###If your foreclosure sale is scheduled for ### then a Chapter ###.   Obviously I don't know if you would qualify to file under Chapter 13 and other details such as the amount of the delinquency and the equity you have in the property.  I suggest you meet with an attorney as soon as possible to determine if a Chapter ### (or some other option) would be available to you to stop the foreclosure.  An analysis of your financial situation is beyond the scope of this ### forum. The Missouri Bar web site has a search function for attorneys which may be useful to you.  The link is:  http://missourilawyershelp.org/find-lawyer/I recommend you both contact Beyond Housing and see an attorney as soon as possible next week.

I'm sorry you're in the middle of this situation and that your brother is acting the way he is.First, I'd try calling the police to see if they will do anything.  My guess is they probably won't do anything and will tell you it's a civil matter."  Nevertheless it can't hurt to try.  If brother refuses to give you what is yours your only option would be to file a Replevin lawsuit against him.  Replevin is the type of lawsuit that's filed when someone has possession of property belonging to you and is refusing to return it.  In the Replevin lawsuit you can ask that the Court order that the property be returned and that that money damages be assessed against the other party for wrongfully withholding the property.  That lawsuit would need to be filed in the local State Court in the County where your property is located.  Those can be complicated lawsuits and I'd strongly encourage you to retain an attorney to handle this on your behalf.  Unfortunately there are no ### forms for this type of lawsuit.I hope this helps but if you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reply to this message.###"43472.8263888889 FactsMom and Dad married  when I was age four and brother ten.

Iâ€™ve rented from him for over ###. After renewing my lease I get a knock on the door from a male with legal papers at my door looking for my landlord to serve him papers. He didnâ€™t give me any info but did tell me it was regarding this property and to have my landlord give him a call. I instantly freaked out and called my landlord. He told me I had nothing to worry about and just tell the person that Iâ€™m a renter and he would call me later but my landlord never called me back. After freaking out I went online and seen that there was a judgment on this property so I called an attorney for a free consultation and he told me that after reviewing casenet that he advised me to move immediately. There was an order of eviction against my landlord and he was behind thousands of dollars on unpaid HOA fees. He havenâ€™t paid since 2007. I was forced to find somewhere for me and my family to move to which caused stress, time off work and having to come up with money to move(moving truck) and 1st and last month deposit fees plus application fees. My landlord thought this was funny and cracked ### saying be thankful I didnâ€™t have to move in the middle of the winter. He harassed me constantly, sending me threatening text messages and gave me the hardest time with getting my security deposit back. I just let have the deposit because at this point I was so upset and frustrated. After contacting my hazelwood city ### to obtain my occupancy permit for my new home I found out that my old rental home was never inspected prior to me and my daughter moving in which means we ### been exposed to mold, electrical fires, lead etc. I would truly appreciate if someone could help me go after my landlord. I would truly appreciate it. I also just found out he is behind over $### in unpaid HOA fees and is currently being garnished. He now has a new tenant living in the property and Iâ€™m pretty sure he didnâ€™t get the property inspected bc he has an hold on his account from the county of hazelwood department. That was told to me when I got my occupancy permit. THANK YOU.43474.7819444444 Ms. ###,If I understand correctly, you moved into the property without having first obtained an occupancy permit, and then lived there without an occupancy permit for over three years.  Under ### code, the tenant is required to apply for and obtain an occupancy permit.  If you had applied for your occupancy permit, that would have triggered a code inspection. Regardless, you decided to move out because you mistakenly feared you would be evicted as a result of the second HOA judgment in ###, 2018.  There was also a prior judgment for unpaid HOA fees from 2012.   Clearly the HOA has and had no intention of evicting a tenant, as it has not done so and is in fact attempting to collect the second judgment by an execution and garnishment against the present tenant.  This garnishment is attempting to attach any rent due from the present tenant to the owner. I don't know about the advice you received causing you to panic and move, or if you understood it completely or correctly.  But the homeowner's association would almost certainly not have attempted to have the Sheriff evict a tenant in your circumstances based on the ###.  The petition and summons were served on Mr. ### in ###, MO. and apparently not served upon you. The HOA did not sue you a ### Doe" tenant.  The judgment for possession has not been enforced and the purpose was for leverage to get Mr. ### to make payments.  There is and was no reason for the HOA to try to cause the property to become vacant.  The possession judgment has not been enforced probably is not enforceable against a tenant and is just an empty threat to get Mr. ### to pay.Did you or your attorney contact the lawyer for the HOA before you decided to move out?  I'm guessing you did not or you would have discovered that there was no intent to do a Sheriff's execution against you as a tenant based on the judgment.  The HOA would probably have been required to file an unlawful detainer or other action against you and to try to obtain a judgment against you for possession before taking any action to remove you from the premises.  Your lease with the owner may have been a v###d defense against such a suit.  You very well could still be living there if you wanted to stay.The fact that you decided to move in without an occupancy permit (and occupancy inspection) really is irrelevant however.  You suffered no damages from this.  Without seeing the lease I cannot determine if the lease was conditioned upon an occupancy permit or not.You made the decision to move out during your lease perhaps unnecessarily.  I doubt there was actually any real need for you to move.  But by choosing to move you removed the risk even if it was extremely remote that the HOA would request a Sheriff's execution to remove you based on the ###.  You might very well have had a lawsuit against the HOA if they had the Sheriff remove you and your property from the premises.  For this reason and because removing a tenant would be ### even if the HOA had the right your emergency move was probably unnecessary.It would not be appropriate for an attorney on this forum to give you a definitive opinion on the value of a possible claim against your former landlord.  It is not a substitute for hiring an attorney.  You would need to retain an attorney for advice and possible representation.   You might have a claim for your security deposit and any prepaid rent not used.  The cost of an attorney might not be worth it.  There are also the complications discussed above (you moved in without an occupancy permit and panicked and moved out).  You could be hit with a counterclaim from your landlord for lost rent and damages to the property.  The same risks would apply if you file a small claims case but at least you would not incur your own attorney's fees.  I suggest you have a full consultation with an attorney -- in person.  The attorney can review the documents involved (lease notice you gave to terminate the lease proof that you we current in your rent payments communications (e-mail correspondence texts etc.) with the landlord and the HOA and the attorney with whom you consulted before and after photos of the premises etc. After a full evaluation from your attorney you can decide if you have a worthwhile claim and if so whether to pay an attorney or file a small claims case pro se.  One added consideration is that even if you are able to obtain a judgment it may never be collectible.  Note that the HOA has still not been able to collect anything at all against  either the ### ###. ###.

Since there is no house for a move-out walk through" that would allow them to deduct for repairs or damage beyond "normal wear and tear"?They did send us a text message at the end of November stating they believed we had "abandoned the property" and they would be coming by the property to inspect it. No one ever showed or if they did they saw that we were still very much living in the residence."43483.9236111111 I think that depends on what your lease says. The lease might spell out what circumstances give rise to the return (or lack thereof) of the deposit. If itâ€™s silent to this aspect, yes, I believe you are entitled to its return. The difficult part is whether or not you want to pay a lawyer $###50-$300/hr to fight over $###. While I believe the law protects you, the economics may not warrant fighting in court over it. You could easily run up $###-### $###. Do your best advocating for yourself, but at the end of the day, it may be more financially advantageous to just cut your losses.

I think if you called them, they may be able to have a very nice conversation with you about options.43484.0243055556 In ###15, my husband and I rented a house at $###.###. We gave the landlord $###. For the first and last monthsâ€™ rent and the security deposit. It was a 12-month lease that expired ###. The landlord offered to let us make repairs and address maintenance issues in exchange for rent. We submitted records of the work we did, including time spent, receipts for parts and expenses we incurred. The landlord then discounted our rent equal to the amounts we submitted. There were several issues that were beyond our knowledge and ability to fix including electrical wiring issues, structural problems, central a/c that was non-functioning and many city code violations that had not been corrected. The landlord promised he would address these issues; to no avail. In spite of these problems, we agreed to renew our lease the next year and the year after that. Our current lease was set to expire ###. In ######, the landlord contacted us to inform us that there would be contractorsâ€™ coming by to give him estimates to make the needed repairs and to get the house up to code.  ###, no work was done. In ### new owner" to manage the property. The letter stated that they had received our "Notice to Vacate" and that we needed to schedule a walk through prior to our move out date of ###. We contacted them immediately and informed them that we had a lease. They made us produce a copy of our lease which we did. From TERM000###8 until November we paid our rent to Blue ###. They sent us a letter in November informing us our lease would expire ### and we needed to vacate by ###.  We contacted them and told them we assumed our December rent was paid and we would expect our deposit returned to us. They informed us we would have to â€œtake it upâ€ with the previous owner because they were not obligated to those terms. On ### the house caught fire from a generator that was running in the backyard. The house was a total loss including all of our possessions. While retrieving my dogs from the upstairs bedroom when I was coming down the stairs I fell breaking my right ankle and tearing ###. We have been displaced since ###. Blue ### says we owe them for ###â€™ rent a total of $###. They still will not honor our deposit or last month paid rent. Do we owe them? And/or do they owe us? Are they responsible for the injury I received from the fall during the fire? There was no power or smoke detectors anywhere in the house at the time of the fire."43482.7868055556 No you should not owe for your last months rent, particularly if the property was uninhabitable due to fire for the entire month. I would get a complete payment history of your rent payments - the property management company should have it. Then you can obtain your own bank records to verify the record is accurate and determine if they are alleging that you had any unpaid rent from previous months where you occupied the property. While Blue ### may not be liable for your injuries, your landlord may be. You need to speak with a personal injury attorney about a potential lawsuit for your injuries and if you are sued in a landlord/tenant action, I highly recommend obtaining a lawyer to file a counterclaim alleging uninhabitability.43483.7291666667 Thank you for your time and words of advice. It's very much appreciated and you have given me some very helpful suggestions to follow up with. Thank you again.43484.0319444444 Hello, I am curious to know if a landlord has the right to withhold information to use it to their advantage later on down the road such as: My landlord took me to court for non payment of rent, we came to  a payment agreement and the judgement has been paid off for quite some time now, I have called the courthouse and asked why the judgement hasn't been removed and they said that my landlord hasn't sent in the satisfaction paperwork yet. I then asked my landlord and he refuses to send in the proper paperwork, he has since used the same judgement ###. When I spoke with ### ### about this he stated that they are not suppose to use the same judgement. My question is what are my rights and how can I resolve this matter?? I have lived in the same place for almost ###. Please help me to know if I am in the wrong or how I can get the help I need. Thank you for your time.43480.8277777778 Hi ###! Can I get a little more information from you first? What do you mean when you say â€œheâ€™s used the same judgment against me twiceâ€?If you have the receipt for the payments you made that satisfied the judgment, you may be able to contact the court to provide your own evidence of satisfaction of the judgment. Another suggestion would be to run your credit report. If the debt is still reporting on your credit and doesnâ€™t show that itâ€™s been satisfied, itâ€™s benign misreported. You can dispute the debt on your credit, providing evidence of payment in full. If the creditor doesnâ€™t correct the ###, you should consult an attorney for options in suing for violating certain provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. You have to dispute the debt in order to have a lawsuit though - running your report and disputing the debt is the first step. Without that step, you have no lawsuit.43483.7243055556 Dear ###,Thanks for posting your question.  I'm glad to try to point you in the right direction.  I'm assuming by your question that you don't have a written lease with your roommate?  If you do, the terms of that written lease will govern.  Otherwise, if there is no written lease with your roommate, you are a subtenant.  E.g., your roommate is acting as your landlord and you're leasing from him.  In that instance, you have a month-to-month tenancy that can be terminated upon ###.  If you guys agree to terminate it in less than ###, you can certainly do that, but otherwise, your roommate would have to give you ###.  Also, your roommate could not simply throw you out and put your stuff out on the street as they'd have to go through the usual eviction procedures in Court to get you out.That's not to say that you're roommate is going to follow the law . . . he may still try to lock you out and set your stuff out, but you'd have remedies against him if he did that.  But, I'd suggest not taking that chance.  Secure your personal effects.  If your roommate doesn't want you there, and you're not obligate on any written lease, I'd suggest you get yourself out of that situation and begin looking for something more secure.  No one wants to live under a constant threat of being tossed out in a day.I hope this helps.  If you have any follow-up questions, don't hesitate to reply to this message.  Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck with this matter.###43500.6229166667 Hi ###,  thank you so much for responding to my question,  I did not think it was legal that he do that,  but wanted to make sure!

It takes a lawsuit and service of the summons or posting, and a court date and a judgment for the plaintiff before the landlord may have the sheriff carry out the eviction.

The owner may or may not be liable, but his or her insurance company may have applicable coverage assuming the vehicle operator was a covered (and not excluded) driver on the insurance policy.  I'm assuming you don't know the insurance company, or you would be negotiating your claim with that company already.So without knowing anything else, I would suggest you sue both the driver and the owner.  If you haven't already done so, get a complete copy of the police report.  The incident number is worthless without the report.I'm also assuming you haven't already made a claim with your homeowner's insurance.

A civil judgment cannot be expunged like certain types of criminal convictions can be expunged.  A default judgment was entered against you (copy attached) for $###.  The judgment has been earning 9% annual statutory interest.The attorney who represented the plaintiff was ### ###.  I was not aware he was retired, and his contact information listed with the bar is the same as on the judgment. You could also try contacting ### ###, at the same address.  He would know how to contact Mr. ### and may be of help in connecting you with someone to accept payment of the judgment.  If you cannot reach ### ### to tender payment of what you owe, the next contact would be the actual owner of the property.  St. ### Investors Alliance LLC does not show up as an actual limited liability company in the Secretary of State's records.  I'm guessing this was a ### error.The pleadings show St ### Investors Alliance, LLC as AGENT for the owner.

With this you could file a motion to declare the judgment satisfied, set the motion for hearing and notice up ### ### and the registered agent ### Incorporating Service Co. for the hearing date.    I would suggest sorting this out and selecting options would be best done by hiring an attorney.  You could also probably settle out the debt for less than the full amount.However please remember that paying off the judgment will not remove it from the court's records or your credit history.  But a judgment fully paid late is probably better than an unpaid judgment on your credit report.Best wishes.P.S.  What was the name of the lessor on your lease?43495.8666666667 I will leave this open for another ###.  Thank you.43498.5861111111 Ms. ###,Apparently you're under a bit of a misunderstanding.  Vehicle lemon laws apply only to the purchase of NEW cars.  It sounds like this is a used vehicle, and you are not buying the car.You indicate you are only leasing (not buying) this car.  This does not sound correct, but perhaps it is.  Used cars are generally not leased.You appear to have already substantially breached your lease contract by failing to make payments, regardless of the reasons, and should get the lease payments brought current immediately while you sort out repair responsibilities.  It would be highly unusual in a lease agreement for you to be permitted to unilaterally transfer the lease to another person without the lessor's written authorization.  You cannot just pass the vehicle and the lease payments on to another person.Bringing the payments on the lease current should result in a restoration of the lease status.  You should make sure that you are including any late fees or charges from your contract breach in your payment.  This should avoid the seizure of the vehicle and threatened lawsuit.  This is the answer to what should I do?"Once you have brought the lease back out of default status you can deal with responsibility for repairs.  You should get a detailed estimate from a local authorized dealership diagnosing the problem(s) and needed repairs.  If the lessor is liable for the repairs under the terms of your lease agreement you then will need to discuss how to handle repairing the car with the lessor.  If you are responsible for the particular repairs then you need to pay to fix the car if you want to restore it to proper running condition.  Either way you need to make sure to keep your lease payments current and on time.Can you please attach a scan of your lease agreement for clarification?  I can then respond further after reviewing the lease terms.  Thank you."43496.9965277778 So i got a car from ### leasing it this car had nothing but problems from ### ### i stopped making payments on it until they fixed it they said they fixed all of the problems with it that it was all good to go.

Two of my immediate neighbors received the same non renewal notice with the same ### lease violation complaints submitted by the same tenant.  She stalked and monitored any and all activities, taking staged pictures with no verifiable dates or times.  At one point she became so aggressive, the police were called and arrived shortly thereafter.  After an extensive conversation with myself and two neighbors, they questioned the tenant that had been displaying disturbing behaviors.  She told the officer that she had been doing these things at the request of management.  We feel that the management here are targeting the three of us in retailiation and are conspiring with some tenants to devise a way to force us to move.  We filed complaints with the Missouri Attorney Generalâ€™s office and that investigation is currently ongoing.  We are very worried and not sure what will happen and if we will have any recourse.43559.7576388889 There is a right to renew and a holdover clause in my lease, does mean anything?43563.8618055556 This is a tough situation. It probably boils down to the language of the lease. Why does the lease say about the rules of tenancy? Did you break those rules? What does the lease say the landlords recourse is for breaking those rules? Were all of the Notice requirements under the lease met? If the lease language is not on your side in answering these questions, it is possible you could have a case for housing discrimination, but youâ€™ll have to have a lot of investigation, discovery, and many many more provable facts on your side in order to determine even if you have a claim, let alone how successful the claim would be. Itâ€™s not that you donâ€™t have a claim, just that the claim may be hard to prove. I would encourage you to reach out to a real estate litigator to see if they might be willing to take on your case.43560.6354166667 I had an oral lease with my ### was an old friend, of renting his house for 400.### 100.###.

Without knowing what the petition in the contract action says, it would be impossible to know whether you have any liability but, in order to get yourself out of the action, you would need to have an attorney file a motion to dismiss the claim against you.  That attorney would probably charge by the hour and no one at this point could tell you how long that might take to interview you, do research, prepare and file the motion and argue it or at what rate that lawyer might charge.

But I never got such a letter  They tend to put things on the door and I have had these things blow away in the past and a neighbour bring them to me.

Once i finally got my car back in Sept I started working a part time job and while making a delivery my car just died.

I have called Auto world in Hazelwood where my car has been sitting since October of ###.  The dealership did lend me a car without a charge but I am paying on this ###. I need to know if there is anything I can do or what I can do to get this resolved.  I can't afford to buy another car and pay taxes again.  If there is anyone that I can talk to to help me figure this out I will be so grateful. I am at a loss right now.43504.4604166667 I am sorry that you are having these types of problems.  What I can tell you is that the Lemon Law only applies to new car purchases, not used car purchases, so you will not find any relief there.  From your post it is not clear to me if you currently have a valid title.  Missouri law requires that the title be provided to you at the time of the sale or the sale is void.  So if you still do not have a valid title you would be within your rights to return the vehicle and get your money back (less some amount to reflect the reasonable value for the use that you did get out of the vehicle).  It is not clear to me why the vehicle has been sitting somewhere since ######.43504.7569444444 I did not say that there was nothing that you could do. I merely stated that the lemon law doesnâ€™t apply. You can certainly file a small claims suit. I would contact them to find out what they are doing with the vehicle. 43506.76875 I have contacted and dont get a response.  It's been a little while since I called because I have been trying to find out what I can do. Anytime I do call I get transferred to a voicemail and no return call.  This is exhausting. 43516.025 It took ###..  I do have that... I'm not sure what they are doing with my car... it's just sitting...  so there is nothing I can do?   That is a shame... people don't have money to go thru things like this and nothing can be done to help fix things. 43504.8423611111 Ok... I will get that going. The other thing is they haven't even checked on their car that they let me use. I'm just figuring out that their dealer tag is expired. 43516.7159722222 You may have little choice but to file suit against the dealer if it will not respond to inquiries about the status of your vehicle.  I would try to get them to respond one last time using something in writing in order to be able to demonstrate to the court that you have made numerous efforts and the dealer won't even respond to you.  A judge will have no patience for that type of conduct.43516.6993055556 I understand ### ### sold the debt, but I used its name since the successor owner was not stated.43513.4472222222 Mr. ###,Unfortunately evaluation of the history with Bank of America is beyond the scope of this ### forum.  If you had been identified as a member of a class involved in a class action, you would likely have been notified or notices were published for possible claimants.  You also apparently have a reverse mortgage which has become due. Even if there was a class action still pending that you were eligible to join, which is highly unlikely, it would not be the answer to your present situation.  The internet is a source for class actions, if any.To be blunt, you are very likely grasping at ###.  Most bankruptcy attorneys are familiar with mortgage issues, HARP programs, etc.   If you are not able to do what is necessary financially to avoid foreclosure, I would suggest you investigate whether a Chapter ###.  Your situation is not the normal mortgage situation where there are delinquent payments which need to be caught up over time in a Chapter ###.I suggest you see a local attorney familiar with these issues, and see what (if any) options are available to you.

I'm not even sure from what you wrote if you are the owner of the property, since your parents have died.  Perhaps you were on the deed or received ownership through a probate estate or trust distribution.  Regardless, you need to resolve the debt to ### ### quickly in order to avoid foreclosure on the reverse mortgage. You need to hire an attorney to review your situation and possible options.  I doubt you have any viable claims against Bank of America at this late date, but you can certainly inquire.

My parents didn't have the $ at the time to find out what they could do but after reading all the Foreclosures and lawsuits against BOA - i believe my parents and myself are one of the many family's that were taken advantage of when these loan modifications were through a government program HARP, and money was paid to BOA to take care of all these Loan Modifications but instead lied about losing paperwork and payments!  i have all the documents and names of people that were talked to at BOA and payments made to BOA that are still do back as they were never put towards the loan.  Now we are in foreclosed since both my parents have passed, and with the reverse mortgage to loan is due.  So i am trying to see what if anything i can do to either sign with the class action against BOA on the modification, and if anything save our home from once again being foreclosed on.  we have a deadline of ###th ###, we had to put our house up for sale to stop the 1st foreclosure proceedings to prove we were doing something to save our home.  so just looking for some advise and information that i can get on the Bank of American class action Lawsuit - there are many areas in the us that have law firms and since our home is in Mo looking for someone to help guide our way - I would be very grateful for any help in this matter!  thank you for your time and consideration in this matter!Sincerely, Jamie ReedTo many papers to attach - but have documentation on all correspondence. 43504.7763888889 ###,Thanks for posting your question.  I'm glad to try to help out.  You usually do not need to have a survey done to convey property to one party or the other in a divorce.  If the land is being split up into different parcels, you may need a survey in that circumstance.  It may not be a conflict per se to have the other party's father do the survey, but if you were my client, I'd never agree to it.  I'd want someone independent.  I think if it were up to the judge, he/she would order someone independent to do the survey.  I'd simply not agree to that survey and demand that you want someone independent.I hope that helps.

Can he legally do the survey isn't that a conflict of interest????43507.2486111111 I am sorry to hear about your tough situation but your troubles with your ex husband doesnâ€™t entitle you to terminate your obligations as a joint tenant under the lease.  It is not your landlordâ€™s fault that you signed a lease with the ex and now donâ€™t live together.  I wish I a better answer for you.  43508.1173611111 I have been trying for about ###. We had decided a while ago that we would be getting a divorce but would live in the home until the lease is up but he has serious mood swings and one night there was some serious domestic abuse that made me feel extremely scared and unsafe and then he proceeded to tell me that I was going to regret ever not being okay with him sexually abusing me and threatened me and told me I better not come home. So, thankfully, I had very good friends from work who got me out of there that night and it was only supposed to be temporary until I could get a new place, however, I have to live in ### MO due to a custody agreement with my first sons father saying that in order to hold primary custody of my son, I have to remain in ### school district. ### is already a very hard place to find affordable rentals but because I am on a lease with my ex husband still and my landlord has to be contacted for prior rental history, it has become impossible to find anything. I have applied to ### (everything that has become available and have been denied on all of them because of the reference my current landlord gives me.  He is telling places when he is called by them that I am trying to break the lease with him and because of that, they shouldn't rent to me, so they don't. At this point, I am without my children, every single paycheck goes to a weekly hotel and I don't know what I can possibly do, if anything, to get out of this lease. my ex has told him in writing that he kicked me out (even though he had no authority to) and that he would be staying in the home and paying the monthly rent, which he has been doing and he can afford with no issues without me. Unlike me, where the rent there takes up more than ###/###. My landlord got angry when I told him I was not going to stay with my husband because he is abusive and told me why would I do anything for you when I'm getting nothing in return." Even though nobody is technically defaulting on the lease because its being paid on time every month and my ex has continuously expressed his desire to remove my name from the lease because I no longer live there. And I did notify my landlord immediately after all of this occurred so he knew everything as soon as it happened. Had I had an opportunity to give him ### I would have. But my ex snapped and I was suddenly in a very dangerous situation."43507.9298611111 Does the property fall back to the trust that was done during the marriage or goes to probate if the  petitioner passes away????????43512.2597222222 Ms. ###,It is difficult to guess at the facts involved in your brief post.   I'm going to assume you are speaking about real (not personal) property.Very generally speaking if the property was actually  transferred to the trust by deed (i.e. title is held by the trust), the terms of the trust control.  Some trusts involve distribution of the trust estate to the deceased's estate.  This would depend on the particular terms of the trust.There are many types of trusts, and an ### variety in terms.To get definitive legal advice about the trust involved, you should sit down with an attorney and go over the terms.  This forum is not going to be able to provide a substitute for accurate specific legal advice after a review all of the documents involved and a consultation with a lawyer.The references to during the marriage" and "petitioner" seems to indicate a dissolution of marriage proceeding may be involved too.I may be able to respond further if you can provide greater specific detail to clarify the situation.  I will leave this post open for ###.Thank you."43512.68125 Home would of been in my name had title co performed their duties per my fathers request (his check & my signature) .So, if I didn't own the trailer , why did I pay taxes on it from  ###? I'm thinking that title company is trying to cover their butt. They wouldn't take my case to sue realty company coz they said they have to much business with them.  But yet in the meantime they took another $###    .Then when this shows up on Casenet & I call & tell them I will not be giving them any more money for anything , their only reply was you want the title back don't you?". The way I understand it I believe is the title company is trying to get DMV to waive the penalties but I guess I will never know ### now they won't let me talk to "MY" attorney that they have sent in ###..   Last I knew they were scheduled for court ### & now it is not on the docket. I called & asked where my original title was . Put on hold they asked the lawyer came back & said all she has is a photocopy & has never seen the original & court was postponed. Till ??????????     Thanks! This has been a real nightmare!!"43515.6784722222 I can appreciate your frustration.  You refer to a manufactured home on the property but are you talking about what historically was referred to as a mobile home or trailer?  The reason I ask is that unlike a house which is considered part of the real estate, a mobile home is considered personal property and therefore dealt with differently.Can you sue these folks?  Absolutely as all that is needed to file suit is pay the filing fee.  I assume what you really want to know is whether or not you have a viable lawsuit.  The answer to that is I do not have near enough information with which to make such an assessment.  You will need to meet with a local attorney to discuss the matter more fully in order to get a proper answer.What I can tell you is that if the home wasn't in your name then it too isn't surprising that the sale fell through.  The process of getting the home into your name many years after your father's death is a far more complicated matter than it would have been had it been dealt with originally.  A beneficiary deed for the personal property should have been prepared along with whatever was prepared ### to your father's death.  Then the only thing that would need to be done is an affidavit of death to show that you now own the property.  The title company and the real estate agent likely cannot be held accountable for the fact that the property was not properly dealt with in connection with your father's passing.As stated, you should arrange to meet with a local attorney to find out what your options are.  Best of luck to you.43514.7145833333 I understood that to begin with.  The fact that the attorney owns the title company is irrelevant to the title company's liability as it is a different legal entity.  While you might possibly have a legal malpractice claim against the lawyer it is doubtful that you have any claim against the title company for any of this.  I do not know what connection there is between you having a case with the DMV and this matter unless it has to do with you failing to pay personal property taxes on the mobile home.  Of course if that were the case then it would have had to have been in your name which you said it wasn't.43515.6354166667 My father passed & left me home & ### 2012. We had an attorney come to hospital for paperwork so it would not go to probate. I wrote a check for this.

Sure enough, it has my name versus DMV. I am being   represented by one of his lawyers, whom I knew nothing ab out. But I'm sure I will have to pay for that also. Where do I file & what  do I file. I honestly do not have  the funding. ###!.43515.0298611111 You are mistaken as to the process so it has led you to arrive at incorrect conclusions.  When your father had an attorney complete paperwork to get the property in your name that would not have involved a title company as all that needed to be done was the filing of a beneficiary deed or a quit claim deed.  Neither one provides any type or warranty as to the validity of the title so there would be no title company involvement.  Unless you expressly made the attorney aware that the property had a mobile home on it the lawyer likely just assumed it was a house which would have gotten transfered when the title was transfered.  Whether the lawyer's failure to ensure that it was a mobile home versus a house amounts to malpractice is questionable.  Regardless, there would have been no need for title insurance transferring the property to you via a quit claim or beneficiary deed and hence no title company involvement at all.  You need to understand that just because the lawyer owns the title company does not change the fact that the actions of one are not attributable to the other from a legal standpoint.You mention that you have been paying taxes since ###?  Real estate taxes are assessed against the real estate which presumably you own (and therefore owe) but if there are taxes assessed against the personal property (the mobile home) that would be separate.  If you are saying that you have been receiving (and paying) tax bills in your own name on both the real property and personal property separately for each year since ###.  And to be clear, I do not know if personal property tax is assessed against a mobile home as personal property.  I merely tossed that out being the only possible connection between a suit against you and the transaction you reference.  Is it possible that the underlying issue that caused the sale to get canceled was a lien against the mobile home for unpaid personal property tax?  Just ### that out as a possibility. Sorry that you are having to go through all of this but no doubt it will eventually get resolved.  Not saying this is your fault but want to take the opportunity to emphasize how important it is to make sure that you give all of the pertinent information to your lawyer at the outset to ensure that nothing gets overlooked or misinterpreted.  We lawyers don't always think in the same terms as lay persons so there can be gaps between what the client thinks is the case and what the lawyer believes is going on.  I once had a potential client come to me in regard to an insurance carrier suing him over a fire claim that was deemed to be ###.  He had been represented for over a year by an attorney but wasn't comfortable with how things were going.  We talked for the better part of an hour when finally he commented that he was worried about going to jail if he lost the case.  There was no way that he could go to jail from losing a civil lawsuit but this guy didn't understand that and for over a year he had been freaking out because he made assumptions that were not valid and his attorney never uncovered his client's concerns.  Mind you, I'm not saying you are that guy just that it is important that everyone be on the same page.  So I encourage you to arrange a time to speak with the attorney and get all of your questions answered.  If you are not satisfied with the answers press him on the matter and if still not satisfied then you need a different attorney.Best of luck to you.43515.725 I have never heard of such a thing before.  If you can show that you actually own the property so that you have an insurable interest in it then I don't see why there would be an issue.  I suppose it is possible that the insurance carrier may want to charge more if it ### that the failure of the prior owner to have coverage increases its risk but I do not see any reason why that would preclude an insurance company from being willing to insure the property.  I would suggest that you try speaking with some other carriers or try contacting an insurance broker.  You mentioned that you have a mortgage on the property and the mortgage almost certainly mandates that you carry homeowner's insurance so you need to get this address promptly.43518.7520833333 I have spoken to ###. The first insurance company we were at the signing and the underwriters asked that question about the lapse and rejected the policy, the next said they couldn't do it and the last didn't call back even when I asked for direction on how to resolve. I spoke to a lawyer who said that I either need to sell house or get a lawyer ( he is not a lawyer who is in the field of housing. he referred me to your organization. Thank you for your assistance.43524.6930555556 I purchased a house, in Missouri, ### of 2018. When I attempted to get insurance on the house I was told that I couldn't because there was a lapse in insurance. I was told by the insurance agent, where I was trying to get insurance on the house, that the purchaser of the house must show proof that he had insurance after his purchase of the house. I have made many attempts but he refuses to cooperate and give proof. I have continued to pay the mortgage. I have called and sent letters to get the proof of insurance but he does not respond. I'm told it is contractors insurance that he needed to have after his purchase on courthouse steps.    I need to know how to get insurance on the house. 43518.7451388889 I'm at a loss so it appears that this is beyond me so I am going to return your question to the queue so that someone with the appropriate background can help you.Best of luck to you.43524.7881944444 Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 43528.7375 The volunteer attorney advised me that they would be passing my question back to the queue so that someone with the appropriate background can help me.

Although it is difficult to read what you have written due to the lack of ###, you seem to be saying you were current in your rent when the petition was served on ###th.I'm not sure what parking your car or the water issue has to do with the situation, but if you have paid everything due to the landlord this would be a defense to the lawsuit.  If your landlord has threatened you or your children, this may be a police matter.I would strongly recommend you retain an attorney, both to assist you in presenting your evidence of payment (cancelled checks, receipts, etc.), and for any possible counterclaims you might have against the landlord, if any.Your upcoming court date is on ###, so you have very little time to hire a lawyer.  If you aren't able retain a lawyer by the court date, you can appear and request a continuance.  This may or may not granted. Since a continuance may not be granted, you need to be prepared to present your case on ###th.  You should review your rental agreement/lease in detail to make sure you are in full compliance, and be prepared to present your documentary evidence proving you are current in your rent obligations including any late fees or other charges.  You should be prepared to slowly and clearly demonstrate the terms of the rental agreement/lease, the amounts which have become due and the proof of your full payment in compliance with the terms of the lease.I am also attaching a ### law pamphlet for general information.  It isn't possible for an attorney on this forum to broadly discuss tenant's rights" in the abstract and there is no specific civil law question in your post. Thank you.P.S.

You should also have the proof of ownership (titles, bills of sale, receipts for purchases, etc.) assembled in an organized fashion.If you have already tried this or if the local police department will not provide assistance, you should immediately see an attorney for advice and representation.  Again, you will need a detailed list of the specific property involved and evidence of ownership for the attorney.  There are many different types of legal actions which can be filed, and your attorney can discuss these with you after a full review of the facts involved.  These may include an injunction and replevin action.

Thanks again for the help. 43528.9291666667 I found the attached form online, so now I might understand what you are seeking from your landlord.  It's a Missouri form, however, and you mentioned the IRS.43528.6777777778 I suggest you pay an attorney to contact your landlord and request the document you need. Unfortunately, you donâ€™t have a legally enforceable right to make the landlord provide you this document.  I searched the Missouri Secretary of Stateâ€™s website and learned that your LLC landlord is no longer in good standing. https://bsd.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/BusinessEntityDetail.aspx?page=beSearch&ID=252944343528.1458333333 It was my pleasure.  Iâ€™m closing out the question now. 43529.6909722222 Perhaps your landlord doesn't want to sign the form because the business entity is not registered or has its own tax issues.  I think you'll need to either convince the landlord on your own to be cooperative or hire an attorney to contact the landlord.  I appreciate that money is tight for you and it won't make financial sense to pay an attorney a couple of hundred bucks an hour to write a letter or call your landlord.   Stay persistent with your landlord and be a thorn in its side.43529.6423611111 Thank you for your response. The name of the company is ### apartments llc.

We are all going to stay persistent and I also filed a complaint with the state as requested by my tax preparer so maybe tyhat will wake him up too. I appreciate you taking the time to help me out. Thanks again from all of us.43529.6826388889 You are welcome.  I am not familiar with the tax issue and given that the landlord is the one who generally pays real property tax, I donâ€™t understand why you would be entitled to a property tax credit.  That being said, you are not the first tenant Iâ€™ve heard complain of a similar situation. Did you pay the real property taxes directly?  Did the lease separate rent from property taxes?  If so, perhaps those things make a difference.My answer to your post was based on the general proposition that a landlord is only obligated to comply with the lease.  For example, a landlord is not required to provide a reference.  If you believe there is a statute or regulation requiring your landlordâ€™s cooperation with your tax needs, please cite it and I would be happy to read it and give you my opinion.  43528.6701388889 Due to low income, ### medical costs, and an unemployed member of the household, my wife and I are delinquent on real estate taxes.

You are apparently the owner of the property and required to correct the situation to the satisfaction of the local health authorities.You may still have recourse against the home inspection company or inspector you hired to do the inspection of the property pursuant to your sale contract.  You might also possibly have recourse against the seller.  An attorney on this site cannot speculate about these, nor is review of the contracts and documents involved possible in this ### forum.  There also could be a claim against your real estate agent.The obvious first step you need to take is to schedule a consultation with a local attorney.  Assemble all of the documents and records both from the sale contract and closing, as well as inspections you had done which did not disclose the issue, all documents relating to the health department, as well as any other information such as your contemporaneous notes and records of meetings, calls, etc.  If you have obtained bids on the necessary work, bring them too.The Missouri Bar has a lawyer search function on its web site, which may be useful to you:  ###With a deadline of only a few weeks away, you need o see an attorney as soon as possible this week.  The attorney can evaluate if you have any possible recourse against the inspector you hired or the seller.  However even if you do, this will not prevent action from the health authorities.  The attorney can also represent you in dealing with the health department.Please do not delay in seeking counsel.  Best wishes.43536.5486111111 ### is the relevant statute. 43526.5930555556 ###.

That can take a few weeks. 43526.7520833333 ###:  If you signed an obligation to pay on that note, then you are responsible.  Remember that the bank was not a party to your divorce.  Depending on what your divorce decree says, you may have some recourse against your Ex but this does not effect the right of the bank to pursue you on your agreement to pay them.  I hope this answers your question although it may not help much.43528.8465277778 While I was married to my ex-husband I co-signed on a auto loan for him during our marriage. During the separation and divorce he had procession of the vehicle and failed to maintain the payments with the bank. The truck was repossessed shortly before our divorce proceedings started. However, in our divorce decree the debt of this vehicle was not awarded to any party. When the truck was repossessed by the bank, it was sold. And there is a balance owed to the bank. My ex-husband is refusing to pay any of the owed amount and now I am worry about my responsibility. What are my rights as a co-signer? 43528.8375 For ###.

Also, is it legal for PO to not give me my mail?!?  Two weeks they say nothing, now one excuse is that only a mgmt ### can send a global email out to inform - but they haven't.

On ### my landlord had sheriffs come to my home claiming that I was trespassing in a vacant property. No police report due to no arrest because I proved otherwise. The next day (###) he had my utilities shut off by claiming he no longer owns the property. The utility company told me that is why my utilities were disconnected but will not give me anything in writing because it is a legal matter. I don't understand that. ### he filed for eviction.

I have been living and sleeping in below freezing temperatures for over a month with stage ### ###'t afford to lose due to my VERY  limited food options. The utility company is not required (or allowed, according to them) to reconnect the service without the owner's approval... It is an illegal action but treated as a civil matter, rather than a criminal matter, so the police won't get involved. .. What is the purpose of having a statute in place if it is not enforced by anyone? Not even when violating the statute endangers someone's life?? 43537.0979166667 I hear you, but despite your belief that what your landlord has done is criminal, unless he violated a criminal statute it is a civil matter.  You could file a motion and seek a preliminary injunction seeking to have the utilities turned on.  If you've been occupying the premises and not paying rent due to no fault of the landlord then I fear you won't get much sympathy from the judge.43537.5368055556 Tough situation.  Whether you may file a counterclaim depends on the type of claim filed against you.  No counterclaims are permitted in unlawful detainer cases.  Contact Legal Services of Eastern Missouri to see if you could get representation to defend the lawsuit.  Unfortunately, you have little time.  Even if Legal Services provides counsel to defend the case, it wonâ€™t file a counterclaim.  Best wishes. 43536.0520833333 I also have more pics43536.6041666667 I moved in this place ### now ###.

I expect to represent myself if the suit goes to court. My ###'s name is ### ###. He currently resides in ###, Fl. I live in the house that we purchased in ### City, MO.  His name is on the deed as co-owner. His name is NOT on any of the mortgage documents. Assuming I'm served papers, what is the ### to counter suing?  I honestly don't want anything from my ###, but for him to drop his lawsuit, and to sign a ### to the property. In the unlikely event that I lose the suit, will there simply be a lien placed on the house?Should ### die before me, can he pass his interest in the house as a part of his estate? Or, because I'm the co-owner of the home, does that interest fall directly back to me?43544.74375 It is not possible to answer your questions without access to some key documents.  For example, whether or not his death results in his ownership interest passing to you or to his heirs depends upon the way in which the deed reflects the ownership interest.  If it states that the property was granted to you and he as joint tenants" or "joint tenants with right of survivorship" then whichever one of you ### the other will take full ownership of the property.  However if it states that the property was granted to you and he as "tenants in common" then when either of you dies their interest in the property will go to the decedent's relatives or whomever is identified in the decedent's will.There is no cause of action that can be asserted to make you pay him for half of the property directly but he could file an action for partition.  A partition action asks the court to split the property up so each owner can get their share.  While that can make sense for a large tract of land like a farm it doesn't work very well for a residence.  As a consequence what happens is the court sells the property and splits up whatever is received from the sale between the parties.  If that is what this person sues for then there will not simply be a lien on your property but rather it will be sold out from under you so this really isn't something that you can ignore if he does in fact pursue it. In the partition action you can file claims in equity to show that you are the one that has been paying all of the taxes etc.  If a mortgage was taken out to purchase the property and the mortgage is only in your name then you can further show that he has not contributed to paying for the property either.Bottom line this is not something that you can afford to simply handle on your own or you will likely end up losing your house.  I strongly urge you to contact a real estate attorney to discuss the matter and all of your options."43544.8083333333 Thank you very much for answering my questions. I will seek out a real estate lawyer and see what can be done. 43544.8777777778 I signed a lease about ###. The rental property doesnâ€™t have a occupancy permit and it had failed an inspection. The landlord wants me to turn on the utilities in my name and I told him that I wonâ€™t be doing that until the permit is obtained. I told him I will pay the utilities, I just wasnâ€™t going to transfer them. They donâ€™t respect my privacy and think they can come when itâ€™s best for them and not me. Although I moved into the home without the permit, I didnâ€™t know about all the work that needed to be done. They keep saying how they thought they were doing me a favor because I moved in, but in reality, they actually made the situation worst. Iâ€™m paying the utilities and the rent. I just want to know what can happen because I donâ€™t have the permit to even be there and if the lease that I signed is even valid. If not, should I seek an attorney before things go too far?43544.8326388889 Yes, you should consult with an attorney to review the lease and provide you informed legal advice.  On one hand, there is no occupancy permit.  On the other hand, you were aware of the lack of a permit and youâ€™ve been occupying the premises.
