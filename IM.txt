I have been denied for disability I have appealed and gotten denied again what should I do next ? 43638.8791666667  I received a letter from DSS that a report had been sent in for possible fraud. I  know who did the report. My parents have been going through a ### divorce since January and since January I have already had CPS involved in my life, my mother overdosed herself in front of my ###, that case was closed within a few weeks, they saw no reason for an investigation. Now my mothers parents are furious I have stood by my father. They had made threats  to call DSS! They stated I was not reporting my sons father helping me pay some ### when I needed it. Told DSS that he lived with me, and my parents raised my older child. None of which is true. I have always been close to him he's always been close to my daughter as well. We've dated on and off, he stays some night at my home to be around the kids however he does not live here. He stays at my dads house mostly, he needs help with ### after my mom moving. He was staying with friends some as well. His license has my address and his mail comes to my house. It has been that way for years since he didnt have a stable home. I know all of this points to the accusations being right but they arent. I would never guess that his mail coming here and ID would make this his residence.  I have been honest when ### that he helps when I need it. I met with the investigator a week ago, she asked questions all of which I answered as well as I could. I told her there are times he will stay the night just to be with the kids and I will stay at my dad's, I told her he stays with my dad alot now, I told her that sometimes we are all together. Now I communicated with legal aid whom has now told me they cannot help me at this point. But I dont understand what to do next. I am a single mom, and what legal aid sent me says that if the investigator chooses to say I'm guilty there could be jail time. It seems crazy that they would do that when this is all bogus and simply petty family drama. If she decides to see that his ID is here will she assume he lives here and go ahead and send it to court? I feel like I have no voice in this. They are going to see what they want to see and not the facts. Again I am a single mom. I have no intentionally dont anything wrong. All I can see is that I shouldn't have allowed him to have his mail sent here. Please help.43663.8590277778 I am at a loss what to do next. I called the investigator a couple days ago and asked if there was anything she needed from me and she said not at this point. She said this could go on for ###. And if my grandparents chose to they could just keep sending report which is exactly what they will do. These are cruel people. They sexually abused all ###, they were physically aggressive to my brother, my grandfather has been in and out of jail. Most recently for ### my aunts husband. This is all out of pure ###. I am the only person that raises my kids and I struggle as is.

I submitted my claim with them and was never specifically told that I need to send medical proof" of injury for my claim. I was only asked if I planned to see a doctor to which I answered yes.

I never heard back and was forced to leave my job as I was not being paid and needed to find better employment. The managers at my work were sent a copy of my claim and my doctors "proof" after also claiming that I was on an unapproved leave. Am I able to get the money I am owed?

At this stage, I think you have more of an administrative and practical issue to work out, rather than a legal one, but that might change if ### cannot sufficiently explain what is going on.  If necessary, either you or your employer would need to retain an employment law attorney or employee benefits attorney to engage with ### more eagerly.I hope that you can soon work this out, assuming you have not already since you first posted this in early August.

What can I do about it?43696.6770833333 Thank you for your inquiry.  If your payments were deducted from your paycheck through your job, the first thing you should do is contact your HR department or your benefits manager at work to make sure the premiums have been paid to the insurance company.  If they have been properly submitted by your employer, then perhaps someone in your HR department can help you deal with the insurance company.  If your employer has not been submitting the premiums to the insurance company, then you might have a claim against your employer for failing to make the payments.If talking to your HR department does not resolve the issue, you may need to hire an attorney.  I suggest you contact the NCBA Lawyer Referral Service at ### or 1-800-###.Best of luck.43735.7180555556 I was injured in NC while working. my clavicle is fractured and my ribs were fractured and I wasn't able to get any kind of treatment since time of an injury. my injury did not get any better and I am still unable to use my arm properly.

I really appreciate it. Is there a lot of cases like mine? is it really difficult to get an award from our employer? If it is possible, what kind of lawyer am I supposed to look for?

Try ### & ### at ###-###.  43704.8027777778 Your attorney can have the compensation award entered by the Industrial Commission against the employer, like a judgement.  If the employer does not have insurance, then the employer would have to pay out of pocket.  Your lawyer may be able to get the NC Attorney General's office involved to help force the employer to pay the award.  43704.7048611111 According to the North Carolina Department of Labor, PTO needs to be paid upon termination UNLESS there is a written policy that states that PTO will be forfeited. In reviewing your case, there is a written policy in place that states PTO will be forfeited upon termination. Unfortunately, you are not legally entitled to those wages. 43763.7708333333 I was terminated from my job last week and they are refusing to pay out 50+ hours of PTO, their employee handbook states that Employees are not paid wages in lieu of unused PTO time upon termination from the company except where state law prohibits."  from my understanding PTO is considered a wage in NC and that by not paying out they are not paying me for over ### would I be legally entitled to those wages?"43762.7444444444 How can I go about obtaining my ###' replacement ssn# card as her stepmother?

Generally to get a replacement social security card for a child you will need to go to your local Social Security  office and present info that establishes that the child is a ### citizen ( birth certificate) and that the child for whom the birth certificate  was created exists: day care records / state issued ### school i.d. etc.However, the agency will also require you to prove your legal relationship to this child. Are you the adoptive parent or a legal guardian? If so, you will need to provide documentation of this also.43763.7506944444 Hi ###,I cannot tell you what your chances are for overturning this decision on appeal. However, I would say that on appeal, you should consider making the following points:Even if you were terminated because of a background check, the decision was incorrect.  You were determined to be disqualified under NC ### Stat Â§ ### which contemplates an employee terminated due to their misconduct on the job.  The statute lists examples such as showing up to work intoxicated or directing physical violence towards you co-workers. Failing a background check because of arrests or convictions that occurred prior to your employment does not fit under this statute's definition of misconduct.  I attached a copy of the statute so you could read through it and make your argument based on what you read.But, your background check was not the real reason for your termination.  An individual from the human resources department told you that the real reason for your termination was that the employer was laying off a number of temp workers.  You should provide as much detail from that interaction as you can including the name of the person and the date of the conversation.Be honest and be consistent.Best of luck.43817.6951388889 I recently got denied my unemployment benefits. They said the reasoning is because I was fired due to my legal background. So I want to appeal the case. I was never fired I was laid off. I was working through a temp service. I went thru the hiring process ###. They allowed me to work and eventually they would give me more offers. Each time I was denied getting hired on because of my background. After the last offer a month or ###. My supervisor told me they couldnâ€™t hire me. Come to find out they were letting go of all temps and they would no longer have temps. My denial paper says I was discharged due to my background. But in reality I was laid off because they were letting all temps go. I have video of the HR lady telling me they have to let temps go or else I would still be working there. I need some advice please. What should I state in the appeal? Do I have a good chance to overturn their decision? 43815.7736111111 Dear Sir, your question is not possible to answer ### by email.

Thank you for providing the denial letter. Without knowing all the facts, it seems that you still have a valid case and should continue through with a hearing (which you have a statutory right to). At this point, I highly recommend you seek out an attorney. As you likely know, workers compensation attorneys work on a contingency fee basis. So they require no money upfront and are paid out of the settlement they achieve for you (which is often much higher than you could get on your own). You will likely face a wall of insurance attorneys otherwise. I am happy to provide competent referrals if you call our office number below.

I do not understand where you are in the process.   It sounds like DOL accepted some of your injuries for worker's comp but not others due to a lack of nexus.  This is a common reason for refusal and attorneys who do this regularly know how to write a response for the doctor's signature.  It requires very specific language and making sure other language is not in the letter.  If you are someplace else in the process I can't figure out what your issue is. Please check out the NCBA lawyer referral service to find a relevant attorney or check out the internet for Federal worker's comp attorney.  Make sure its Federal Worker's comp and not state as these are very different programs.  Finally, all Federal Worker's Comp attorneys require payment up front for their time and effort.

They can speak to your landlord, relatives, pull your taxes as you said, and much more. Whether the under reporting happened because of an error on your part or DSS, you will be responsible for the back payment due to more recent food stamp laws. You are required to report any sort of income you are making in exchange for the benefits.If your deadline for your hearing has not yet happened, you can call Legal Aid of NC at ###. You will have to keep calling because they serve the entire state and sometimes they are very busy. If your hearing is in the next ten days, I'd advise you to call the ### Legal Aid office directly at ###-### and leave a voicemail stating that you have a case with a hearing in ten days and you would like some help in investigating your case. They may not be able to represent you, but it is worth a shot!I wish you the best of luck!43881.6847222222 I am asking for assistance due to Medicaid and food stamps benefits. I know I did not report back to them. But I was self-employed and not earning a whole lot. I also have a child due to the situation I was in with state social workers. I could not be able to report back the earnings I was making. They did not make me aware of the amount owes to a month. They are claiming they got my info from my taxes. But I just question how they came about the amount I owe to them.43857.7173611111 Thank you!! I will do this. As I already been doing this!! I have been declined for a fair hearing for Medicaid already.43881.8395833333 Hi Mr. Soley, I am sorry for the unfavorable decision you received. I have reviewed your ALJ decision. I will say from experience, in my former office, very few cases were appealed after this ALJ stage. After the Administrative Law hearing, the case gets appealed to the Appeals Council. At the Appeals Council stage, there is less than a ###0% chance of the case being overturned or being heard again. I say ###0%, but it is actually much lower given that you have to have substantial medical evidence to back up your claim.That being said, I did review your ALJ decision. While you have a lengthy history of medical evidence, which is always helpful in a case, your most recent medical evidence indicates that your mental health conditions are stable. It appears your sleep apnea is under control as well.Unfortunately, given your age, you are relatively young and the Social Security Administration will always use youth against a person applying for Social Security benefits. While the chances of winning on appeal at the Appeals Council level is incredibly slim, if you intend on moving forward, you should look at page ###. There, you should try to attack what the Administrative Law judge said about the statements in Exhibits 6F and 8F not being made by licensed professionals if you believe they are. In the second paragraph on page 9, the Administrative Law judge states that there is some evidence that is not consistent with your medical records. These records are exhibits ### ###. I would look at those to see why the judge believes they are not consistent and explain why the Judge committed an error of law." When you are appealing a decision to the Appeals Council you must use language that does not personally attack the judge. While I believe your chances of succeeding at the Appeals Council level is slimmer than the ###0% chance I cited above you never know if your case will be overturned and whether the same judge will hear your case.I understand that you would like other resources to turn to. I believe your former attorney is either from Legal Aid of NC or the ### Center for Legal Advocacy. I doubt the other firm would take your case on if the other has declined to appeal your case at this level. I would look at your former attorney's advice as well moving forward.I wish you the best of luck!"43881.6631944444 My lawyer dropped me after the notice of unfavorable opinion arrived.

As I explained before, you will need to contact Legal Aid of NC for help and advice. Any income you have made can and will be used in your calculation of benefits. Any financial assistance you receive, whether a hobby or a job, will be used in your calculation of benefits. Any assistance you receive from family members if they help to pay your bills, like your rent, will be used in your calculation of benefits. You will likely need to make a payment plan with them.You can call Legal Aid of NC at ###. You will have to keep calling because they serve the entire state and sometimes they are very busy.

Thank you for your understanding and I wish you the best of luck!43882.6979166667 I have had asked my county for information on this. I need some legal advice on how to go about this as I would do the paperwork to prove that the self-employment job was a hobby, not an actual job. Due to the taxes being a ###. So they are trying to count the amount against. They have declined my fair hearing on Medicaid already. I am also want to get one with food stamps. I give them my taxes for ###. They have my fees for 2018. Be aware I am a single parent. I want to get this resolved as it has created a lot of problems. As my contracted job had ended in ### of ###. Can they count that income against me? As it was not a significant amount. I will be willing to discuss this matter with someone if they are willing to help me with this as they are holding me up for what I believe is an excuse. I want to get this resolved as I was not making a lot either for my daughter and me. They have been playing on my benefits from ### ###. I would get off the system. But they are refusing to help the matter, And also getting information about getting this and that. I would do anything as they do not seem to want to go to court on it. I need resources as I do not have a lot of families to assist me with the matter. I am on my own.43881.8381944444 Let me tell you a little more about what and why this all happened. All had started back in ###. They promised me they would help me along the pathway of getting this place. But they did not, which is why i remain in the system. While I was on the system, I have seen my food stamps were always changing to a point I was only getting ### (Social Services of ### County) had told me that I can keep my address the same as I had not found an actual place for me and my child who is now of ###. They left me with her abusive father. Who I did not want to stay in their life. As I do not like to move due to not having many options, I do not have a lot of families who I can get along. I did get a place of my own by Nov of 2018. I did not mention work to them as I was only less than what I could afford for food between a mother and a child. They told me straight up I could only get an increase if I had a place of my own. They knew i was getting child support but not the extra cash. I felt that with being self-employed on taxes. I was not getting like employment as i was a contractor who paid a lot of my taxes to the county.But recently, when i go into their office, i felt like someone was picking on me due to my lifestyle and chapter, which is wrong to do when you're dealing with human services. I only know this because I was going to go to school to be a social worker myself. But I was never gotten into the classes. But I did get the studies. I felt they were treating me wrong over the years too. Remember, I did not receive help with moving and the cost of that to do. I almost had to do it on my own. I have never felt like a threat to society until they had added this new caseworker. Who just recently said something about watching my Facebook, but from my point of view, she is not my investigator who was to determine anything to do with my case but only could tell me if i was able to receive or not. I have a document about i did lose my job due to a complaint. This social worker i feel has me targeted, but I do not understand in all why. So my case involves more than legal aid will handle. My job said they fired me due to a third party complaint, which is why i lost it. Once i missed it, the county came to me. So there is a lot more than just because i did not tell them that income.43887.6743055556 When I say find me a place to live they inform me to move out of my parent's house as it was not liveable for a child. If i knew my options while i was pregnant this all would not happen as it did. I did not receive help by a social worker who promises me but i got less done.43887.6756944444 WHERE CAN I FIND A PRO BONO ATTORNEY THAT CAN HELP ME WITH  MY APPEAL  FROM THE JUDGES ### DECISION?

Thank you for your time and response.  44111.0895833333 If you weren't a spouse during his active service you don't earn any of his possible benefits.  You got married after he was out.  Being the spouse of a veteran, unless he is a fully retired veteran gets nothing, and if fully retired, basically just the pension and medical (Tricare).From the information you provided, there are no benefits for you at this point.  If he was 100% VA disability rating and you were married when he passed away you could possible get the 100% property tax exemption, but it looks like you were divorced before that.Sorry, but his ### get you any benefits.###44111.8111111111 When did your ex-husband start his military service?  When did he separate, get discharged, or retire?  What does your divorce decree say?Military benefits are for the service member and their family.  Once you are divorced, you are not part of the service members family.  Any benefits you might get like a portion of retirement pay should have been figure out in your divorce.Most likely, since you are not married or married when he passed away if that is the case, most likely, there won't be any benefits.  Please provide the information requested above and a copy of your divorce agreement.###44111.0979166667 I went out of work several months ago broken wrist the workers comp told me i am getting payed from my company i am considered self employed but the pay me and take out deductions,workers comp says the cannot pay me because i am getting payed from my company but i have too hire several people too do my work arent they entitled too pay me since i end up with no income44151.7034722222 You need to contact a workers comp attorney in your area and let them review your case.###44151.7368055556 My question has to do with a defined benefit pension plan under ERISA. My employer Defined benefit plan was frozen ###. it provides a monthly pension benefit for life at normal retirment date NRD (age 65/00). I am presently with the same employer and nearing normal retirement date. Can I apply for and receive my monthly pension benefit at normal retirement age (age 65/00) and continue to work for the same employer? Since the plan is frozen, I am hearing from other employees that I must terminate my employment with my employer in order to receive and start my monthly pension, that seems incorrect since my monthly pension is frozen (it will NOT grow anymore) and I am nearing my normal retirement age as defined under the plan, I should be able to start my monthly pension and continue my employment with the same employer. My original employer has merged with successor organizations over the years but I am effectively with the same employer. it is my understanding that under ERISA law, once I reach NRD under the plan, I should be able to start my monthly pension without delay.

PLEASE HELP ME.44314.7875 You need to find a local labor attorney that handles unemployment claims.  Based on your facts provided it seems like you just decided to take off and collect unemployment without a valid legal reason.  See the attached chart as a guide.  It doesn't cover all scenarios, but does cover most.###https://www.nj.gov/labor/assets/PDFs/COVID-19%20SCENARIOS.pdf44314.7965277778 ### - I'm sorry to hear your claim was denied, but I do think a lawyer could win the case.The good news is that you can hire the best lawyer in town who specializes in SSI disability claims for zero money in advance. The Social Security Administration regulates attorney's fees to protect you, and will allow your lawyer to be hired on a contingent fee basis - meaning that he does not get paid anything at all unless your SSI benefits are approved.  You then are entitled to a regular monthly SSI check - and the lawyer has no fee in that. But you are also entitled, if he and you win the case, to get benefits for the months or years in the past they were not paying you. That is called the retroactive award" and often amounts to $20###.  The lawyer would be paid 25% of the retroactive award by Social Security directly IF THE CLAIM IS APPROVED and you would get 75% of the Retroactive Award paid directly to you.Thus you can hire the best lawyer (the fee is the same for all lawyers representing you) with no money or cost up front and unless you win the lawyer works for free.So go online for lawyers in your community who specialize in Social Security/SSI disability claims and call him or her for an office consultation.Lawyers do know how to win claims that would be denied if you don't have a lawyer.  Many times I recommend that people represent themselves BUT NOT in Social Security claims. Dealing with the complex rules and the medical evidence really should be done for you by a lawyer and fortunately you don't have to try to find a free lawyer or legal aid - the best lawyers in town will represent you on the contingent fee basis.Good luck and I wish you the best!"44111.9402777778 Can you help me in the search?

Eventually, all of your father's assets will go to his children. If you have siblings you will split it evenly otherwise everything goes to you.  As for the car, the court will have to give it to you and it will have to be titled in your name, then you would have to title it over to your father's girlfriend.

It is for asking specific civil law questions, but is not a site for obtaining a lawyer.  It's unlikely you're going to receive a response within ###, after which your inquiry will be deleted without a response.  In addition most Missouri lawyers are not familiar with Illinois laws.I can only suggest the man contact a private attorney, local legal aid office and perhaps Illinois legal aid.   Based on what you indicated, it may be necessary for him to file suit and prove his identity to get a court order requiring the Illinois BVR to issue a copy of his birth certificate.

This is because the SSI program is for people who are both disabled and indigent. Therefore the SSI rules ask lots of questions about what you own. You should have been asked about this asset early on and it was a mistake if you were not.i suggest you request a waiver of repayment of your previous benefits- especially if you cannot afford to pay them back anyway.  The SSA does issue waivers in some circumstances. Also, you should try to find a lawyer that specializes in Social Security law to give you a brief free consultation as there may be a way to show the apartment out of this country is not a countable asset or that it is below the asset limit allowed.To address your second question, SSI benefits usually require one to report their household's income.  Therefore, if you and your spouse live together, her assets will affect your benefits and, likewise, your assets will affect her benefits.I hope this information is helpful.  43507.2409722222 Me and my wife were allowed SSI from ###16. In the recent interview for redetermination the officer asked us if we own any property outside US. We replied that we have an apartment in ### in which we were living prior to coming to the US. It is registered in my wife's name and it is still there and not on rent. We were never asked this question about property outside of the US in the previous two interviews. We were never aware of this clause nor was it ever mentioned to us prior to this interviewThe officer told us that in that case we are not entitled to SSI and the amount paid to us in the last two years (Which amounts to approximately $###) should be refunded by us. It was also suggested to us that we dispose off the property to be entitled to SSI again. The officer also told us that the SSI will remain suspended for ###. We are not in a position to refund such a big amount nor is it possible to go to ### and sell the property and bring the money here because of exchange restrictions and time constraints.A secondary question that we have is that if the property is under my wife's name, why is my SSI also affected? We seek advice on how to proceed with the matter.43495.1013888889 I forgot to mention that you would be well-advised to address what appears to be an outstanding warrant for your arrest (attached).I am also attaching a sample of an appellate brief for your reference (attached).Best wishes.43503.7819444444 I need assistance interpreting the language in a court order regarding my unemployment appeal brief that was sent from Missouri court of appeals Eastern District43503.7138888889 Mr. ###,Appellate practice requires knowledge, training and skill that many average attorneys do not have, and few pro se litigants possess.  I will try to ###" the court's order for you but it isn't going to be much help.  This forum is for specific civil law questions.   You need a competent appellate attorney.Your brief fails to comply with the Civil Rules of Procedure in multiple ways.  I'll try to take the items in the court's order one at a time.###.  You used an improper font size and/or type in your brief.###.  You did not include a proper jurisdictional statement in your brief factually demonstrating the basis of the Court of Appeals' constitutional jurisdiction over this appeal.###.  You did not include a proper statement of facts with citations to the pages in the record on appeal.###.  Your brief did not contain concise and specific points relied on the legal basis for the specific alleged errors with supporting legal citations.  Your brief must state the specific errors you claim were made by the Commission and cite legal authority for the specific claimed errors.5.  You did not include an argument section which conforms directly to the points relied on citations to legal authority and reference to the standard of review.6.  You did not include an appendix.No disrespect intended but what you submitted simply does not even vaguely resemble a proper appellate brief.  I would not expect you to be familiar with the applicable civil rules or the art of brief writing.   Appellate practice is highly technical and requires detailed legal knowledge.  Broad general allegations and conclusory statements do not make a brief.  More than a few licensed attorneys have had their briefs ### due to their failure to comply with the rules. The function of an appeal is to demonstrate exactly the legal errors made and not to reargue the issues which were or could have been presented at your hearing.While I've tried to give you a little additional explanation regarding the specific deficiencies mentioned by the court's order I'm afraid this will not be of any assistance.  It is likely that even if you resubmit the brief pro se it will still be severely deficient and your appeal will be dismissed.  Self-representation is often difficult frustrating and highly unsuccessful.  Sometimes people need to hire a professional -  whether it be a plumber a surgeon an electrician an auto ### a lawyer.My only advice would be to immediately hire an attorney who may still be able to obtain another extension to file your brief.  However since you missed the hearing and therefore presented no evidence this may be a pointless exercise and a waste of thousands of dollars.  At least a consultation with an appellate attorney may enlighten you on the less than likely prospects of succeeding with the appeal process.LINKS:  RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO ALL APPELLATE COURTS https://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=677CIVIL RULE 8###:  Procedure in Appellate Courts  https://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=99###RULE 8###.0### - Briefs8###.0###.

Payee for a mentally impaired cousin.  I resigned in ### of ###.  I took necessary paperwork to the local office at that time, along with the money left in that account.  September of same year, I was in the office concerning a different matter, when ### ### called my name, and asked me to see her before I left.  Allegations of misuse had been made against me by the cousin, and she needed a copy of the Annual Report that I had done on-line for ###-###.  I made a copy of that report, and took the confirmation number I had been given when filed, and she told me that would be all she needed to clear it up.  In ### or July of ### ######, except a few items I chose to keep.  (They were kept for the two years required, and I had not heard anything, and had no need to keep them)  In September of ###016, I received a letter saying I had been overpaid $###.### ###.  Having no receipts, I went to the files still available to get another copy of the Annual Report, and from memory made a list of how the other money could have been spent.  When I took that information to ###, she told me about some of the allegations, and wrote my responses, and told me that I would hear from her.  I heard again in May of ###018, by letter, stating that I had no recourse but to make arrangements for payment. At that time, I asked for a copy of my files, so that I could prepare a defense for appeal, and was told I had no appeal.  (That was not true, I discovered, but I still was denied a copy of my file.)  I asked for an appointment, finally got one, and took the cousin with me.  They refused to listen to either of us, told me they weren't going to pursue criminal charges, but I had no appeals left, and I must make arrangements for ###.  I again asked for a review of my file, and again was denied.  I discovered that I still  had appeals coming, and sent a Waiver Request.  I just had a phone call and follow up letter this week, saying I had to come in on the ###0th of this month for a personal conference, but only to set payment arrangements. I again asked for my files, and again was denied.  I have proof of all of this, and so much more.43510.6826388889 My understanding is that the process is long, involved and almost always ends up being denied to begin with.  There is really no reason not to get an attorney as they generally take a contingent fee percentage based upon the back pay owed when it is finally granted.  Do yourself a favor and hire a SSDI attorney to assist you.  As for your second question I cannot speak to that as I do not handle these but I cannot imagine it being legal to limit your appeal rights based on not having a lawyer.  However, you could well fail to do something necessary to preserve your appeal rights by not having an attorney so the end result would be the same.43517.9576388889 Thank you so very much for the advise and the ### you provided it.### B43518.0861111111 The ssa agent that received my appeal paperwork asked if I had legal representation and then stated he could not advise me one way or the other.###) Would it be in my best interest to have legal representation during this appeal process?###) Would my not having representation prevent me from pursuing any further appeal if it is denied again?### B43517.9277777778 Did your son's father have any other children or are there any other relatives through whom you could get DNA for paternity testing? It is possible that Social Security would accept such results but your son's father would also have needed to have enough eligible credits paid into social security in order for him to receive any benefits.43525.7888888889 My son's father was murdered and I am trying to receive death benefits for him bug he is not on his birth certificate! How can I get the proof I need for social security?43521.65 Since he was murdered is it possible that the ### ### has his specific DNA? As long as you believe that he has paid into SS for enough time to qualify for benefits it is worth your while to check into establishing paternity via a DNA test as depending on the age of your child it could be years in which you would get benefits; especially if your daughter is older. However; I donâ€™t know the exact computations but if both children collect benefits the total amount of benefits will be allocated between the children and then when the oldest turns ###â€™s benefits will be adjusted.43526.2097222222 Yes I also have a daughter with him and she receives the benefits! He has a sister that is willing to take a dna test but social security seems to believe that that is not enough evidence because they said that i could have had a child with any man in his family! Crazy huh lol but getting his name added to the birth certificate would hold up better43525.8284722222 My wife and I were getting SSI since 2016. In the recent redetermination interview at SSA, we were asked if we have any property outside USA. We replied that we have an apartment outside the US where we were living before migrating to the US and it is worth more than $###. We were then told that we are not eligible to receive SSI and may have to refund the amount received so far. We were further advised to dispose off the property before ###. My questions is Can it be sold to one of our sons who lives outside the US orCan we sell it to our daughter in law who also lives outside of the US Will SSA have any objection to this sale? 43527.1701388889 I hate to be the bearer of bad news but you have no chance of prevailing as you will never get past your failure to appear for the phone hearing. While you likely did see a case that ruled for the claimant that missed the hearing because he/she was expecting to be called the court did not rule in the ### favor for that reason. The court noted that the Division of Employment Security failed to follow its own regulations which werenâ€™t updated when it changed to a conference call system. The old regs still indicated that the Appeals Tribunal was to call the parties. It was that failure on the Divisionâ€™s part that led to the person getting another hearing. As you can imagine the Division promptly updated the regulations after that and that is no longer a   winnable basis to get another hearing. In fact there are several newer cases which explicitly state that the ### failure to follow the clear instructions provided does not constitute good cause for failing to appear for the hearing. Additionally, you are not going to be able to show good cause to extend the time for filing your appeal since you have no explanation aside from assuming it would be changed later on down the line. Each of the determinations or decisions expressly state the time frame for filing an appeal. Your failure to read that portion of the documents and follow those instructions is never going to be good cause under the law. Lastly, the Missouri Court of Appeals is not like the appeals youâ€™ve done up to now as it will require that you fully comply with all of its appellate rules and will not let you slide because you arenâ€™t a lawyer. Almost every claimant that appeals to the appellate court ends up getting its appeal dismissed for failure to comply with the rules. The Division tries to be lay person friendly - the Court of Appeals does not. Like I said, Iâ€™m sorry to have to give you bad news but from what you have indicated you do not have any chance of this going your way. I would focus my ### on finding another job rather than waste time on this as itâ€™s a lost cause. 43528.30625 I started receiving unemployment benefits after being terminated from ### on ###. I missed my ### 9/### ###. The deputy determined I was unavailable for ### due to non reporting. The letters I received stated my eligibility would change after I reported to the career center. I reported on ### but my eligibility status never changed. I appealed the deputy's decision but then I missed my telephone hearing because I thought they were going to call me like they did the last time I received benefits and had a hearing back in 2011. I then waited way too long to file my appeal to the commission because I just kept thinking that my eligibility status would update to eligible since I had reported. I thought it was just taking a little while, like when you first apply for benefits. After a few weeks went by I realized it wasn't going to change so I went ahead and filed my appeal to the commission but it was past the ###. I then immediately filed an appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals, which was filed timely and has been accepted. Now I'm facing this court appeal and have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. I know I have to file my brief, which has to be filed by ###th. I've been researching cases online trying to find some that support my case but all of the ones I've seen for filing late to the commission all seem to be dismissed. I can't seem to find anything giving me a reason to believe that I can get them to actually review my case, but I also can't find any cases online that are similar to my case in anyway whatsoever. I have seen them for missed telephone hearings, and even saw one, which I can't find it again to quote it, that allowed the missed phone hearing due to expecting a call because that's how it was done the previous time the claimant received benefits. I haven't seen anything regarding filing late to the commission that was overturned nor have I seen anything about being found unavailable for work due to failure to report to the career center. I did notice on my appeal papers for my initial telephone hearing for being found unavailable for ### that on two different ones it showed that the deputy did not request a statement from me about why I missed my appointment, just that I didn't report and that without further information I was ineligible. I really feel like if I would have just made it to my telephone hearing correctly that this whole thing would have been overturned way back then. I feel like the only thing holding me back now is the extremely strict ###. 43528.1256944444 Does my daughter have rights to SS from her deceased Father. He has not worked very much in the past few years due to Addiction. He has been in and out of jail and treatment centers leaving him without a steady work history. The Father did pass from and overdose. Does that affect the outcome of the qualifications. 43558.8138888889 Ms. ###,An attorney on this forum cannot determine whether or not your daughter is eligible for social security survivor's benefits.  This depends on the number of work credits earned and age of the father.  The reason for his death does not matter. (From the Social Security web site)A worker can earn up to four credits each year. In ###, for example, your spouse can earn one credit for each $### income. When your spouse has earned $###, they have earned their four credits for the year.The number of credits needed to provide benefits for survivors depends on the worker's age when they die. No one needs more than ### (###) to be eligible for any Social Security benefit. But, the younger a person is, the fewer credits they must have for family members to receive survivors benefits.Benefits can be paid to the worker's children and the surviving spouse who is caring for the children even if the worker doesn't have the required number of credits. They can get benefits if the worker has credit for one and one-half years of work (###) in the three years just before their death. Each personâ€™s situation is different and you need to talk to a Social Security claims representative about your choices.If you need to report a death or apply for benefits, call 1-800-### (TTY 1-800-###). You can speak to a Social Security representative between ###.m. and ###.m. Monday through Friday. You can also visit your local Social Security office. An appointment is not required, but if you call ahead and schedule one, it may reduce the time you spend waiting to speak to someone.                                                                                                      ###The only way to determine eligibility is for you to apply for benefits.  Thank you.,43568.04375 I am Autistic and have never held a job I don't understand when people say things because I take everyone seriously and I don't have a filter and my mom is afraid I will get into trouble because she said I don't have a filter I don't know what That means.

Thatâ€™s why the judge wonâ€™t allow them in the room  Ask your parents to hire an attorney who practices Social Security disability law   Because of the financial consequences to you, you cannot afford NOT to hire an attorney.  43575.1520833333 I spent â€œmy careerâ€ employed in the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS), paying into my retirement plan and Social Security. I applied for disability from my employer and for SSDI. I receive both. Recently I read an article in the AARP Bulletin about receiving benefits as a â€œpublic service employeeâ€ and SSI simultaneously. Is a FERS employee a public service employee? Is there a concerning issue here?43578.5291666667 Not that it's important, but your question was posted on ###rd, so I'm confused as to your calculation of ###.  As far as finding an attorney, this site is not a lawyer referral service or for finding an attorney to hire.The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function, which might be helpful:  ###But starting with a visit to a local social security office would seem to be the logical first step.  best wishes.43604.6770833333 Sir,I'm sure there might be attorneys who could answer this question for you easily, but probably none of the ###.  Frankly this is not a question I can answer without a great deal of research, and even then I might only be able to give you my best guess.  I am responding rather than just letting this question expire after ###.My first thought is that as long as you have fully disclosed to both that you are receiving disability and SSDI, you should be safe from any criminal prosecution if it turns out you were receiving benefits improperly.  You should be able to document that you notified each of them of the other" benefits as a precaution.  But just putting them on notice might not prevent collection of improperly paid benefits.You can go down to any local social security office to meet with someone and explain the situation and to make sure that you are not doing anything wrong.  Bring documents with you.  If the person indicates you're in the clear make sure to get the person's name - and if possible a letter or statement ### your conversation.  [Bring some reading with you as it can be very slow sometimes at the social security offices].You can also do the same with the benefits office from FERS.  You've then covered your bases.  That's the best you can do.  It's possible you'll find out that some adjustment has already been made in your social security payments based on the FERS payment.  My wife's ### security teacher's pension wipes out most of the social security benefits she would receive from ### work due to the Windfall Elimination Provision.

I have criminal records in Missouri and a FBI file that verifies my identity, but Social Security is denying me my old age benefits unless I can prove who I am and they say I need a birth certificate. I have spent seven months and tried to find a record of my birth in ### and ###, and I'm not even sure in which of those two states I was born.  I have no living relatives of which I am aware, I never had a drivers license, and I never went to school.  So, I cannot request a delayed birth certificate.  Now I cannot get medical care, food stamps, medicare, or social security benefits.  Is there some way to get a court order for the state of Missouri to issue me a state identification card since they had me in prison and know who I am?  So far, they have not helped me.

I was wondering how I could find an attorney in ### County that accepts legal aid and represents Social Security clients.43581.8763888889 It seems you have misunderstood this forum.  The site is for asking specific questions about civil law, but it is not for obtaining a lawyer or an attorney referral service.The Missouri Bar has a lawyer search function, which may be of use to you in seeking an attorney.  The link is:  ###Best wishes.43581.8986111111 I am filing a motion to recall a mandate ###. I am filing a motion to recall a mandate ED###. Unemployment says I have an overpayment of $###. I worked at Express Scripts from ### ###. Unemployment made the decision to entitle me to unemployment benefits. I got unemployment benefits on a weekly basis like normal. Two months later in ###. By that time, I found another job at ### Jewish Hospital, collected most of the unemployment benefits and stopped filling. I filled an appeal to Express ### appeal and a hearing was scheduled. I missed the hearing due to my son being severely ill. I filed an appeal to missing the hearing and got another hearing rescheduled. I kept missing my hearing dates with unemployment the The Labor and Industrial Commission sent my case to the Missouri Court of Appeal and I didnâ€™t know how to represent myself so my case got dismissed. Unemployment is sending billing statements for me to pay ### pay or even if I make payments they still will confiscate my state and federal taxes what do I do please help. Do you think the Missouri Court of Appeals judge will recall my case it got dismissed.43628.8465277778 If you missed your appeals hearing you must show good cause for your failure to appear. Your son being severely ill might possibly qualify as good cause but not necessarily.  If you missed subsequent hearings it is exceedingly doubtful that you would be able to show good cause for failing to appear multiple times.  These hearings aren't just at your convenience - they are legal proceedings and you must appear or there are legal consequences.I take it that you appealed to the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission and were denied relief.  Just so you know, the Commission does not do hearings so if you thought that the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission would give you a hearing you were mistaken.  If it felt it was appropriate it would send it back to the Appeals Tribunal for an evidentiary hearing and then either have the Appeals Tribunal issue a decision or review the record and issue its own decision based upon the evidence presented before the Tribunal.  The fact that the Commission didn't send it back to the Appeals Tribunal suggests that it found no legitimate evidence of good cause for your failure to appear.The Labor and Industrial Relations Commission does not send cases to the Missouri Court of Appeals on its own but it likely considered your continued appeals or requests for a hearing to be a Notice of Appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals.  In other words, you in effect requested that the matter be sent to the Missouri Court of Appeals.  At the appellate court ### are held to the same standard as licensed attorneys so you got no breaks due to your lack of understanding the procedural rules.  Almost all of the unemployment appeals by unrepresented claimants that make it to the Missouri Court of Appeals end up getting dismissed for that very same reason.  It looks like your case was dismissed almost seven (7) months ago so there is nothing that you can do at this point.I do not know what was going on in your life that kept you from appearing for your scheduled appeals hearings multiple times but you cannot simply miss a hearing.  I'm sorry that you are struggling with this but there simply isn't any legal recourse at this point.43628.8645833333 He would have needed to file a claim with the bankruptcy court.  It may now be too late as there would have been a claims deadline on the paperwork he received.  He should consult with a bankruptcy attorney to determine if it is too late to file a claim.

Both Social Security and V. A.  will approve a responsible relative to be a payee for a person's check, especially if the recipient requests it because he/she is having difficulty managing their finances. You should visit the Social Security office and the Veterans Administration with your daughter(s) to discuss a payee. If you trust your daughter(s), their names can be put on your bank accounts, insurance policies and car titles. A trust would only be useful if you have any other concerns you have not mentioned. You should fill out a healthcare directive If you have not already done so. The forms are available at the Circuit Clerk's office or Probate office at the County courthouse. If your Medicare and VA benefits are not covering your medical expenses you should see if you are eligible for Medicaid at ### Services office.43678.8902777778 Thank you for your help.I do not have a lot of money and do not own anything, not house, car, investments or anything.

The law is quite clear that if you quit a job during the base period (basically the last ###) that you are not entitled to receive unemployment benefits UNLESS:Quit for Good Cause Attributable to the Work or Employer:  This basically means that you were treated so badly that anyone in the same or similar circumstances would have quit so it is not an easy thing to show;Quit Due to Healthcare Related Issue:  This really requires you to show that your medical provider advised you to quit your job or that you were out on a LOA which exhausted all of your FMLA or other available leave and weren't yet released to return to work; orQuit to Accept a More Remunerative Position:  Although More Remunerative" technically means better pay the Division ### this ### very broadly and will consider better benefits or a much closer commute etc. in de###ining whether it is more remunerative.  There is one key requirement that you actually earned wages with the new employer.  You said that the new employer ended up firing you so I'm guessing that it isn't a problem of you quitting for another position that never ### as that would be a problem.  That portion of the statute is to deny benefits to folks that just claim to have quit for another position when there really wasn't another position.Based upon the facts which you have provided I do not think you will have any difficulty establishing that the job was more remunerative in light of the fact that it was presumed to be continuing work unless your former employer appears and disputes your claim that your position was ending in a few days.  You mentioned that you were working through a contractor.  By that do you mean you were working for a temporary placement service?  If so and you failed to contact the temporary service before contacting the Division of Employment Security then you may be denied on that basis as there are special provisions for temp agencies.Just focus on showing that you were doing your best to procure employment due to the impending conclusion of your current assignment based upon your understanding that there would not be any ### work for you there within a week's time and you should be fine.Good luck."43726.7590277778 I really don't know what to do.

I am not in that area but I will try to provide you some guidance. The formula is as follows:Weeks of Disability (from Body Chart) x Percentage of Disability x ###/### (or state maximum whichever is less) = $###_____Please see ### for additional helpful information as well. The body chart is located at ###.  Carpal Tunnel Claims are valued at the ###.  If you had ### tunnel it is rated at the elbow at the ###. Your rate is normally calculated looking at the ###.  If you are paid a salary or differently than hourly, however there are multiple ways to calculate this.  Taking your gross wages they divide by ### TERM00065###.  That is your wage rate.  If ###/### ###. So, here is an example:A claimant files a carpal tunnel claim using ### as the date of injury.  That worker makes $1,000.###.  His Rate would be $###.  Since the maximum rate for permanent partial disability for that period of time was $###.###.  Say this person had surgery and the case was accepted, this is what the formula would look like:###% x $###.48 = $###If the surgery left a scar on the wrist then they would be entitled to some disfigurement for that as well. Most argument occurs about the percentage of disability.  Their physician normally rates lower than what you would get.  However, without representation it may be difficult to get them to a number that is appropriate.  I am not sure how the judges value these claims in that part of the state.I hope this helps.

Then in late ### ###.  ever since then I have been disputing the overpayment.  I now have a hearing in front of an administrative judge, but I don't know how to go forward with the case as far as how I can request the documentation I need from the SSA documents.  I have not kept all documentations from them since all this has been going on, and I know that there are a lot more documents out there that I need.  Most lawyers won't even talk to me about this or take my case and I need to know how to proceed with this myself, how can I get what I need from the Social ### office.43739.3305555556 Good Afternoon Mr. ###,I am sorry to hear about your issues with the SSA and finding an attorney to assist you.  First, I would like to layout what the process looks like for an over-payment from the SSA.  Back in 2003/2004, you likely had the opportunity to request a reconsideration from the SSA or seek a waiver of the charge.  From the information you provided, it appears you sought to have the amount waived.  There are a three appeals processes that can occur after you have sought a waiver:  a hearing before an administrative law judge, an Appeals Council Review, and finally a case in federal court.  In addition, you can also request to settle the overpayment for a lower amount (###).  Regarding your question of how to obtain the documents you have filed with the SSA, there are two ways to do this.  I would recommend going to your local office to speak with someone in person.  You will need to provide your social security number in the office as well as a photo ID and there will likely be a wait.  You may also call the Social Security Administration's toll-free number 1(800)###.  I would not call unless it is not possible for you to go to the office personally as it can be very difficult to reach a person over the phone.Regardless of which route you choose to take, I would recommend that you have a general idea of what documents you are looking to obtain from the office.  You will want to ask  for all documents they have sent to you since ###.  The list will help to provide more information and direction to make sure the office provides everything you are looking for.  The office will then mail that information to the address you provideIf you are looking for someone to obtain the documents for you, you will need to fill out and file a Consent for Release of Information form (###).I hope this information helps.  I know it can be difficult dealing with the SSA but going to the office in person has worked best in my experience.Please let me know if this answers your question or if you require more information.Good ###43761.9125 Good morning,Which office are you going to?  Do you know what the main office is and is it possible for you to go there?###43775.6798611111 I have tried going to the office but they say that what I am asking for is something I need to do with the main office and that they can't help me. I feel like I keep getting the run around. I can't get any answer when I call. I have no idea where to go from here.43771.0381944444 Hi ###:I am so sorry for your injury and I hope that you have made a good recovery.Because your injury and case took place so long ago, it is possible the case was dismissed.  I think you need to start by hiring a new workers' compensation attorney.  I looked on the web and there are some attorneys in Union, MO that practice workers' compensation.  Make an appointment with one of those folks (there should not be a charge) and ask them if they would be willing to make some calls about your case.  The new attorney will need your SSN or your work comp Injury No.Generally speaking, if your case had already settled and your former attorney was holding your settlement money in his Clients' Trust Account, his estate, or the firm that took over his cases would still have the money or a record of where it was sent.  If your case was not settled and still pending, I am afraid that the Workers' Compensation Division will have dismissed it long ago and you will most likely be out of time to refile.I wish you well in all your future endeavors.43770.6333333333 I was involved in a workers compensation case. And I went into a coma. And my lawyer died. How do I get my money. My lawyer was ### ### law firm in union mo. Against ### ### asphalt works was the company located in pacific. I need help getting my files and getting my compensation. This happened over ###. 43741.8069444444 Until August of ###  was working for the IRS , in ###  using my PTSD and anxiety as a ###. When I contacted EEO, ###, anti harrassment it worsened.I filed a workman's comp case it was denied because I was denied access to the information. And was harassed even worse while I was trying to file the workman's comp information. That happened for over a year.in October of ###'s comp case related to carpal tunnel repetitive use injury. I have since had surgery to move nerves in my elbow and carpal tunnel surgery in my hand this past September. I've been off work since August I'm trying to file for disability retirement. As well as workman's comp for the two injuries stated above.I also have documentation where I contacted the office office special counsel in ### ### regarding the harassment and have been advised that I may want to pursue a p p p case  and a  merit promotional violation based something. I have applied for SSDI and am awaiting an answer from them. In the meantime I'm looking to pursue the workman's comp cases. Is this something I could get assistance with? Or federal disability retirement representation?Or even assistance with PPP / Merit Promotional violations.43777.6263888889 I applied in ###16. Went through the process. Denied twice and appealed. Informed of when my hearing would be with the ALj. ### , the hearing was ###. Case was sent back to field office for review. I was sent additional paperwork to fill out . Completed and returned all requested information.  I was sent for a psychiatric evaluation. Within two weeks after evaluation was completed,  I received  a letter tell me I was denied. 43782.2055555556 Dear Mr. ###,Apparently you may have misunderstood this forum.  It is for asking specific civil law questions, but it is not a site for obtaining a lawyer or a lawyer referral service.The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function here:  ###Best wishes.43818.0791666667 Do you assist in supplemental security income cases?43817.9319444444 Dear Ms. ###,This forum is for asking specific civil law questions, but I cannot find one in what you wrote.  You will find a brochure about worker's compensation law here:  ###You should schedule a conference with an attorney who handles worker's comp claims immediately, to determine whether or not it is too late to file a claim.   You may have already severely damaged your ability to bring a claim.The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function here:  ###Best wishes.43821.1270833333 I fell at my work in October of this year. I went to the doctor but was scared to tell them that I fell at work. Finally I did. They wanted me to push the workmanâ€™s comp thing. My supervisor always said that â€œyou are fired before you hit the floorâ€. But he agreed to pay my medical bills. He still hasnâ€™t paid them. The longer they go without being paid the higher they go. I havenâ€™t been able to work since I fell. 43821.0770833333 I tried to get help with SSDI and discuss my overpayment and refused provided for interpreter ###'t want sssi back want to resolve why owe amount money and still refused set an appointment for interpreter have ### understand application and need help fill out application they refused help me43829.8659722222 I missed a day of work unknowingly. On ### I went into my job to collect my paycheck and explain that the missed day  must have been an oversight on my part and asked to still be employed because the incident was a mistake. The supervisor whom I was speaking with went to discuss the incident with another ( I don't know who).The supervisor returned and told me that they considered me quitting. He the collected my work attire. I had no warnings or disciplinary with this employer. I filed for unemployment and was denied. I filed an appeal. When I received information from the Appeals Dept. I learned that the employer had stated that I had missed ###. The alleged dates missed were ###th ###, and ###-### ###. I was in my opinion let go on ###th when the supervisor took my uniform keys and said I was considered to have quit even when I pleaded to keep my job. Also to my knowledge I had ###### off. I have the hearing scheduled however the employer(owner) is refusing me any documents that I need to make my case. I have asked in person,and through fax. There has been no reply for ###. I also attempted to have the Supervisor who collected my work attire put on paper the date he took the items and why they were taken. I faxed the request for information to him with no reply. I then went in person to Supervisor to obtain the information. He phoned the owner and was told not to provide the information.         If I had known what the Employer(owner) was alleging, I would have had more time to know what I needed to prove my case. It took several weeks to receive hearing information in the mail due to the holidays. I am hoping the hearing officer will subpoena the needed documents and witness within the small time I have. I am at a slight disadvantage since the Owner requested an in-person hearing which is ###. I will have to do a phone hearing so I cannot request video which would prove my case either.       My issue is I was told that I was considered to have quit by the on duty supervisor on ###th when I went to get my paycheck like i did every thursday. I wanted to keep my job, but the Sup. collected my uniform and work key.  How did I ### ### on ###-9th? Anytime I inquire about it I get refused very rudely at that. How can I get information? I dont want the employer to claim im harassing or anything. I am just trying to get what I need before my appeal hearing. I was never given any policies regarding absences or attendence. 43842.1180555556 To begin with you put â€œN/Aâ€ for opposing parties which isnâ€™t accurate.  Your former employer is the opposing party.  It is important to include that information so that an attorney looking at the question can determine if they can respond. If I represent the employer it is a conflict of interest for me to answer your question.If you need documents or witnesses from the employer then you must subpoena them through the appeals referee as soon as possible. You will be required to have the employer properly served with the subpoena. 43842.2104166667 Dear Mr. White:I cannot tell from what you wrote whether or not you previously filed a worker's compensation claim, if you reported the injury to your employer at the time it happened or how long ago your injury occurred.You probably will be able to find answers on the Missouri Department of Labor & Industrial Relations site:  https://labor.mo.gov/dwcHowever to obtain a definitive opinion as to whether or not you still can assert or pursue a worker's compensation claim, you would be well-advised to simply schedule a conference with an attorney who primarily handle's such cases.  You should be able to find an attorney who will not charge you for an initial consultation.The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function here:  ###An attorney in an in-person or phone consultation can explore the history of your injury in depth, and advise you as to what options, if any, which you still may have.Best wishes.43851.84375 Hello, I use to work for a company called Missouri Cooperage.

Thank you."43851.8444444444 Because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, there is no guaranteed protection for use of medial marijuana, even if you are a certified patient under ### medical marijuana amendment. Because ### Medical Marijuana program is so new, and the conflicts between state and federal law have not been addressed by the Courts, there is still a significant amount of ambiguity surrounding these issues. I would expect there to be more clarity on this, and many other issues involving marijuana in the coming years, but at this time there is no clear answer to your question. I would recommend that you contact the attorney who assisted you in getting your disability benefits as they will have more information about your specific case and hopefully be able to give you advice that is tailored to your situation.43883.76875 I have been disabled and receiving disability benefits for seven years. I am in chronic pain with my disability conditions. If I were to grow and/or consume medicinal marijuana, will social security end my benefits being that medicinal marijuana is legal on a state level but not federal? I get ssdi.

I am at the point where I would like to find an MSW position or remote position working very part time to start but unemployment says I am not eligible because I am under Dr's Care." I have printed all the apps and correspondence from jobs I can find. My argument is that I am disabled but I want to TRY to work to see if I can. What evidence do I need to show them that yes I am disabled and yes I can't work FT but I deserve unemployment because I want to start PT and hopefully transition to FT? I do not want to be on disability forever if I get approved. I was told by a woman at the Unemployment office that the rules are not that I have to be able to work ###.

"43903.1444444444 My stance is that UP UNTIL THIS POINT I was unable to work, but now I would like to try to work ###, as it has been a year and a half since my last day of work and I have been seeing doctor after doctor ever since.  So during that time I was incapable of holding a Part time job, but now I want to try. I do have an attorney and he said that it was ok for me to go ahead and apply for unemployment if I felt that I could work part time, as my case and all evidence was closed at this point after the hearing and we were just waiting for a decision.  Apparently none of these government programs talk to each other because I was denied medicaid and disability for not being disabled enough, and I am denied unemployment for being too disabled.43903.6805555556 The position you are taking is fundamentally at odds with getting unemployment benefits. While seeking disability you must assert that you cannot work in order to be entitled to disability benefits. In order to get unemployment benefits you must assert that you are ready, willing and able to work. These assertions are in direct conflict with each other leaving the division with no choice but to conclude that you are not being truthful. I would focus on getting your disability benefits rather than trying to seemingly talk out both sides of your mouth. You need to get an attorney to assist you with your disability benefits if you havenâ€™t already. Disability attorneys typically take a percentage of the lump sum awarded for the backpay from the time of applying to the time of approval. In other words you wonâ€™t have to pay anything out of pocket up front. Without an attorney it is exceedingly difficult to get disability benefits. 43903.6291666667 It doesnâ€™t take that long to get unemployment benefits so it appears that there is an issue with your claim. The initial Deputyâ€™s Determination is normally issued fairly promptly so did you receive that indicating that you were denied? If so, did you file an Appeal within the timeframe listed on the determination? The deadlines for appealing must be met or you will have difficulty getting benefits. I will need much more information in order to give you specific advice beyond suggesting that you follow up with the division to find out what the hold up is. 43903.6354166667 On ###th I was fired from my job of ###3 ###/###.  It's  been ###. Why is it taking so long for me to get my unemployment?  What can be done to move this process along.  I have bills to pay.43903.25625 Hi ###.  Sorry, you are going through this.  Unfortunately, Social Security through SSI does count your spouse's income regardless of your disability.  It is a needs-based program.  You do have the ability to ask Social Security to reduce the amount or waive the amount.  Check out this link for assistance.

Unfortunately, you  will need to appeal the denials as you were already told. If you feel that you cannot handle that yourself then you will need to hire an attorney to do that for you. In fact, it is probably wise to do that anyway to ensure that everything is done correctly. This is not the sort of thing that an attorney can guide you through in this forum. You will likely be able to hire an attorney on a contingency fee basis so you wonâ€™t be out of pocket. I wish you the best of luck getting this resolved. 43944.76875 My husband had a heart attack very suddenly in our home.

MetLife said I filled out the form wrong and appeal it. No I'm grieving help me n they said no. Rude so here I am43944.7125 ###,Tax debt is stressful and seems to last forever.  Hopefully the information below can help.First, the IRS has ten years to collect a tax assessment; that ten-year period begins running on the date of the assessment, or ### of the year taxes were filed if assessed as a result of a tax return.  By your statement regarding the statute of limitations, I take that to mean the Trust Fund Recovery Penalty (TFRP) was assessed in ###10.  Be aware that there are circumstances where this collection period may be extended.  Actions that can extend the ten years can be found here: https://www.irs.gov/irm/part5/irm_05-001-019 (5.1.19.3, examples include being out of the country, bankruptcy, requesting an installment agreement, and requesting innocent spouse relief).  Let me know if you think there may have any situation that has extended the statute of limitations.Second, generally speaking TFRP tax debt is subject to the Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP).  The FPLP allows the IRS to collect 15% of any Social Security Title II benefits (Title II includes old-age insurance benefits" that begin at age 62).  If you apply for Social Security prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations the IRS can send you a Notice of Intent to Levy.  You would have ### (CDP).  One of the issues you can raise in the CDP is that the statute of limitations had expired when the levy was issued; however filing the CDP extends the statute of limitations for the length of time it takes to resolve your request.As of ### new levies have been suspended as a part of the COVID-### but only through ###.  Therefore there would still be a period of four months that a levy could be pursued against you before the statute of limitations runs.The levy stops when the statute of limitations has expired.  You can apply for benefits four months before you want benefits to start.  By filing in July your first payment can be delayed until November and bypass the potential for levy.Therefore while the levy on Social Security benefits will not extend the statute of limitations if you are sure that the statute of limitations expires in October it may be less headache to just wait it out if you are able to financially.  On the other hand levy is only 15% of the payment so if you need the remaining 85% to start in July it may be worth going ahead and filing the Social Security application; there may be some time and headache involved in stopping the levy once the statute of limitations has expired though so be prepared for some delay there.Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any additional questions.Thank you for your service!###"43972.275 I owe an outstanding Trust Fund Recovery Penalty.

Is it possible to open my case again?43959.7541666667 If your case has been taken through the Missouri Supreme Court then you have exhausted your appeals and are done.  No you cannot start over or have a review of the case at this point.43959.8763888889 Good afternoon, ###:Thank you for your posting.  You ask too many questions for the brief exchange that this website is intended for, but I can still at least point you in a productive direction, which I think is just as good since your steps towards legal actions will be slowed by both financial considerations and Covid-###9.  Here's what I suggest you do when both delaying factors abate somewhat, in favor of ### steps:First, I agree with your premise that at some point in the future, estate planning will need to be part of protecting yourself and your disabled son.  This will require a seasoned estate planning lawyer who can help you decide on whether a will or living (revocable) trust is the most appropriate for you based on your asset situation and reasonable life expectancy.Second, as to your son, it is very likely that the best way to address the compelling concerns that you raised is to have an estate planning lawyer (perhaps even the same one you hire for your own, individual needs) to prepare a detailed, comprehensive special needs trust.  This will maximize your son's eligibility for federal benefits based on his disability, while still allowing your son to benefit from distributions from a trust that the federal government approves.  Special needs trusts require deep expertise in the law of trusts and federal benefits, and should NOT be attempted on your own; there is no reliable template you will find on the internet that would not seriously jeopardize your son's eligibility for SSI, disability or other benefits under federal law. Third, given the complexity of your and your son's situation, I seriously doubt that any estate planning lawyer will be willing or financially able to invest the amount of hours necessary to complete a well-crafted plan that is tailored to your needs; this is simply too great an investment of billable time to do for free.  (You might find a few lawyers who will offer free initial consultations of up to one hour, but probably not much more than that.)  Templates and forms online are not adequate to the needs that you described.  You should generally expect a special needs trust to run anywhere from $###,### $TERM00065### (entirely reasonable, in my view), and your own estate plan to run near $###,### (or a little less, depending on what you need).  You can do searches on ### (for free), and search in the greater-Greensboro area under the practice areas of Estate Planning" and "Trusts."  Also keep in mind The Law Office of ### ### located just across the street from Guilford College.  ### and her team are among the best in estate planning in the entire state not just Greensboro.  You can read many excellent brief answers to legal questions about trusts wills powers of attorney and guardianships that ### has posted by looking at her Avvo profile.I suspect you will need a couple months to get all this together but once you have more solidified financial resources investing in a reputable estate planning lawyer is well worth your time and money.  This will protect your son organize your own future estate and give you the peace of mind that you need and deserve.Thank you for your courtesy and well wishes on this site.  God bless you your son and all your loved ones and friends abundantly the present pandemic notwithstanding.Be well."43931.9152777778 Hi Thank you for your kind attention. I hope this finds you well.  I am sorry that I have so many questions I need to ask you. I am a widow, a US citizen with a ###, ###4. My husband was also disabled till he died ###.  I have been receiving SSI as the spouse and also for the beneficiaries : my daughter (her payment will stop when she turns 16?)and my son. These payments are all under my late husband case/social security. What I think I understood so far was that since my son was disabled, he continued to receive it. So the ###. Correct?  My son is doing okay now with the treatment. Thank goodness for the medicaid/medicare he has. I do have the POA for him.  However, I am always worried that he can have bad episodes at any condition. Should I trust the money to go straight to him for his  future and change the case to be on his own as he permanently disabled? Is it more beneficial for him that way so he can start building his credit and be more independent? Is it worth it to try to ease my burden? Does it make much difference? For that purpose then,  do I need to have my son reapply with the SSA office and transfer the case or open for a new case?  I have filed my tax as the head of the household or qualifying widow (not sure) in the past ###-###.  I do not mind the way it is now. But what are the things I must know? What should I do to prepare if I decide to remarry or/and before I die? I know that the benefit payment for me will stop as I remarry but again, what will happen with the benefits for both my kids ? My daughter is a minor. Will the income of my future husband affect the case or/and the amount? Is there a disadvantage for me or/and my daughter, becoming a step daughter,  on receiving federal college tuition or other government grants if I marry someone with higher income? I actually am in school to complete a college degree now. One last thing, for a temporary purpose, until I have money to pay a lawyer, what website should I use that you can recommend to print a will template that is good enough for my situation? I really need to make a will/estate planning soon. Unless you can please give me an agency  or law firm who can help me and do it for free/less fee. Thank you very much for your help. I  appreciate the answers. I look forward to hearing  back from you.

Need Help Thank You.44067.5722222222 Good Afternoon.Hope you are doing well. I am writing you to ask questions that pertain to a Annuity Settlement that I started receiving in ### question is...Is it possible to settle my annuity for lump sum payment? Reason: Unfortunately, medical bills, Covid Employment Issues and s c hefuled medical procedures create burdens that I have no other solutions for.I would love to hear from you in this matter soon.Thank You,Kandi Parks44105.7152777778 Yes, but you will have to get court approval of this lump sum settlement if your Annuity Settlement was the result of litigation in North Carolina.The statutes that govern the conversion of an annuity settlement into a lump sum settlement are found in the Structured Settlement Protection Act (N.C.G.S. 1-543.### 1-543.15). Here is a link to those statutes:https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_1/Article_44B.pdfYou will have to apply to the court or administrative agency where you got the settlement. The court will then require that certain disclosures be made to you about how much you would get if nothing changed versus how much you will be getting in a lump sum and any fees you will incur in the conversion. The court will also have to address whether it is in your best interest to take the lump sum.Here is a helpful article about that process:https://civil.sog.unc.edu/reviewing-structured-settlement-sales-the-courts-role/There should be a good number of companies that will be willing to offer you a lump sum in exchange for your structured settlement. Those companies should probably also shoulder the burden of applying to the court for approval of your lump sum payment.I'm sorry for the additional stress you are having because of bills. Hopefully, you can get a lump sum approved and take care of those bills with it.44110.5534722222  Was suppose to receive ###, ### and a state Medicare/Medicaid package for low income.

Based on your question above, it sounds like you currently receive SSI (Supplemental Security Income) which I note is different than SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance Program).  Generally speaking, in order to be eligible for SSI a person needs to be (a) aged ###, blind or disabled and (b) earn limited income and have limited resources.  If a person has work income it could reduce that person's SSI benefit payment amount and if a person has work income over the allowable SSI limit (which is $###) they may no longer be eligible for SSI benefit payments.  However, it is important to note that not all work income is countable for SSI purposes and there are certain income exclusions under the SSI program that reduce a person's work income for purposes of calculating the amount of their SSI benefit payments.  So an individual can earn more than $783/month from working and still qualify for some SSI payments (and in many instances a person can receive more money from a combination of work income and reduced SSI payments than they would just from SSI payments). Generally speaking, for purposes of calculating a person's SSI benefit payment when they have work income, the first $### (whether related to other government benefit payments or work) is excluded, the first $###, and ###/###.  Here is a link to a page on the SSA website explaining this in more detail as well as a link to another website that likewise explains the same in more detail (both webpages also include example calculations):  https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/ssi-only-employment-supports.htm and https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/income-asset-limits-ssi-disability-eligibility.html#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20the%20income%20limit,(more%20on%20this%20below). Rather than trying to figure out how the above exclusions and calculations will apply to you and potentially impact your SSI benefit payments, the best thing to do is to just call Social Security, explain your situation to them and have them walk you through how and if you taking on a job might impact your eligibility and benefit amounts.  Their phone number is ###.I wish you nothing but the best.Thank you.44151.69375 I'm on SSI disability and I want to know can I get my own place and also can I work for income if I decided to get my own place to support myself.44121.1194444444 I don't have an attorney.

Unfortunately, there are many questions that would need to be answered in order to determine whether this claim should have been denied.  Furthermore, you may have other liability claims that you can file.  You should seek an apt with an attorney in your area that handles both worker's compensation claims and personal injury claims.  This should be a free consultation so do not delay.  I hope this information is helpful.  44139.8013888889 Thank you so much for your time and quick response. I will take that advice and get the ball rolling.44139.8868055556 ###,I hope you are doing well. The best thing to do is to contact the Social Security Administration at 1-800-### and explain your specific situation to them.  They should then be able to advise and assist you with any questions or concerns you might have, specifically what the impact of you potentially receiving your own social security benefits might have on the benefits you currently receive as payee of your son.  This is a very fact specific analysis and you'll need to provide them with all of the relevant information.  For example, what age is your son, is he receiving SSDI benefits on your record or SSI benefits on his own record, if he is over the age of ###/income and what is his income.  Additionally, for example, are you trying to apply for SSDI benefits or SSI benefits, do you have a job/income and what is your income, and what (if any) other government benefits do you receive.  Without knowing the specific facts of your situation it is difficult to give a clear answer, and in any event, the Social Security Administration should be in the best position to look at the specific facts you provide them and let you know how they impact your specific situation. Without knowing the specific facts of your situation, I would guess that your son is receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments and that you are currently acting as his representative payee.  If you being receiving your own SSI or Social Security Disability Insurance Program (SSDI) benefits, I do not believe that this would impact your ability to continue to act as representative payee for your son's SSI payments.  However, depending on the specific facts of your situation, your sons SSI payments could be (although they might not be) reduced, and you might need to ensure that your son's SSI payments go into a separate bank account than any payments you receive.  Again, this is a very fact specific inquiry and something that the Social Security Administration should be able to assist you with analyzing if you call them and provide them the specific facts applicable to your situation.   I wish you nothing but the best.Thank you.44158.7305555556 I live in North Carolina..

If so, yes, you can get government assistance, however with unemployment benefits, you are certifying you are willing and able to return to work. Are you wanting to return to work for income? You could, but you would need to keep in mind how many hours you are working and how much you are getting paid. If you start making a substantial amount of money, that could make you ineligible for benefits.

SSA will generally contact you within a year of turning age ###. SSA calls this review the age-###. During this medical review SSA will send you a letter to ask for the following information about your disability: â€¢ Names of any medicines. â€¢ Hospital stays and surgeries. â€¢ Visits to doctors and clinics. â€¢ Work activity. â€¢ Counseling and therapy. â€¢ Schools and special classes or tutoring. â€¢ Teachers and counselors who have knowledge of your condition.Doctors and other trained staff will decide if you meet the disability rules for adults. SSA's disability rules for adults are different from SSA's disability rules for children. Historically about one-third of children lose their SSI eligibility following the age-###. When SSA decides if you will continue to qualify for SSI SSA will write to let you know our decision and will explain your right to appeal the decision.In this case because SSA already determined that your child is disabled and your child is receiving benefits it may be best to wait for SSA to send you the notice and let SSA evaluate whether you child can continue to receive his benefits.Best of luck."44281.7444444444 Good morning, Based on your description, it appears you have an accepted workers' comp claim and now your employer had denied benefits.  If you were released with restrictions, your employer should have accommodated but failed to do so.  Assuming you were not terminated for cause, your employer should have accommodated your restrictions even if your original ### was eliminated. Based on your description, it appears that you are no longer working for the employer.  If that's the case, your best course at this time is to hire an attorney to handle the next steps. An attorney will likely (among other things) file a Form 33, Request for Hearing, with the NC Industrial Commission.  This will tell the Commission that there is a dispute in your claim and will initiate the mandatory mediation process - meaning the parties are required to participate in mediation regarding the claim to see if it can be settled.   If the case doesn't settle, the claim will go to a hearing before the Industrial Commission. During a hearing, a judge will hear both side of the arguments, the parties will have a certain amount of time to submit their legal arguments in writing (called ###" in workers' comp) and the judge will ultimately make a decision after he/she has reviewed the ###. If you are still actually employed by the employer there are other things to keep in mind if you move forward with a Form 33. Should the case be settled the employer often asks for a resignation. This is just something to keep in mind in terms of what decisions you'll need to make.  If you are no longer employed by the employer than a resignation is not something you should be concerned with. I have often seen claimants try to handle their claim without an attorney but navigating the Industrial Rules and workers' comp laws and - especially during the litigation process - is not easy. Thus when a claimant gets to this point in a claim they really should hire an attorney.  The good thing is that in NC workers' comp attorney fees are contingent  - meaning that the attorney does not get paid unless there are proceeds from a settlement or if the Industrial Commission issues a favorable decision for the claimant.  If you decide to hire an attorney be sure to seek an attorney who is reputable and get a consult to see if that attorney will take your case.  Good luck!"44244.5979166667 I had surgery  for a partially  torn  rotator  ### in March  of ###. After complaining  of pain for six months, the doctor  ordered another MRI.

When covid hit, travel stopped and my responsibilities  as a fixed asset tech were decreased. But their were several  employees  like me. For instance, one employee who is the events coordinator  was allowed to screen employees  for covid symptoms  for eight hours a day. I wasn't  given that option. All events have been postponed  due to covid but he and several  other  employees were given work. I was also still on light duty when my job was eliminated.  I need some advice please. Thanks for your time...44221.6986111111 I truly appreciate  your advice.  One more question.  Do you think I have a case for wrongful  termination? As I stated before, I was on light duty when my job was eliminated  however, they allowed people whose work responsibilities were stopped due to the pandemic , to continue working.  They were allowed to monitor  employees for eight hours a day and enforce  the covid guidelines the company  had in place. I was told they could not accommodate  my light duty restrictions.  And again, I was the only employee  who's job was eliminated.  And to make matters worse, they made me give everything  I was working on to three men, who are currently  doing my job. I sent an email to HR and asked if I was laid off, fired or terminated  and she responded  and said my position  elimination was not due to any fault of my own. I still have the email. They picked on me because  I was on Worker's  Compensation  and still refuse to pay any benefits.  Can I sue for wrongful  termination?44244.6569444444 North Carolina is an at-will employment state. This means that an employer may terminate an employee for any time and or any reason, or no reason at all. One exception to at-will termination includes wrongful termination. In the workers' compensation context - an employer may not fire employees for filing workers' compensation claims or exercising their rights under workers' compensation laws. This would be wrongful termination because the employer is retaliating against an employee because of the workers' comp claim.While I cannot state one way or another if you would be successful in a wrongful termination suit, as that would be a separate claim from your workers' compensation claim and governed by other laws, it is something you should bring up with the attorney (if you choose to hire one) so that you can discuss whether you have a viable case. There would need to be documentary evidence you can point to (such as the facts that you noted before) that shows the employer fired you because of your workers' comp claim. It wouldn't hurt for you to request your employee file to see if there is anything in there that would support a wrongful termination claim.  Note - If you hire an attorney they will most likely request your employee file during the discovery (evidence gathering) phase of the workers' compensation claim.  It's a lot more complex than it sounds to prove a wrongful termination case and there are certain time requirements that you need to abide by for filing a suite - but, again, it is something worth bringing up with an attorney that will help you navigate the complex process.  44244.6840277778 You have been EXTREMELY  helpful  and I can't  thank you enough  for your time and advice ðŸ™‚44244.6895833333 I am representing myself pro se after my attorney withdrew due to the fact that he did not properly inform me of the process.I just have questions regarding the motions that were filed after the hearing as I do not fully understand the verbiage or my rights accordingly.Is it possible to receive an email or phone call?Thank you!44226.6402777778 This forum is for the public to post questions seeking generalized legal information and for attorneys to answer those questions by providing generalized legal information.

It appears to me that your case was not handled properly. In North Carolina, attorneys are governed by the North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct.Here is a link to the full text of those rules.chapter ###.pdf (state.nc.us)The Rules of Conduct also specifically address how a lawyer may withdraw from representation. Here is a link to that specific rule:Declining or Terminating Representation | North Carolina State Bar (ncbar.gov)Although the individual attorney representing you left the firm, the law firm itself was still representing you and had a duty to diligently work your case until it was allowed to withdraw. The firm sent you a letter in ###'t represent you going forward but the North Carolina Industrial Commission did not order that the law firm could withdraw its representation until ###21. It is also not clear if you received proper notice of the firm's motion to withdraw so that you would have had an opportunity to respond to it.Therefore, I think that despite the firm's ###, it still had a duty to handle your case until the ###. It also had a duty not to prejudice your case with its withdraw. If the firm breached those important deadlines before the ###, then it should be responsible for those breaches.At this point, I would consider contacting a legal malpractice attorney. Here is a link to one such firm but you can do a Google search and find others. I would talk to ### ###.North Carolina Legal Malpractice Attorneys | ### & ### (###and###.com)After checking with a legal malpractice attorney, I would consider contacting the North Carolina State Bar about filing a grievance. If an attorney takes your case, he or she can guide you through that process. If no one takes your case, you will have to pursue it yourself. Although a grievance probably won't get you any financial recourse, it could give you some justice or help in holding the firm accountable.Here is a link on how to file a grievance.Filing a Grievance | North Carolina State Bar (ncbar.gov)44270.5597222222 Received a disengagement letter nearly ###.found out after i called for updates, email stated call this number and it advised atty. had left firm. another attorney at same firm states  my case not worth time and money.

I was second guessing  my thoughts.  I am so grateful for your response. And yes I will pursue. God bless and God bless the work and advice  your website and attorneys allow lay people have privy to. Again THANK YOU!!44273.6 Hi Ms. ###. I'm sorry this process has been so difficult for you. Oftentimes, clients have applied multiple times before they are approved. I noticed that you stated that you go to the doctors on a consistent basis. Would any of your treating providers be willing to complete a medical source statement for you? Or put another way, would they provide you with a favorable opinion stating that due to your impairments, you are unable to work on a consistent basis. I know that sometimes having a doctor support your disability claim can make a difference in the outcome. If you have never had an attorney to assist you, it may be helpful. With an attorney, they can handle all the legwork for you: gathering medical records, coordinating with the disability agency, and preparing your case in a concise way to help put your most severe impairments up front for the agency/judge to see. Best wishes to you and I hope this helped guide you in the right direction. Please ask if you have any further questions. 44287.7569444444 Okay thank you so much for getting back with me I have asked and begged numerous doctors in the past, but none of them would ever do this I don't understand why. I guess I'm at the point where I'm going to have to go back to work or be homeless.I have exhausted all of my financial means for the past ###'m totally exhausted about the whole disability issue thank you for getting back with me44292.8291666667 i have filed disability case for ###. only to be denied ###-###. i cannot accept this denial as i have give superior documentation for my health, physical & mental issues. i have gone to the doctors on a very consistant basis since 2009. i know that with all of my issues i should qualify. i know tons of people that barely have any issues & got it right away. they sit & laugh at how they munipulated the system and lawyers into getting approved.i am sick almost on an everyday basis between my ### & in the bathroom, my vertigo keeping me in the bed & vomiting & so dizzy i cannot even walk, my depression & anxiety also keeping me in the bed & hating to be around others, my ### which make inmobile, my chronic consistant sinus infections which ususally turn into bronchitis & pnuemonia at the same time keep me at home in the bed  or at doctors/urgent care begging for antibiotics, my buldging disc & degeneartive disc & extreme arthrits in my lower back which give me extreme pain with sitting, standing & walking & keep me from bending, or lifting anything heavy.Im in constant deperssion and anxiety with all of these issues and cannoh hold down a full time job..I think i could work part time, but i am out alot with all of these issues. i call in sick, i leave early, i call in late. im constantly at some doctors office with some of these issues..no employer is going to deal with me losing so much work all the time.that's the whole reason why i was filing for disability, so i could be able to pay my bills, and maybe work a part time job somewhere, and if i was fired like i have been before, i would still be able to stay afloat without losing everything and being homesless...i am not married and live alone & i have no one to lean of for financial help.i hope that i have explained this in detail so you understand my desperate need for this benefit. please call me if you have any questions that i have not explained. thank you so much.!!!most sincerely, ### ######TERM0013###-###44270.8048611111 Hi. Are you currently incarcerated? If so, how much longer are you anticipating before your release? Generally, incarcerated persons are not entitled to disability benefits. If you are currently out, try reaching out to an attorney to assist you with your claim. You can contact the NC Bar and request a referral to an attorney that represents clients seeking disability benefits. An attorney can assist you with preparing your case, requesting medical records, and finding the best argument for your case. Are you currently receiving treatment for your mental health issues? It's always helpful to have a doctor be supportive of your claim for disability. If they are willing, you should ask if they would be able to write/complete a medical source statement on your behalf. This document would list your impairments and limitations that would prevent you from working. Good luck to you. 44333.8770833333 I filed for SSI in October of ### ### ### hours after i filed for SSI they called me back and said i was denied....I currently take ###, Unspecified Psychotic and Manic Anxiety.

When you are awarded benefits, you are required to update the SSA on any changes in circumstance which may include among other things, changes in address and if you are receiving SSI, changes in income. It is possible that the SSA did not receive notice of your move from ### to Hickory.If you received a letter from the Hickory SSA that indicates that you are denied benefits and have the right to appeal, you may do so by contacting either the SSA or retaining an attorney to assist you. Please note that the time for appeals has a specific deadline, you may need to act expediently to keep your case moving forward.Best of luck to you in your future endeavors.44383.86875 i don't have a pending case, i lived in ###,nc and hired an attorney because i am unable to work any more due to mental disabilties.... i went to court and the judge declaired me permentaly disabled and i started getting social security disability in ###, NC. i move up here and the office here is taking everything from me and saying that it was not done right in ###, NC. i feel like my rights are being taken away by what they are putting in the computer here in Hickory,NC and they are changing everything, i feel that i need HELP44298.7819444444 Do i need to be declaired diabled all over again? once they put something in a ### you can't change what they have done ### i get an attorney involved44298.7840277778 Hi. My first question to you would be are you currently working? If so, there would not be a reason (yet to file). If not, have you already been diagnosed with a seizure condition? You would need to show that you are unable to work on a consistent basis due to your impairment ie, the seizures. The NC Drivers question is better suited for your physician. We would not be able to answer your monthly income benefit question on this portal as we would not know your work history/credits, etc. Hope this helps!44333.88125 My doctor and a specialist, Arvind M Gomadan MD, suspect that I may be having seizures and have prescribed a generic medication, Levetiracetam (Keppra). They are scheduling an MRI and an ### EEG W/O Computer to monitor my condition over time.My question deals with a medical disability. If it is found that I am having seizures would I be eligible to file for Medical Disability? Would I receive health care coverage? Would I totally lose my NC Driver's License?

You can learn more about these rules in the SNAP Advocacy Guide, ###43228.8479166667 Hi Ms. Hill -- I haven't heard from you about whether you and the other person are currently getting SNAP and, if so, if you are getting it together or separately.  Without knowing this, I can't give you a specific answer to your question. Instead, the following is general information about the SNAP household rules.If you live with other people, they are part of your SNAP household when you buy and share or prepare food together most of the time. DTA usually counts the income of everyone in the SNAP household, including unemployment,  when deciding whether a household can get SNAP and, if so, how much they can get.Some people (including spouses and children under the age of ###) must be in the same SNAP household even if they are not buying or preparing food together. There are also special rules if someone has a disability or is elderlyHere is more information about the SNAP household rule: ###The rules are different for other benefits programs including ###.You can contact the Project Bread Food Source Hotline, ###/ 1-800-###, if you want to talk with someone about possible eligibilty for SNAP.  However, only DTA can make the final decision about whether you are eligible for SNAP and, if so, for how much.I hope this helps.43228.8479166667 Hi Ms. Hill --Before I can try to answer your question, I need a little more information.Are you and the other person currently getting SNAP benefits?If so, are you both in the same SNAP household and getting SNAP together or are you each getting the SNAP separately?

Sometimes there s a delay in stopping the SSI payments and Social Security will charge you with an overpayment and ask you to pay back any amount you received by mistake - even if it''s Social Security's mistake. If you receive SSI benefits, there is a reporting requirement that you notify Social Security about the payment.   This is a link to the Mass Legal Help Disability information page - you may find this information or the links useful.###I hope this is helpful.###43228.8472222222 i am currently getting survivors benifits under my deceased father because i am on a ### case (disabled adult child) and was wondering if there are any limts on how much money i can have in a bank account ? because i may be getting a settelment check in for 10,###.43228.8472222222 I have just started receiving cash benefits due to disability and SSDI pending, and the father of my daughter has just paid a lump sum child support payment towards arrears of $43,000 ( not including penalties, interest or welfare) of $1000.

Thanks.43228.8472222222 Ms. ###You mentioned a $43,###; I am assuming that money is owed to you and not to DTA because you said just started receiving cash benefits.If the father makes a lump sum payment, he should make the payment through the DOR/CSE which is the MA Dept of Revenue / Child Support Enforcement.  If the father makes the payments through DOR/CSE, DTA and DOR will work out when and how much to pay you so you continue to have money coming in regularly from one source or another. There is a $50 pass through" amount that you should receive any month that the father makes a child support payment. (If he pays at least $###)If the father begins making regular payments if the child support is more than the cash benefits DTA will close your benefits case and you will receive the child support.If the money is owed to you you should receive it.  I'm not sure when and how but you should receive it.  When and how you receive the money depends on the current child support order the amount of your cash benefits and the timing of the lump sum payment while you are receiving cash benefits.You can speak to someone in Customer Service at DOR/CSE and they will be able to tell you what has been paid and what DOR will send to you.  that number is 1-800-###.I hope this is helpful###"43228.8472222222 I was signed up with Mass Rehab, had a case manager and a plan = I was enrolled in the ticket to work".

I filed a request to ### SSI and they gave me $###/mos. [May to Dec. 2015]Their claimI didn't report address change [I did - It was a maiing address]They overpaid me, but weren't suppost to, because I was iin a Nursing Home [### ###16].  [Approved by Ms. ###, SSI - ### 43228.8479166667 Ms. ###,When SSI is claiming that you were overpaid, you have a few options in ###s of how to handle that claim.  First, I will describe those options and what you need to accomplish under each option to be successful.  Second, I will describe the appeal process generally should you choose to dispute the claim.  When contesting or appealing an overpayment allegation, it may also be helpful to get specific legal advice from a pro bono SSI clinic in the area.  If you believe that you did report the address change and that this is SSIâ€™s mistake, then you may request a reconsideration or a waiver to avoid having to return the claimed overpayment.(###000487) When SSI claims an overpayment, an SSI recipient can either pay the overpayment, request an alternative payment plan, request a waiver, or request reconsideration and be prepared to appeal an unfavorable decision.Based on your question, you disagree with SSIâ€™s claim that you were overpaid.  If that is the case, then you should consider both requesting reconsideration (appeal the overpayment) and requesting a waiver to best ensure that you are not required to return any funds to SSI.  That said, let me start by explaining how to (a) request a reconsideration and (b) request a waiver.(a) Request for Reconsideration: This is another ### for an â€œappealâ€ of an overpayment.  It is how you communicate to SSI that you think they are wrong about their finding that there is an overpayment.  In most cases, you will either be disagreeing with the amount of the overpayment, whether there was an overpayment at all, or whether SSI adequately explained the overpayment to you.Deadline: You must file the Request for Reconsideration within ###, and SSI assumes that you receive your overpayment within ###. Thus, you have ###.  However, if you want to avoid SSI taking any money out of your checks because of the claimed overpayment, you should file as soon as possible after receiving the notice (within ###0004870+5 (###0004875) days of the Notice of Overpayment letter date).  If you fail to file within ###, SSI can take ###0004870% of your totally monthly income out of your SSI checks.Form: To file a request for reconsideration, you must fill out SSA-56###000487, which is attached to this message, and submit it to your local social security office.Process: When filing for a Reconsideration, you may ask for one of the following three types of review: (a) Case review, where an SSA worker reviews the papers in your file and makes a decision based on those papers; (b) Information conference, where you meet with the decision maker from SSA in person to go over the file, give new information, or to tell your side of the story; and (c) formal conference, where you can bring witnesses to help present your case to a SSA worker.(b) Waiver: When an overpayment happens that is not your fault and that you cannot afford to pay back, you can ask for a waiver.  For example, if you failed to report a change in your income on household to SSA because you did not know you were supposed to report the change or if you did tell your SSI representative and they did not record it, then SSA may waive your payment. Automatic Waiver: If you request a waiver and the amount is less than $###, then SSA should automatically waive your overpayment.Deadline: Waivers do not have the hard ### (could wait to file a waiver if the reconsideration is denied). However, the waiver request should be filed within ###.Form: To request a waiver, you can file SSA-6######000652, which is attached to this message, and submit it to your local SSA office.Process: As a general matter, to successfully achieve a waiver of an overpayment claim, an SSI recipient will have to (i) show that the overpayment was not the recipientâ€™s fault, and (ii) that forced repayment would create an undue hardship on the SSI recipient, resulting in an inability to meet everyday living expenses.  After you file the waiver request, SSA will review the form and any documentation.  If SSA cannot approve your waiver on the documentation alone, you will have a meeting called a â€œPersonal Conferenceâ€ where you can justify your position and figure out why SSA is not approving your waiver.  At the Personal Conference, you can present additional documentation or witnesses.  If your waiver is denied, you can also file a Request for Reconsideration within ###.(###000652) If your Request for Reconsideration is denied, you should seek out counsel to assist you in the following appeal process.Administrative Law Judge: If you disagree with the reconsideration decision, you may request an ALJ hearing by filling out Form HA-### ###. If you want to continue receiving SSI during the appeal, it must be filed within ###.  You may appear either in person or may ask for the ALJ to decide on a file.  The ALJ may ask for witnesses, medical exams or tests, and additional documentation when making a decision. SSA may assist you with this process.Appeals Council: If you disagree with the ALJâ€™s decision, you have to fill out form HA-### ###. Again, the Appeals Council can consider new evidence and either decide the case or return it to the ALJ for further action.  SSA may assist you with this process.Federal Court: If you disagree with the Appeals Council decision, the only remaining recourse is to file in federal court within ###. For this, a lawyer or legal aid group would be very helpful since SSA will not assist in the process.(###) Sources to get SSI legal aid in Massachusetts: Greater Boston Legal Services (###); Mass Legal Services (###).Please let me know if you have any more questions and I will leave the thread open for a few days to follow up.Best,### Das, Esq.43228.8479166667 Hi ### you very much for your response. It definitely helped clarify for me that I did meet the definition of disabled at the time of the injury in 2008. I've attached the CT scan report from prior to the surgery and the surgical report, both of which were never received by SSA, to illustrate the extent of the physical damage. I also was not allowed to bear weight for ###. Once I was allowed to start walking I began to recover but quickly reached a plateau and within a year there was an obvious deformity of my leg again. Regarding non-exertional impairment, I pretty much was paralyzed mentally afterwards. Another set of records which I just now realized my lawyer never even requested but I can see from an email I sent her that I did list it among the records to obtain and have sent, was from a psychiatrist I started seeing ###'t drive in Los ### traffic. I also attempted to go back to work ###. My ### ### ###. Also, a year and a half later in ###. This was only a Monday-Friday 1PM-5PM job that I couldn't manage to keep. There aren't tax records of that though because my first and only check was the one they cut the day they fired me. I'm sure there is some record of me applying for the job or cashing the check though. Anyway, by ###10, the psychiatrist I had started seeing in Boston stopped prescribing my ADHD medicine and anxiety medicine because it obviously wasn't working since I still couldn't get a job and was back living with my parents." On a side note this past summer I requested a digital copy of my SSDI file from the ### SSA office because I wanted to know exactly what had been requested and received regarding records but they refused to give it to me. Are they able to do that?To answer your question about a prior claim there was none because I kept expecting that this wouldn't last much longer but instead I kept getting sicker. I know about the ### but with so many diagnoses since my claim that provide explanations for why I couldn't recover with the addition of finding out SSA never received the records regarding the surgery and never were even told to wait for records from the psychiatrist could this be one of those cases that has "good cause" for failure to appeal in a timely manner? I'm still within ###.Thank you again so much for your help and ###"43228.8479166667 In ### ### when I shattered my tibia and fractured my femur from a fall on a patio to an extent which my doctors said they only see in high speed collisions and child abuse cases.

If you received the decision in 2015, it appears that deadline has passed.I cannot determine from the question whether you applied to SSA for benefits more than once.  If there was a prior application, the regulations ### that SSA can re-open or re-examine an earlier application if it is within ###.  You can review these regulations at www.ssa.gov If SSA didn't look back at an earlier application, you can ask them to do that and consider an earlier onset date.As you know, SSA uses a five step process to decide disabilty. the first step is whether or not the person is engaged in subtantial gainful activity? (working and earning a certain amount)If not, does the person have a severe impairment?if so, does that impairment meet a listed impairment in the regulations?  there gainful employment? if it does, person is disabled.if not, SSA must consider past work and whether the person can do any of his/her past work if not , is there any work the person can do?It is very difficult to obtain a finding from SSA that there is no work a ### (i.e. a broken leg ad the inability to walk) Usually the SSA must find some non exertional impairment to make a finding hat person cannot perform any work.  A nonexertional impairment can be pain or a diagnosed mental illness such as depression.all of these steps and how SSA applies each step to an individual is in the SSA regulations.If you want to appeal your onset date, send something to SSA in writing (with your name, address, and last ###) stating that you want to appeal the onset date of your disabilty and list your reasons.This is a link to a list of SSA local offices in Massachusetts###Keep a copy of the letter for your records and the date you mailed it.  SSA will process the request in some fashion.  If you don't hear anything in a month or so, contact SSA again.  If it is denied, you can appeal the denial.I hope this is helpful.###43228.8479166667 Mr. ###:The only way to find out if it is good cause is to file something with SSA. One thing to think about, when SSA reviews a claim, they review the entire claim and SSA will tell you that: including their finding that you are disabled.Good Luck.###43228.8479166667 Hi ### -I am sorry that you are having such a long wait for the SSDI decision.

There is no requirement that you  wait any length of time before filing a new application, but you are right that this will only give you benefits as of the date of the new application.  I would suggest that you do that, but also appeal, which would give you the opportunity for retroactive benefits.  DTA appeals are scheduled relatively quickly, and you would be able to offer evidence of when your income stopped.  For the hearing, I would suggest that you get a written statement from the student you were tutoring (or the student's parent is he or she is a child) about when the income stopped.  Ideally this would be sworn before a Notary Public or signed under pains and penalties of perjury".

Volunteer work may disqualify you for disability benefits if it qualifies as â€œsubstantial gainful activity.â€  Substantial gainful activity is work that involves doing significant and productive physical or mental duties that are done, or intended to be done, for pay or profit.  The following government volunteer programs do not constitute substantial gainful activity: Volunteers in Service to America, University Year for ACTION, Special Volunteer Programs, Retired Senior Volunteer Program, Foster Grandparent Program, Service Corps of Retired Executives, and Active Corps of Executives.  However, I am assuming that the harbormaster assistant position is not part of one of these programs.  In general, whether other volunteer work constitutes substantial gainful activity depends on the following factors: (###) the nature of the work; (###) how well you perform the work; (###) whether the work is done under special conditions; (###) whether you are self-employed; and (5) the time you spend working.  Please be aware that the position could jeopardize your entitlement to benefits if the work is of a type usually done for pay, the physical requirements of the job indicate that you could work at the substantial gainful activity level, or you volunteer more than a few hours a week.If you need more help than MA Legal Answers On-Line, you can talk to a live person at this telephone hotline: 800-#########-LAWS (-5###97).I hope this is helpful and wish you the best.- ### M.43228.8493055556 I am a SSDI recipient who has been approved and on ssdi for about two years.

Their phone number is ###-###.  Or, if you want me to give them your phone number, I can ask them to call you.  If you want me to share your name and phone number, please reply and give me your phone number and also give me permission to share your contact information with the ERLI project of the Volunteer Lawyers Project.It sounds as if you have two problems with your SSI right now â€“ the overpayment and the cut off (they call this a termination).  I am going to give you some information now about appealing your termination, because you need to take action on that right away.  TerminationTo challenge the termination of your SSI, you will need to appeal.  The first step in an appeal is filing a request for reconsideration. You must file your request for reconsideration within ###.  SSA assumes that it takes ###, so you must make sure that the request for reconsideration is received by Social Security no later than ###. From what you wrote, it sounds as if you may have received a termination notice in January, so this deadline is coming up very quickly, so you must act soon. The safest way to file this request is to go to your local Social Security office and file the appeal in person.  Ask them for a date stamped copy of your appeal so you can keep a copy for your records.  Bring your original notice with you in case there are any questions. You can also file the request for reconsideration by mail, but you wonâ€™t have any way to prove that you sent the form in if it gets lost in the mail. Finally, it is now possible to file a request for reconsideration through the SSA website.  This is new, so if you do it this way, make sure to follow up with Social Security to make sure that they got the appeal. Here is the link to Social Securityâ€™s page about filing for a reconsideration:  ###  If you want to file online, click the blue Appeal Other Decision box.If you want to fill out a paper form, and bring it to the Social Security office or send it in the mail, you can print it out from this link: ###Here is a pamphlet from SSA about the appeal process:  ###Based on the information that you have provided, that you have a life insurance policy with a current cash value of $4600, you might currently be over the resource limit for SSI.  The resource limit for an individual is $2000.  However, there are ways to legally spend extra resources and requalify for SSI again.I'm going to wait to give you any more information, because hopefully you will be able to talk to ERLI.

If you aren't going to be together when your daughter calls, you might want to write and sign a note saying that you are giving her permission to talk with ERLI about your problems.

My mother was kind enough to take out the policy for burial purposes and I have never thought twice about it since then.  SSI knew about my policy as each year they do an income verification.  one of the questions each year is do you have a policy" and I always tell them yes I do and send them a copy.  I have not nor have I ever tried to hide the fact that I have a policy. Nevermind try to cash it and never knew that was an option. I was just informed as of January of ### $###.  I was told if you are on SSI any cash surrender is equivalent to money in the bank.  I have never tried to cash the policy in nor did I know I could and that is the truth. I just assumed it was for burial purposes.  SSI has discontinued my benefits because of this as of ###/### 28###.Sorry for this long story.  Anyway my question would be: Why didn't they ever tell me I could not have a policy of a cash surrender of ###'t even know that until they told me and if they knew that then why did they allow me to collect benefits for over twenty years?  My policy has never changed.  Also come to find out that the policy has not been in my legal name for the entire time I have collected SSI.  It is my middle name first and then my first name and it does not match my birth certificate.  SSI has both of these documents.  I never noticed it until SSI brought it to my attention.  I then called Metlife Ins Company and they told me that if anything happened to me that the policy would be null and void because it isn't my legal name so therefore it could not be used for burial nor any other purpose.  So should SSI have picked up on this? Again I have sent them a copy every year. And do I owe when they were overpaying me due to my cash surrender? Why would they shut off my benefits now after twenty years when I have always had the same policy?Thanks for any information you can assist me with."43228.8493055556 Hello,I receive ### benefits and have been filling out the disability paperwork. ### was never changes to EAEDC to be exempt.

The evidence is contridictory and it needs clarification.  The evidence is a medical source statement filled out by a doctor who made contridictory statements about my medical problems and the Administrative Law Judge for the Social Security Administration discredited his entire medical opinion at the social security disability hearing.I filed a civil action in U.S. District Court against the Acting Commissioner of Social Security to challenge the decision issued by the Adminisrative Law Judge to deny Social Security Disability Benefits, but I don't know how to go about addressing the medical evidence (Medical Source Statement) that the judge will examine when I go to court.

I just made my complaint on ### and I am still waiting for the summons to be issued.Thanks,### ###43228.8493055556 Mr. ###:The Social Security disability benefits process can be a long haul as you are unfortunately discovering.  I regret that your application has not (yet) been successful.  You are indeed very brave to be proceeding to federal district court pro se.  Here are some suggestions and information about the next steps of your appeal which I hope are helpful, before addressing your specific question.First, I understand that you have been unsuccessful at the agency level, losing both before the ALJ and then before the Appeals Council (AC).  (The appeal to federal district court can only be taken after you have received a  denial from the AC.)  From your email, I gather you've also taken the important and complicated next steps of preparing your Complaint for the federal judge and filing that with the Court.  Once you receive the summonses, you will need to follow the directions from the court to serve properly all the interested parties to the case.  Once that happens, the Government (likely represented by an Asst. US Attorney for the MA federal district court sitting in Boston) , will file an Answer and prepare the administrative record to file with the Court and to provide to you. Here's a link to some general information about the federal court process:###At that point, you will be able to see if the suspect medical report is included in the official record.  Since it was apparently introduced at the ALJ stage, it should appear. Procedurally the next step differs significantly from what would normally be the path of civil cases.  In essence your challenge of the SSA decision is an APPEAL.  Therefore there will not be a new trial; instead the federal judge will look at the record AND the statements/briefs filed by both sides, perhaps hold an oral argument, and then rule.  As you likely know, the federal court's review is quite limited:  if the Court finds that SSA's decision has substantial basis in the record (even if the judge might have decided in your favor), then the court will affirm the SSA denial (i.e., the court will reject your appeal).  However, if the court finds that there is not substantial evidence (a very hard test to meet) OR if the Court finds that there were errors of law or an abuse of discretion, then the federal court can intervene and decide in your favor.  As to the remedy, you should know that the relief a federal court typically awards even if the court finds for the applicant is a remand back to SSA to redecide the case; it is quite rare to have the federal court reverse the SSA and award benefits outright.  The whole federal district court appeal process can take some ###.As to your specific question regarding the flawed medical report, the time to try to challenge that report would be in your brief (think of it as a report to the judge where you outline for him why you think you should win).

Some lawyers may be willing to take the appeal on either a contingent fee basis or because there is a possibility that the court could award the lawyer fees paid by SSA.

I assume you are talking about transitioning to Social Security retirement benefits, but please let me know if you meant Supplemental Security Income or another program.Social Security disability benefits automatically convert to retirement benefits when you reach full retirement age.  Your full retirement age varies by the year you were born.  Because you are currently ###, you probably were born in either ### 1956.  The full retirement age for ### ### ###, while the full retirement age for ### ### ###.If you were to become ineligible for SSDI before your full retirement age, you could receive retirement benefits as early as age ###.  If you were born in 1955, you could receive 74.2% of the monthly benefit at age ### 92.2% of the monthly benefit at age 65.  If you were born in 1956, you could receive 73.3% of the monthly benefit at age ### 91.1% of the monthly benefit at age 65.  These percentages are lower if you plan to receive retirement benefits as a spouse.  If thatâ€™s the case, please ask me for more information about spousal benefits.Unless thereâ€™s a specific reason why you want to transition to Social Security retirement benefits, you should consider remaining on SSDI until the Social Security Administration automatically converts your benefits.  Your disability benefit amount is the same as a full, unreduced retirement benefit.  If you were to start retirement benefits earlier than your full retirement age, you would permanently receive a reduced amount of benefit every month. You can learn more about your eligibility for Social Security retirement benefits on the Social Security Administrationâ€™s website, and particularly at these webpages:############You can also find a legal aid lawyer in Barnstable County by entering your zip code at this website:###Best,### S.43228.85 I am ###, at what age can I transition to regular SS? 43228.85 Here is a link to a pamphlet from Social Security that explains how to continue your SSI benefit while Social Security considers your appeal.  ###Page ###:  If you ask for an appeal within ### you can also request that your payments continue while weâ€™re making a decision on your appeal.

But you should file your hearing request as soon as you can.Note that SSA can ask you to pay the money back if you do not win your appeal.SSA should keep your SSI payments going automatically if you asked for your appeal within ###. If you filed your appeal more than ### you can still ask SSA to continue your benefits during the appeal. You will need to show that you have "good cause" for missing the deadline to have your benefits continue while you wait for the appeal decision.  You will need to make this request in writing.

I'm beyond baffled by the notion of not accepting DNA; like I said to her, maybe the government is still stuck in the 20th century?  Anyhoo, it's all hanging on my getting to the courthouse...so I'd better hustle my bustle.  Thanks again, -e43228.8506944444 Hello, no need to reply, I received a notification from the site saying the question would be closed within ###'t do something.  Still haven't gotten to courthouse yet, on much needed vacation in Maine.  Will keep you apprised of results. Thanks again! 8-)43228.8506944444 I just had an amazing conversation with the rep.  First of all, she told me that Social Security will not accept DNA tests as proof of paternity (!!!??), but would accept one letter from his family, and one letter from my family, stating that ### felt he was my boy's father.  At first she told me they would accept an adjudication, but then realized that that would have had to have been before ### passed.  (I have zero interest in asking anyone from his family to write said letter-we were estranged, and frankly, I chalk even his sister contacting me, or putting my son in the obit, up to post event shock. We do things we wouldn't in hindsight when we're in the initial stages of dealing with a tragedy, sometimes...That sister MIGHT write said letter, but who wants to ask if they can help it?!).  But seriously...they'll accept OPINION over established science?! ... That's not all; when I directed the rep to the POMS link you provided, she said she couldn't look it up because of the 'lnx' and 'nsf', that when they look up poems it's usually two letters followed by numbers.It is worth my pursuing, however, as my son would be entitled to roughly $###. (Why they would think it would be OK to tell someone who is not related nor married to the decedent, calling about a child who is not, on paper, related to the decedent... This whole thing is making me sick to my stomach, frankly. That DNA thing is a real doozy.  ###, doesn't their practice open up generous avenues for fraud?!).Grumpily yours, -E43228.8506944444 I said that you do not need to establish paternity through the Massachusetts courts because SSA reserves to itself the right to decide if your son could inherit from the father under Massachusetts law.  They do not require a Massachusetts court determination and in fact do not consider themselves bound by what a Massachusetts court says.  (Many years ago, I represented a client in a Social Security case in which the issue was whether  a marriage was valid.  The Massachusetts court decided that it was, but SSA disagreed and denied the claim despite the court decision.)  If you could get the DNA testing done without going to court and presented that result to SSA, they would decide based on Massachusetts law.  However, if the ME will not release the material for the testing without a court order, you will have to go to the Probate and Family Court to get such  an order.  And I think it would be difficult to convince SSA without the DNA result in a case in which the father did not support.The pleading you would file in the Probate and Family Court is a Complaint to Establish Paternity, and in that case you would file a Motion for Genetic Marker testing.  The following article from MassLegalHelp.org has a lot of good information on this process.###Please don't hesitate to reply if you have further questions.  After the weekend I will have access to colleagues with more expertise in family law and Family Court practice.   (I started on this question because of my expertise in Social Security.)  I realize this is a very sticky situation for you and am happy to try to help as much as I can.  If I didn't want to answer questions I wouldn't have signed up.43228.8506944444 I think you've armed with everything I need to move ahead, other than I wonder if I won't run afoul of some sticky wicket regarding the fact that we're not dealing with DNA samples from a living person, but rather biological samples being held by the state?  I wonder if I or the state will need to inform the next of kin, or if there is another motion or petition waiting quietly in the depths...  Nevertheless, I shall move ahead with the process, and I'll keep the question open both for further questions, and to keep you apprised of developments and ultimate results.  Thanks very much for responding on the holiday, and for volunteering in general! 8-)-E43228.8506944444 I will try to reply further later today or over the weekend.43228.8506944444 My son's father passed away recently.  Several people told me my son was eligible for social security survivors' benefits (a notion that would never have occurred to me otherwise.).  My son's father is not on my son's birth certificate due to his (the father's) criminal record, most significantly the fact that he was a level three sex offender at the time of my son's birth He was also an addict, and, as a recovering alcoholic, both the nature of his active addiction, combined with dangerous actions while active, caused me to request that the Department of transitional assistance and the Department of Revenue NOT pursue him for child support.  Given these extenuating circumstances, is my son still eligible for survivor's benefits despite the fact that his father did not contribute to his support while alive? I need to know if it's worthwhile to pursue the traumatic process of proving paternity. (He was killed in a motor vehicle accident, so the Boston ME has biological samples that can be DNA tested.  I also have convincing circumstantial evidence.).Thank you for your time,###43228.8506944444 No need for reply-same thing, legal answers system saying it will close the question.  Still haven't made it to courthouse; no car + limited child care resources = delay.  Other issues have kept us one town over, too.   I'm going, though, I'm going!! Thank you!! Happy Father's Day, if applicable!43228.8506944444 OK.  I think we should keep the question open until we see what happens in ocurt.43228.8506944444 P.s. If you have inside scoop on getting ahold of local legal aide programs (serving the Cape or the South Shore), I would treasure that information.  I tried pursuing legal aide, and got absolutely...nowhere. Before finding this resource, my plan was to spend the entire day at the courthouse, speaking with the Lawyer of the Day, filing for indigency, shaking in my shoes in the courtroom while I waited to ask the judge if I could speak to him/her in private so as not to splash my sorry tale into the eager ears of strangers... The point behind not having my ex's name on the birth certificate would be rendered moot if I had to tell why in an open courtroom.  And the sad thing about that would be, my ex was one of the lucky level 3s whose status was removed thanks to the new sex offender regulations in mass. (I'll admit it, his status was how I kept track of him.  Gazing into a police photograph's eyes to see if they're a little more dead isn't healthy, I know, but we all have our secret spiritual scabs to pick...).

The only part I don't understand is where you say I don't need to pursue paternity through Massachusetts courts. I contacted the ME, as I erroneously thought there was a chance they could soon destroy their samples (they hold on to them for five years).  The ME informed me that I needed a court order for the test.  I plan on bringing all of my little shreds of circumstantial evidence (taken singly, they're not ### much, as we say, but cumulatively they do tell a convincing tale-we were even coplaintiffs on a housing court case at the same courthouse I need to go to...).  I know enough, thanks to that housing court case (I won it!!), to be overprepared when I go to court, and, much as I would rather not revisit all the sordid details (I know he sounds terrible in cold print, but he was just another human, being human...), I do have a faint hope that the family court judge will adjudicate that he feels there is enough evidence that the decedent was my son's father without having to spend the $400-$###.  Sooo...if i could trouble you yet again with my last two questions of the year, could you tell me a.  What the name of the motion or petition is that I should file to have the DNA test performed and b. What the name of whatever motion or petition would be that I would need to file to have a judge review the evidence I have? (Frankly, if the latter is going to make this process more painful and drawn out, I'd rather just skip it and cut to the chase with the DNA test.  I have the money for it, since I put the money from the housing court case away for my son...and again, I would almost just as soon just spend the money to spare my own psyche and soul.  I can't imagine a judge is going to spend valuable court time thinking about the case when it can be proved beyond a shadow of a doubt with a test, either...)  And this is a Family Court matter, yes?I've already set up a telephone appointment with Social Security.  Soonest begun, soonest done, right?  And I don't think they're going to tell me to 'come back when you're prepared' if I tell them I'm waiting on DNA results.  The really amusing thing is, I haven't the foggiest notion what my son is entitled to...but even a lousy $### ###.

I will look forward to hearing how things go.43228.8506944444 The system is demanding input or the question will be closed again, so 'ping' ... Busy getting a car on the road, haven't made it to courthouse yet. Have a fantastic Fourtha July! 8-)43228.8506944444 This is a very interesting question, and the correct is answer is that, yes, your son is eligible for Social Security benefits on his father's earnings record.  Under the Social Security Act and regulations,:  You may be eligible for benefits as the insured's natural child if any of the following conditions is met:(###) You could inherit the insured's personal property as his or her natural child under State inheritance laws, as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Under Massachusetts law, DNA results which show a ###% or greater probability of paternity are sufficient to establish paternity.  In turn, this would allow your son to inherit from the father, which would make him eligible under the provision of the regulations shown above.  This basis for qualification, unlike some of the others, does not require that your son was living with the father or that the father was supporting him. You do not actually have to do anything in the Massachusetts courts to establish the paternity or your  son's inheritance rights.  Social Security will make the decision itself based on Massachusetts law. It would be worthwhile for you to prove pursue the process of proving paternity, as the DNA result, along with your statements about the paternity and other circumstantial evidence you may have, will be enough.  Of course, there is no point to filing the application until you get the DNA results. Although I am confident of this answer,  you may still run into some difficulties with the claim.  If you do, I would suggest that you direct the attention of the claims representative to the POMS section identified below.  This deals with a very similar situation.

My elderly mother is getting her affairs in order and had a lawyer draw up paperwork to include myself and my ###. She will live there alone until she no longer can or she dies. Recently a family friend passed and with nothing in writing or any planning of any kind, his family was left with a nightmare of issues to deal with. I explained to her that I am worried that my benefits might be in jeopardy if my name appears on a Title search. (Forgive me - I rent and know nothing about owning a house or the process of willing it to children)I told her if it would be easier, to just leave my name off of this paperwork and when she passes my ### ### ###.Am I correct in my thinking or is there something I am unaware of ?  I need these benefits and really would not be able to make my bills if I was disqualified because the State or Government thought I owned a house and was lying about an asset.  I know my sisters will be fair and divide it equally among us. But I also don't want to make huge issues for us ###.I would appreciate any comments or information you can provide as I don't want my mother to sign any final paperwork before we are sure of things. She did bring this to her lawyers attention but he doesn't know much about the benefits and any possible ramifications.Thank you43228.8513888889 If you are collecting SSDI, this is based upon ones disability and not asset related.  Under the SNAP program this income based along with total assets being less than $###00###.  The annual income can not be over $######,760.###.  Under the ### program is based on little or no income; less than $###,### (###) bank accounts (###) cash and (###) other property.  One vehicle under $###5,000.###.Should your mother die with your name on the property, when it is sold, the proceeds from the sale may put you over the asset income for these programs.Taking this information into account, it is your decision as to what is best for you and your family.  Just bear in mind that increased income may affect future benefits.43228.8513888889 As I said earlier,  the last check your brother was entitled to, was the check for the month BEFORE he died.  The SSA is entitled to receive back any payment made for the month IN WHICH he died.  So the dispute must relate to benefits due for the month prior to his death.I am just guessing based on your prior emails but it sounds like you assumed your brother had no will so you filed a claim for the month owed with the SSA under the SSA rule that says that the SSA will distribute any money owed to a deceased beneficiary who died without a will to whoever would be considered the deceased heir under the state laws for intestate succession."The SSA paid you the amount (I assume the amount in question is relatively small just a month of your brother's benefit).  Then at some later point the stepdaughter contacted the SSA and made them aware that brother had a will an she was the the executor. It sounds like the SSA agreed paid her the amount due and then found you to be overpaid by the amount they had sent you.  They then apparently reduced your personal benefits by amount owed using the rules allowing for "cross-program recovery." (I do not know and have not analyzed whether they had a right o use that mechanism in this particular case.) I know you have a hearing coming up which I assume is either based on your request for review of the cross-program recovery and/or a request for a waiver of the overpayment on the grounds you were acting in good faith when you applied for and accepted the payment from the SSA since you were unaware of the will and further that even if the money had been paid by the SSA to the stepdaughter as executor you would have ended up receiving at least part of it as one of your brother's heirs under the terms of his will.Given a lack of information I am unable to say any more about the merits or best arguments for your upcoming hearing request and I doubt there is enough money at stake to warrant paying someone to advise you and/or represent you regarding the upcoming hearing.If you have time you may want to contact the judge's office and ask if you can meet with a staff attorney before the hearing so they can help you understand what the specific issues are for hearing and what you would have to prove to get back the money taken from you by the SSA.Good luck."43228.8513888889 Does a stepchild over ### (###), not ever adopted, have the right to the deceased stepfather's last sociial security check.  I am the stepfather's brother who received the last check. Social Security says I wasn't entitled to it. Now they want to take the money out of my social security check as an overpayment. Social Security says the stepdaughter is entitled to the check.43228.8513888889 First of all I am sorry for your loss.Im not sure I have enough facts for my answer to be correct but I see your questions as:###) Does the SSA really have the right to take back the last SS deposited in your brother's account###) Why is your brother's step daughter entitled to anything from the SSA as a result of his death?Re Q###: The general rule is that a person is not entitled to a SS check for the month in which they die.  Since benefits are sent out for a month after the month has ended, , assuming a person receiving SS benefits on their own earnings dies,  the SSA payment deposited the next month must be returned..RE: Q###: I am not sure what the SSA is saying the stepdaughter is entitled to as a result of your brother's death.  Perhaps she was receiving a benefit based on her stepfather's earnings (e.g., a Childhood Disability Benefit) , which means she would be entitled to the lump sum death benefits. In any case I do not think her rights have anything to do with the SSA's right to refund of the last check paid.

The grandmother applied for benefits and I was charged with fraud.

My brother suggested I find somebody to help me fight them.43228.8520833333 Dear Mr. ###:I am providing the following answer based on the limited information that you provided above. Given that information, it does not seem like the National Guard service from ### to ###, meets the ### requirement to qualify for Massachusetts state veteran benefits under Chapter ###. The one exception is if you sustained a service-connected disability during active military service.To explain in more detail: Generally, one of the criteria to qualify for Chapter ### ### â€œwartimeâ€ or ###-wartime period. For Chapter ###, ###, to ###, was a non-wartime period (except for those who participated in campaigns in Lebanon, Grenada, or ###). Unless you participated in the Lebanon Campaign during your Guard service, then you must meet the ### requirement. The dates that you provided for National Guard service (### to ###) amount to only ###. I will also note that, in order to qualify, National Guard veterans generally must have been activated under Title ### 32. There is one exception exception to the time requirement: if the applicant sustained a service-connected disability during active duty service, then the ### requirement does not apply.There is more information about the Chapter ###-help guide (http://www.legalservicescenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ch-###-Self-Help-Guide.pdf, also attached here) and on the Massachusetts Department of Veterans Services Website (###). Those resources cover, among other things, the other eligibility requirements for Chapter ### (such as residence, income, and assets).Please know that if you disagree with the VSOâ€™s decision on your application, you have the right to appeal. There will be important information about how to appeal and deadlines on the decision notice. I wish you the best of luck.Sincerely,### ###, Esq.43228.8520833333 I've  fill out  an  application  with  the Veterans Services Officer, And  was  wondering  about  the  ###  requirement,  If  I  served  in  The  National Guard  from  July  14  1982  to  October  21,  1982   would  my  application  be  denied?

If it was to terminate (end) your benefits becuase you no longer qualify and you lose the hearing, Social Security can stop your benefits.There is another appeal after the Administrative Law Judge but it's hard to do without a lawyer. That appeal is to the Appeals Council. Here is some information about the Appeals Council: ###. The time limit for appealing is ###. Social Security assumes you get the notice within ###, so the deadline for appealing is ###. If the case is an overpayment and you lose but you still qualify for SSI or SSDI, you can still get benefits but Social Security will take something out to pay back the overpayment.

Fortunately my parents provided us with shelter and suggested I go to DTA to apply for assistance since that requires signing over the child support case and would get a quicker, more thorough response from DOR since he's already in their system getting $220/wk taken out of his paycheck for a child from a previous relationship. He bounced around, never having an address to be properly served until he finally went away for treatment and contacted DOR on his own to cooperate since that was on my list of requirements to see our daughter.

But there is no higher authority" for you to go to with this kind of issue other than maybe contacting your Congressman which probably will not result in an immediate fix.I think you should go down to the SS office and ask them if the payment has been sent to the bank and if so why it isnt showing up yet.  If they say they havent made it yet ask that they make a "critical payment" today which should get you the money in your account within a few days.Once you get your benefits reinstated you will need to carefully consder what to submit in support of your appeal to maximize the chances of getting reinstated permanantly. Keep in mind that you will need to prove that the impairment which were present at the time you were granted benefits have not improved enough to allow you to return to work .  Also be aware that if a current impairment was not present and documented with medical evidence at the time of the original decision it will not be considered as part of the medical improvement analysis. ### ###"43228.8527777778 I was sent a letter stating my Ssdi benefits would stop, last check due 10###, because this issue was not reasons I applied for disability I filed an appeal & also wrote a letter requesting to receive my (dependents cut until appeal answer) benefit amount & medicare during appeal process.

I hope your husband is one of them.Regards,###### ###Law Office of ### ######, Ste 120, ###, MA  02460###-######43228.8534722222 Hello KI am an attorney in private practice and have been representing individuals in SSI and SSDI claims for ###.Sorry to hear about your husband's health problems. The short answer is that an attorney experienced in SS law can greatly increase the likelihood of success in many cases. I n the past while most claimants were denied initially and on reconsideration, the approval rate at hearing before an ALJ was quite high even without an attorney. So some people decided to save having to pay the attorney's fee (typically ###5% of past benefits capped at $6,000) by going before the ALJ on thier own and were approved. But some of those unrepresented claimants lost and might have won if they had been represented by capable reprentatives.In the past ###'s has plummetted and there the odds of winning without an attorney are much lower.So what does the atty do that increases the likelihood of success? Here is a partial list off the top of my head:###) Understand how the applicant's age, education, past work experience and medial restrictions fit into the various categories which the SSA uses to determine what kind of easier job the applicant would be expected to adapt to, even if they cannot go back to their usual work.###) Insure that all treatment records are obtained.###) Review the records to make sure they are accurate and complete4)If additional diagnostic studies or referrals might help the case, to encourage the applicants to discuss this with their providers.5) If the records contain ambiguous or unhelpful findings or comments to encourage the applicants to discuss them with their providers.6) To obtain narratives and/or forms from providers giving their opinions on the applicant's restrictions and limitations supported by their medical findings. 7) To prepare the applicant and any other withnesses for hearing8) To electronically submit all new medical evidence and other pre-hearing documents to the Hearing Office 9) To arange for the scheduling of the hearing###0) In appropriate cases to submit a pre-hearing memorandum to the judge######) To represent the applicant at hearing including eliciting testimony after the ALJ has asked their questions, and also to cross-examine any medical or vocational experts who testify at the request of the judge, and to argue the case at the conclusion of the hearing.######) To deal with any post-hearing issues which might include submitting additional medical or vocational evidence, and submitting a post hearing memorandum.######) If the deciison is favorable to make sure all post-hearing issues are dealt with so the the applicant and family receive all benefits to which they are entitled as soon as possible.###4) If the decision from the ALJ is unfavorable to review the case for appeal and if appropriate file an appeal with the appeals council.K, I hope you can see that an attorney who knows what they are doing can be very important in maximizing the chance of success.  If you agree you should consider calling one or more attorneys to discuss your husband's case, even if you chose to wait to retain an attorney until after you get an initial decision, or a decision on the first reconsideration appeal.  Good luck### ###43228.8534722222 My husband has opened a claim for disability benefits with the Social Security Aministration on ###.  He has severe and chronic medical issues that are preventing him from working now and are expected into the future as well.   We believe strongly that his medical history will support his claim. We are not expecting a determination of his claim until the end of ######.  Maybe longer.   It has been recommended to us to obtain a Disability attorney in the event that his claim is denied.My question is:  How can an attorney help with a denial and what can they do for us in appealing a denial that we would not be able to do for ourselves ?    Will having an attorney give us an advantage in appealing an unfavorable decision ?   We know nothing of this process or government benefit and are not sure how to proceed.   We are continually being told that most disability claims are initiallly denied and that most people have to appeal and wait for a long time in order to receive benefits.   It is important to us to be proactive in anticipating this possible result as his income was our sole support and has now ceased.    Thank you in Advance for your recommendations.Sincerely,K. ###43228.8534722222 Thank you for your timely response and recommendations.  I did not realize that so many cases ended up at the hearing stage befor the ALJ.  An attorney would be most helpful in that situation.

If you are receiving ### for yourself and your daughter) you will be able to get child care for your son (and after-school care for your daughter if you will need it) as soon as you have a job lined up (even before you actually start  the job). You can also get child care to do other activities such as job search or education or training.

I need a lawyer to represent  me for my diisability hearing.  I have not been given a date yet. How do I see if I qualify ffor a llawyer for my trial?43228.8534722222 Dear Sir,First, please accept my admiration for what you are doing to care for your son and your wife under very difficult circumstances.Assuming you do not have countable income or assets, you may be eligible for EAEDC benefits as the caregiver of your son (and possibly as caregiver for your wife if you are also needed to care for her). The benefits are low (maximum $303/month). (Unfortunately, EAEDC has a very low asset limit, so that could be a problem). Apply at your local DTA office. You will need verification from your son's medical provider that you need to provide constant care for your son in the home or he would be at risk of institutionalization.You may be able to increase your SNAP amount if they are not currently taking into account all of your household's medical expenses. Be sure to include any co-pays, deductibles, expenses for medical transportation, and any over-the-counter medicines, medical supplies, or similar items. If your medical expenses are more than $###. You may also be able to increase your household's deduction for medical expenses by having your son pay you for the care you provide for him. See ###  This link also includes a chart that can help you figure out whether claiming medical expenses will increase your SNAP benefits.  I am not an expert on ### eligibility. I believe that you may be able to qualify as your son's ### as long as you are not his legal guardian since he is now an adult. (You can be his authorized representative for SSI and still not be his legal guardian).  See ###.  However,  you should consider whether being your son's ### would mean that you would no longer get help from a non-family ###  and would get no respite for yourself. Best wishes to you and your family. 43228.8534722222 My son is permanently disabled and is now an adult at age 21. He has been home since 9/###-guardian with my wife. She does not/is unable to...provide any sort of care for our son. She receives SSI benefits and has for years. My son also receives SSI benefits. My son's disability occurred at age ### (anoxic brain injury). Prior to his injury, I was the working full time (manual labor). I did make good money but it was a job that provided no health insurance, retirement, sick time etc. The day this happened to our son (###), I stopped working, as I spent every day and night in the hospital by my son's side due to the severity of his illness. My wife was unable to assume this role as our daughter was only ###, and couldn't be left alone etc. After bringing my son home, I was able to collect a small check from EAFDC or ### which was for caring for my son on a full-time basis and being unable to work. Those benefits stopped some years ago, I am not sure we ever got a sufficient explanation as to why. Possibly my son turning ###?? Our income has not changed so it would not be income related. I remember providing medical documents and a signed form by his MD attesting to his condition and need for medical care and that I was providing this. I have read different things stating he should've converted to SSDI , which might increase his monthly income but I'm not retired and my spouse isn't deceased. It's confusing as to why I cannot receive benefits any longer from DTA, as the situation has not changed. I initially thought I could be paid through the Massachusetts ### program, as he is currently allowed ###/evening hours and ###. But according to the program I am unable to be paid in this manner due to my being his parent. I refuse to have my son in a nursing home as he is is happier and healthier at home with his family. The few months he was in a facility before coming home , he had multiple occurrences of aspiration pneumonia, was on medication for agitation etc etc. Although still disabled he has thrived at home with no pneumonia in years, decreasing meds etc. I also know how much more expensive it would be for ### to pay for his care in a facility. Is there any way to receive some type of compensation for the care I provide? Our family struggles daily with paying bills, buying food etc. My daughter also lives in the home and also receives SSI. We are all on ### and live in Wilmington family housing. We also receive just over $###. Thank you for any help you can provide43228.8534722222 ###.  I don't want to make you more anxious than you are already, but do tread carefully.  BSI investigations can lead to criminal charges,  so treat this as if you were being called into a police station.  Do not assume you know what they are after or where they got the information.  Let them ask questions.  Pause and think carefully before answering.   Do not volunteer information.  Answer the questions asked, truthfull, and as succinctly as possible.  If the investigation leads to a threat to cut your benefits and/or recover an overpayment, you will have other opportunities later on to debate whether the family help you received should disqualify you from public assistance.###. Tax refunds are not income to the extent that they are either money that was already counted" in your gross wages OR are an Earned Income Credit.  Loan proceeds are a gray area especially a loan from a relative not evidenced by a written promise to repay.  3."Income" can be either earned or unearned.  Cash you receive directly is income; on the other hand if someone pays a ### on your behalf  it is usually not considered income.  Money from your husband is  especially tricky because he may have a duty to support you (and children if any living with you); if you were living together all his income would be considered along with yours in any application for beneifts.  And considering how low welfare benefits are  from the state's point of view $300-400/month is more than incidental.

My elderly landlord has recently decided to close his house for the winter months and relocate to Florida.  He realized that I would have no place to go so he brings me with him.  I rent a room at the same price as up North.  I did my research and was told that, yes, I could use EBT out-of-state because it is a federal program.  I was told by a DTA worker that my state may give me a hassle and to use legal services to make sure I was doing everything right.  I am a good person and would never scam the system.  I count on it to survive.  Please answer these questions: May I use my card out-of-state?  If so, for how long?  If I decide not to use my card while in Florida, how long before I lose benefits by not using them?  I've been told that I could use my card in neighboring states but not Florida.  How could that be true?  One person told me I could use it out of state for one week, another said three monts or so." I know you get many questions and I thank you in advance for your help.  I'm borrowing money from family and friends so I can eat.  That is beyond humbling it's humiliating.  As a former school teacher I am a person who wants to "play be the rules."

I have my PCP, and Mental health provider willing to supply all information to support this diagnosis, I Spoke with one insurance company rep a few years ago they said i did not qualify, however they never requested my doctors information.

Thank you ### ###43228.8541666667 You should certainly apply.  The decision is made by the Social Security Administration, not by an insurance company, and the standards for disability under Social Security and under private disability insurance are not the same.   To qualify for Social Security or SSI disability you have to be unable to perform â€œsubstantial gainful activityâ€ because of a medically determinable impairment which has lasted or is expected to last at least one year.  When you apply, make sure you provide the Social Security Administration with full information on all of your medical providers and they will gather records and reports from them.  If you are turned down, you have a right to several levels of appeal (with a ###).  If you are denied, you may be able to get help from your local legal aid program, and there are also quite a few private lawyers who handle these cases.43228.8541666667 I then was sent to apply for mass health disability and was told I am denied and canâ€™t do my old job but can do something else.

I have already applied for and been approved for Commonhealth for her.  I have heard that the timing to apply for Social Security benefits is important but I don't know where to start or even if she would qualify.

In a two-parent household you need to show that BOTH parents are needed to care for the child. It sounds like you should be able to do this because the child needs round-the-clock  care so one parent needs to sleep while the other provides care. The forms signed by the doctor need to explain why BOTH parents are needed, for example, by including the schedule of care.Whether or not DTA was correct in approving the on-line course previously, DTA could still say now that it is not acceptable. And you could try to prove that it is acceptable and why.As you suggest, it might make sense for you to appeal. If you appeal within ###, your benefits should not be changed until a hearing decision is issued. You can try to provide evidence to DTA that both parents are needed as caregivers or that your on-line course should meet the work requirement before the hearing.  If you aren't successful, you can go to the hearing and try to provide the evidence to the Hearing Officer.It sounds like you are very capable but it is usually better if you have an advocate. If you decide that you need an advocate, you can contact your local legal services program.  The intake numbers for legal services are available at www.masslegalservices.org. The website also has the ### Advocacy Guide which has information about the how to prepare for a hearing. Best wishes to you and your family during this very difficult time.### ###43216.1298611111 Hello,We are a ###. We both have signed caring for the disabled forms from daughters PCP.

What is the effective date of the letter saying your EAEDC cash benefits will be stopped? If that date has not yet passed, you should appeal (request a hearing) immediately.  Your benefits should then continue until the hearing is held.  Meanwhile, you can continue to try to resolve the issue.  If the issue is resolved, you can cancel the hearing. ###.  Since you are receiving cash benefits you should have an assigned caseworker in the local DTA office.  The name and number should be on notices you received.  It sounds like your caseworker may not always be responsive, but the Assistance Line (###-877-###) will probably only refer you to the caseworker.  If you don't have or can't get the caseworker's number, you can get it from the Assistance Line, but as you know, that can involve long waits. ###.  If you have a smartphone or ipad you can download DTA Connect fromt the App Store and set up an account. You can then see whether DTA has received documents from you and whether they have been processed. ###. If you are having difficulty communicating with DTA because of your disability or you need help filling out DTA forms (or even if you just can't get through to your worker), you can call the local DTA office and ask to speak to the Client Assistance Coordinator. 5. You can call the DTA Ombuds Office for help, 6###7-###. The Ombuds is supposed to fix problems.6.  You can try to get a free lawyer to help you.  The intake number for the Eastern part of Massachusetts is 6###7-###.7.  While I agree that it is outrageous if DTA lost your information, I think it is unlikely that they have disclosed your private information in ways they should not have done. I wish you the best of luck and hope that dealing with DTA does not continue to be the full time job that it currently seems to be.Sincerely,### ###43222.9125 I've been trying to re-certify the EAEDC cash benefits I've been receiving.

Still waiting.It took me a couple weeks to finish these applications, it's not easy. I mailed it on due date!I received a letter that says my benefits will be stopped due to me not sending my application. Appears to be lost. I sent my application! Where are my applications? Who has it? My private info on my application has disappeared & in the hands of who? Because of them losing my application I pay the price. They've stopped my benefits. I have my rent do in a couple of days and I can't pay it. Because of them NOT me. I feel like giving up on re-certifying for my cash benefits. Additionally, the letters they mail me are poorly written and bombard you with letters., adding more confusion. I've asked my friends to read & figure out what they want.I did what I was supposed to do, but because they lost my application. I am penalized due to their neglect. All my private info has been lost/exposed. I'm not okay with this. It seems to me that if I want the cash benefits I have to do applications all over again. And this time I will do it online. But if it wasn't for them losing my applications I wouldn't have to do it again! And did I mention I can't pay rent, I don't have rent money? How will my landlord understand?And I've been searching online as to where I may file a complaint about their lacking of help & losing of my EAEDC application.

Like, my mom hasn't even paid it for ###, my sister paid ###'s not even on.I can get the letter from my mom, but it just seems strange the way she talked to me.

It need not be reported to DTA since it is not countable income. If you keep the inheritance in an interest bearing account, the interest becomes an ongoing source of income and does need to be reported at your next interim report if the ongoing interest payments cause your income exceeds a certain amount; review your DTA paperwork carefully for more informationIn a very tiny set of SNAP cases, seniors or persons with diabilities who get SNAP, but whose income is over ###00% of the federal poverty level ($###,###) may have assets taken into account.   If you would like to speak to someone about SNAP payments, you can  contact ### ### at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute for a free consultation about your question.

I'm asking because she helps me pay my bills by allowing me to put money into her account and I don't want that to go against her. I don't see why they would need the actual transaction history. She gave him a bank statement with all the account information but removed the transaction history and told her they need the transaction history43284.0395833333 Hi,If you are applying for or receiving cash assistance and have a bank account, the Department of Transitional Assistance can ask to see the bank account details to see if there is money going into the account that might be considered income which would be counted in figuring the amount of cash assistance.As you seem to be anticipating, it will be hard to persuade DTA that the money you are putting in her account is your money, not her money.  You don't say if you are the father of any of her children, but if you are, things are even more complicated. One option would be for her to close the account.  If she wants to have a bank account she can open a new account and not allow you to put money in the new account.  She does not have to have an account to get cash assistance but if she does have a bank account DTA rules require that she get her benefits by direct deposit. If you want to help her, and you are not the father of any of any of her children, you can give her money that is for a specific purpose (e.g. rent) as long as it doesn't cover all of the costs, or you can pay part of the cost directly. If you are the father of any of her children, you can pay ###s directly, as long as you don't pay the entire ### for rent or utilities. If there is a problem because of the money you have been putting into the account until now (for example, if she is charged with an overpayment) she can contact us and we can try to advise her. I hope this information is helpful to you. 43287.6645833333 Good evening:  I presume you are referring to Social Security Disability.  Yes, bipolar can be a condition for which disability is awarded.  The nature of your particular condition, the treatments available and your ability to work or not, when on medication will all be relevant.

Once the attorney has the basic description he or she will be able to tell you what is needed for your specific case.Good luck.44118.9118055556 I am starting the process of applying for disabilities and I want to make sure that my condition is covered, right paperwork is filed, medical records, etc. What do I need before I consult an attorney?44118.9055555556 CONCLUSION/WHAT YOU MUST DOBased on your letter from the State of Florida Department of Children and Families (Palm Beach County), you have an open application from ###.

From your description of this sad situation it appears that the restitution" you were ordered to pay ###--long before you began receiving Social Security benefits--must have been related to some serious federal crime you committed ###--because the only entity that can garnish Social Security payments is the federal government. This sad situation also suggests either that the restitution amount ordered must have been very substantial and/or that you were unable to pay it (or did not pay it). In either event the only ways you will ever get the federal government to stop gabbing $### (###) to convince them to stop based upon humanitarian reasons or (###) to go back to the same federal court that ordered the restitution and try to apply to that court for leniency. Look for free legal assistance in your local community--Broward County--by Googling "free legal aid services" and then calling some of the local legal aid organizations there.        "44141.6513888889 Thank you for your reply. Please review the two attachments I sent you. Doesn't it say that social security cannot be garnished if it is directly deposited?  In my case, my meager SS retirement goes directly to my direct Express card. Please reply.Thank you very much 44141.6888888889 Whether your Social Security payments are deposited directly or not has nothing to do with the advice I gave you. Can you imagine how many debtors would love to learn that they can completely avoid collection efforts forever just by having ALL their income deposited electronically? Really? HEAR THIS  ADVICE AGAIN: ###.  The federal government already has complete control over your Social Security income.###.  They get to decide whether you are entitled to any of it, and how much they want to send to you and how they want to send it to you. Period.  ###.  As long as you owe them a Buffalo nickel they WILL take it from ### way or another--until all of it is paid in full; or until you convince them to stop.   44141.90625 Did you report your injury and did they provide you with medical care?44145.1194444444 I was hurt on my job over a year ago I was jammed up in the conveyor belt would I still be able to sue or I waited to late because I done start having issues with my arm again44145.1055555556 Ok thanks44145.1347222222 Yes I reported my injury and yes they provided me with medical care but me being injured was on them because they had an issue with the conveyor belt and Maintenance was suppose to come and fix it but never did44145.1215277778 You are limited to workers compensation benefits against your employer and can go back to see the doctor they authorized you to see.

I don't believe SSA has retained the information you gave them since they regarded the application as not being filed. You do have to file a new application and with the new online procedures to do so, I hope you wont' find it too difficult.In 40+ years of representing clients with Social Security/SSI claims I have never had a similar client, so I can't say for sure that they have or don't have the application.Even if they have it, they're going to require that you answer all the questions on the new application both to bring it current, but also because the application has to be all complete in one spot.44153.9895833333 i applied for ssi suplemental income about ###. i had to withdraw my application because of my life situation...they approved  my withdrawell...it said that they 'Will treat the application as if you did not file... i now have to file another application...i...does the ssa have a copy of the old application on file ???? ... or all the imfo i gave them ###?????44149.5388888889 As other competent lawyers will tell you this very important situation cannot be solved here online.

However, you should have received a notification of the benefit award which contained information about your right to appeal or challenge the decision.  You are permitted to request a Fair Hearing".  If you need the assistance of an attorney you should contact the local legal aid society to apply for assistance.  I don't know whether they will assist you but they are your best starting point.

Unemployment is granted when someone is terminated or laid off by their employer.44215.6486111111 Good morning:  I'm sorry for your difficulties.  However, you can not make a claim against Social Security for the circumstances you described.  You can either file a new claim for disability and go through the process, or, if you are within the appeal times to do so, file an appeal.  From what you stated above, though, it sounds as if you may have been at the end of the process.  I can't tell what happened during your case.  However, you should get a different attorney if you were not happy with the way the last attorney handled the case.  It would be wise, even though  you have an attorney, that you make sure you have all the medical records you need for the initial application and any appeal from a negative decision from the initial determination.  Start taking action now to make sure you know what you will need as well as being able to provide it to the SS department or to the administrative law judge during the appeal.

In order to qualify for survivor's benefits as a divorced spouse you must have been married to the decedent for ###.  However, as the ex-wife of the decedent who is caring for the children of the decedent you are entitled to a survivor's benefit.  It is a reduced benefit because of your age, and may also be reduced because of a cap for a family's benefits,, but you should contact the local Social Security Office for an appointment to go over the benefits available to you and make application for them immediately - for both you and your children. Here's a link that you should review - https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/ifyou.html     It spells out the benefits for your situation.Good luck. 44253.5444444444 Hi my ex husband passed from heart attack. We had been married for ### 29. We have ### ### 10. They got survivor benefits. I was told because we hadn't been married for ###'t qualify. Now everyone is saying that's crazy i was because they were so young is that true44253.2958333333 Dear Ms. ###,It sounds like you are applying or have applied for ### for your granddaughter through the Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) to help cover her expenses. You are correct that in general the state will seek child support from the parents of any child on whose behalf ### is paid and will expect the adult receiving the ### for the child (in this case you) to help get the support. I can't tell if you are currently barred from seeing your other grandchildren or whether you are afraid you will be barred if the state pursues reimbursement for ###. I understand that you are afraid that you granddaughter will be prevented from seeing her sister. I am so sorry you are having to go through this when you have heroically taken on the responsibility of caring for your granddaughter.  First, you might want to ask your lawyer if your granddaughter might have a legal right to visit her sister even if their father could prevent you from visiting. Second, you may have good cause not to pursue child support.  Tell DTA that you do not want to pursue child support from the father because of his threat that he will prevent your granddaughter from seeing her sister and that would cause her emotional harm."  DTA may ask you for "verfication."  A therapist or social worker can verify the risk of emotional harm.  Or you can get statement from a friend who knows your situation. If you don't have anyone who can verify the emotional harm ask to see a DTA "domestic violence worker" who may help you.  It is unusual for DTA to say you have to pursue child support if you can show there is risk of emotional harm.  But if DTA doesn't agree you can always close the ### case. Note that if your granddaughter is getting ### she will also be covered by ### so maybe her dad would set some money aside for her college or other expenses instead of paying the medical expenses. I hope this is helpful to you.  I wish you the best in dealing with this."43292.8472222222 I am a grandparent with legal guardianship of my granddaughter (###). Her father would only pay for reasonable medical as part of the guardianship agreement.As any teen has expenses, and she also is in the dual enrollment program and starting at HCC. For the past ###. When we started this process, his wife told me that he said he would not allow me to see my other grandchildren. My lawyer told me he has the legal right to do so. It would be pychological devasting for my granddaughter that lives with us if she could not spend time with her younger sister. They are very close.Will the state go after her father for reimbursement of the TANDC?43288.5298611111 Dear ###, Unfortunately, the income you receive during your internship does indeed count towards the household's total income.  This is the case of any child under age ###.  Once the internship ends, your family should immmediately report the change to get SNAP benefits boosted to their previous level.

Is there anything I csn do so that my family gets the normal amount that they usually get?43294.8 Hi, ###,  SSI doesnt pay dependents benefits but if your child's father had worked enough prior to his death to be covered by Social Security, than if you can prove that he was the father of your child, your son would be able to collect and maybe even get back benefits since you were possibly given misinformation by the SSA when you first inquired.  So the key questions are:###) Is there proof of paternity ?###) Do you know if the father was insured for SS, or maybe was even collecting SSDI at the time of his death?### ###43312.6854166667 My son is ###, his father passed away suddenly when i was ###. I was told recently from an attorney this is wrong and he is eligible. What can i do now that it's been ###? Is he still eligible?43311.5763888889 Then you should go to the SSA and ###) file a claim for child's benefits for your son since you say you can prove paternity even though the father is not on the birth certificate. Also you should request that your original inquiry after the father's death as the date of the claim since your efforts to pursue the claim at that time was prevented solely due the misinformation say you received from the SSA staff.If you want to try to find an attorney to assist you with this matter you could try calling the referral service at the National Organization of Social Security Claimant Representatives (NOSSCR) at www.NOSSCR.org.Good luck.### ###43312.825 Yes i can prove hes the father and he did work and was insured because he had another son from prior relationship that gets benefits.43312.6881944444 I need to know if I can still collect SSDI even if I have an over payment. I have not worked for eight months. 43313.6458333333 Thank you.43313.79375 Without knowing the background of how and when the overpayment occurred, when you received benefits and any appeals or waiver requests you filed, and how long it haan s been since you last collected, it is hard give any advice.But in general the answer is that if you are otherwise entitled you can collect SSDI despite a pending overpayment although you will probably have part of your benefit deducted as a monthly intstallment payment against the overpayment balance.### ###43313.7791666667 I am not sure what you are asking.  Are you saying you did not know aobut these accounts and that you are trying to get information from the Social ### Administration?  Or are you asking aobut the effect of these accounts on your SSI?  If you can provide more explanation I can try to answer.43330.5819444444 SSi has information about ###. One of them is more than $###.### $500.###. I found this out while ### to get more benifits. They said they don't have the infor or give it to me.43327.7694444444 My pseduo-mother is a Tibetan immigrant. She is a US citizen, but her Social Security card has the year of her birth incorrectly printed. She has no physical birth certificate. When she came to the US, she was asked what year she was born and she did not remember, so they printed a date making her ten years younger than she is in reality. Her mother now lives in the US and can attest to the fact that she is actually ###, not 50. Her dentist has remarked that her birth year is incorrect based on how her teeth are. What can she do to adjust her SS card?43330.7006944444 I became legal guardian for ### ### in late ######. I had temporarily of the ### children from July - ###17, while their sister ### had guardianship over them.  ### took guardianship over her siblings in ###.  ###16, all three of ###â€™s sibling Came to live in my home where ### and her one year old daughter were already living. In July, 20###, I applied for ss benefits for ### as suggested by DCF.  I received a notice from ss on ### stating ### ### For ### ### owes $1,315.###.  Money due back to ss by ###.  I went to the SS office only to be told even though I did not receive any money for ### or his siblings, I still owe this debt to SS. Not to whine but I have supported ### and his siblings while they lived with me with roof, heat, lights, clothes, food, activities and transportation.I believe Iâ€™m being punished for doing a good deed. Can you advise me on how to go forward in this matter?43340.6784722222 One other thought - if SSA is saying you owe the money as ### guardian, you can argue the overpayment wasnâ€™t your fault if you were not receiving ### benefits at the time the overpayment happened. This would work if his mother was his SSI payee at the time. You will still have to show you canâ€™t afford to pay it back. The Waiver form has a section for income and expenses. 43363.9319444444 You can ask SSA on ### behalf to  a Waive the overpayment. If you get a waiver you will not have to repay the overpayment. To get a waiver you have to show that ###) the overpayment was not ### fault and ###) he cannot afford to repay it. If heâ€™s on SSI, Social Security will assume he canâ€™t repay. To show that itâ€™s not his fault, you need to know why SSA said he was overpaid  this should be on a notice that SSA mailed. If you donâ€™t see it, call SSA and ask them.To request a Waiver, use the form at https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-63###.html. I hope this information is helpful. 43363.9270833333 As I suspected  I am afraid they are right then that you will not get benefits while you appeal.This is complicated and you should definitely consider consulting an attorney but generally speaking, you should consider the following:###) Filing an appeal of the original work-related termination of your benefits on the grounds that they were wrong that you made too much for too long, and/or their calculation of the amount of the resulting overpayment was wrong.2)Also filing an appeal of the medical improvement decision on the grounds that even if you may be better than you were when first awarded benefits your impairments are still severe enough to prevent you from working on a sustained full time basis.If you do seek legal counsel you would benefit from someone   experienced in SS related work issues, CDRs, and overpayments who is familiary with this kind of pretty common scenario, and who can eview your situation in detail and who can give you  personalized  advice. If you are financially eligible you can try your local legal services program.  If you want to find a private attorney you might try the the referral service of the National Organization of Social Security Claimants Representatives (NOSSCR) at ###Good luck,### ###43341.70625 First question I have was why  the medical review was done.  Was it:###) part of a standard DDS periodic Continuing Disabiity Review (CDR) or###) because you had gone off disability after going back to work, and then stopped working within ###, and DDS was reviewing your claim to confirm your continuing disabllity to make your reinstaement permanent.If it was ###) and your benefits are terminated due to medical improvement you definitely  are entitled to interim benefits while you appeal the termination, at least through the ALJ level.But if it was ###) no interim benefits are available.I am also unclear on whether your benefits have actually been terminated yet.  You said you received a letter from DDS, but usually the actual termination letter is from the SSA.  What exactly did the SSA claims rep you spoke to say about the status of your claim, whether your benefits had been terminated and your appeal rights?### ###43341.5375 Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission sent me a letter stating my health has improved and I am no longer disabled. The letter states that I an appeal this decision within ###, and I can keep getting benefits while appeal is ongoing if I file within ###. I went to the Social Security Office and they said I was mailed the wrong letter  and I cannot keep getting benefits while on appeal. Is this correct?43341.2861111111 the letter had the social security heading on it, but the envelope it came in had Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission, Disability Determination Services on the return address. The SSA claim rep said I was terminated and need to appeal. My situation is basically the ###. I was working and collecting disability and was cut off for going over the SGA...then put on expedited reinstatement for ### payments. DDS reviewed my claim and said my health had improved.43341.6944444444 I was receiving SNAP benefits and when my wife went to work part time: the benefits were stopped.I am disabled and we have two minor children in our home. 43348.3854166667 Both ny daughter and I are disabled, her medical expenses are more than I can afford. I was told on ### that our SNAP benefits are being reduce to $###'t show that I spend enough. Previously I brought receipts that cover many months, what I gave at the renewal was the receipts since than, which of course is less, it was for less months. I was told I had to apply for a appeal. The food we both need for health reasons I won't be able to buy. I am ### 21. 43348.4993055556 Thank you very much.  I have asked the same of a non-SSA practicing attorney (a colleague of my spouse) informally and her response was nearly identical.  I appreciate your response and also appreciate the assistance you provide to the under- and unrepresented.43356.775 The contracted attorney (SSA max $6k fee as contingency for taking my case) sent notice to SSA and myself stating she would not be representing me with my claim approximately three weeks before a scheduled 19 ###.  Any advice on how to proceed would be appreciated.Thanks,-CMA43356.2236111111 There is a new rule governing when how close to hearing any attorney may withdraw from representation except in extraordinary circumstances."  Having said that I think the lawyer's withdrawal from a contingent fee case at the last minute is a pretty good sign that they ###t think the claim.is likely to be approved at hearing. I think you should call the Judge's assistant say that you are looking for a new laywer and need to have the case continued to find one.Worst case the assistant will tell you the judge wants you to come to the hearing and make the request again there.  My guess is that it will be granted. Also while you are on the phone with the assistant if you ### not already have one get them to send you a CD of the Hearing file.Once you buy yourself some time you need to determine from the prior attorney exactly why they withdrew. If they think the medical evidence was not strong enough to winyou should ask what exactly is missing and what you would need to get to make the case stronger. Also ask them what steps they took while representing you to get stronger evidence. Did they send for records? Talk to your providers? Whether you get helpful info you then have all the background you need to start looking for a new lawyer.  If they are experience their response to your contacting them will be to ask to review the CD which is the only way to determine the strength of your claim as is and what additional information they need from you to decide if they will take your case.  If they turn you down after reviewing the file ask them to be specific about what more would be needed to win your case.  If you cant find an atty to take the case you will have to decide whether to go in unrepresented or if you are convinced that the hearing would be a waste of time you might decide to give up on trying to get the back benefits that would have been awarded and withdraw your appeal.You can then file a new claim in the future with better evidence. KEEP IN MIND that if your claim is for SSDI you will only be able to file a new claim if your "insured status" extends beyond the date of the reconsideration decision.

But if you did not become disabled till after ###.But even if you can't use an Able Account, if whoever is giving you the downpayment does not give it to you until the month you would give it to the seller, then it would only disqualify you from SSI for the month you received it. It would be gone by the next month since you will have given it to the seller.

Assuming you were to put down $50,### $###,### $###, not including utilities, repaires, upkeep, insurance, taxes etc.Once the lender did the math I think they would conclude that you would be unlikely to be able to afford to keep up payments.

I was told my sons benifits will stop if I don't add her is this true?43416.6090277778 I applied for the Lump Sum Benefit and was denied because his death certificate says married but separated". We were only physically separated because he was receiving hospice in NH and I had to work in MA. He would come home when he was feeling well enough. We were legally married.My in-laws filled out the information with the funeral home and town hall. I suspect that they were angry with me because they were giving him more aid than me because they live in NH and their work schedules allowed the time. My husband and I decided that he receiving hospice in NH was what he preferred and was best for our family. The person at the town hall who issued the death certificate informed me that his sister originally wanted to write "divorced". Neither the funeral home or town hall could assist me in correcting the death certificate.The best information I have to prove that we were legally married and shared the same address was the confirmation of his Application Summary for Disability Insurance Benefits with Social Security. When he completed it he gave his address as the same as mine. He also stated that he was married to me. This was completed a little more than ###. We were living together at that time. It was only when he was really sick and started more treatments that he went to NH.Is this enough evidence? Is it worth my time fighting it?

I have an appeal hearing but I don't really know how to fight this decision because they have given me no specific information as to what about my "student status" makes me ineligible. I am only able to work on the weekends and I cannot work every weekend and so I am pulling in less than $###. I can't totally wrap my head around why I am not eligible. Just to reiterate I have spoken to multiple representatives at the DTA office and at my school who stated that my full-time school status should not be an issue. I am receiving my MSW at ###. (Ironic huh-- currently writing you this from my internship where I am helping students get DTA assistance...)Hoping you can help me! Thank you in advance.My date is today but I assume you won't respond today. Even if I get denied I really still would like to know how I can fight this when I re-apply and also how to help my clients when we will inevitably face this in the future. So appreciate the ### you do!"43424.6486111111 Hi, Ms. ###,Your situation occurs every so often.  More often there are cases where an adult child of a beneficiary is trying to collect child's benefits on their father's account but the father's name was not on their birth certicate.In either case, even if the best evidence" is not available you are entitled to submit the secondary evidence you suggested and affidavits fom people with direct ### of your relationship. (anyone around who attended the wedding?)But dont expect the local office to seriously consider what you submit.  If they havent done so already make them issue a formal denial so you can file for reconsideration and then if denied again request for a hearing before an administrative law judge.  At the hearing the ALJ will review all of the documentary evidence you submit and take testimony from you and anyone else you bring along.  Let me know if you have any other questions.Good luck.### ###"43433.63125 My estranged husband of over ### 2015. I left him in ###. Social security informed me of his death in ###. They informed me I needed my marriage certificate from ###. My original copy was lost in Hurricane ### from when I was living in New Orleans and, to make matters worse, I was informed by Boston City Hall and the Registry that no certificate could be found. Various agents in the Boston Social Security office have given ### requests for supporting documentation. This has included copies of tax records from the ###, which are impossible to obtain since IRS records only go back ###, or copies of family health insurance records from the same period. These are also no longer available because they were before computers" as the insurance companies have told me. I have an enormous amount of secondary documentation including my daughter's birth certificate showing both my maiden and married names along with my husband's name a U.S. passport under my married name an Irish passport under my married name since I have dual citizenship a social security card under my married name and a letter from the SSA listing every name I have ever worked under which also includes both my maiden and married names. The point being I filed taxes as part of a married couple was reissued a new social security card under my married name had a child under my married name and shared a bank account under my married name but this all happened before the ###. So it appears that according to the social security agents I have spoken with I was never married.  Is there a law stating that spousal benefits can be ### denied due to a lost marriage certificate and lack of 30-year old tax records? Because of my very limited income I am hesitant to hire a lawyer if the law is very strict on this and if social security is indeed allowed to deny benefits based on not getting their exact documentation demands."43433.1111111111 I am ###. I recently discovered that there was unclaimed property under my maiden name in my birth state of ### (most likely from my parents). I have no idea what this property is as I have had no contact with my parents since I became of legal age. I was thinking of claiming the ### property, but I am worried about the effects this might have on my supplemental income. It appears that I cannot find out what the property is without claiming it. What are the laws regarding inherited property (either cash or other property) and SSI and ###? My retirement benefit without the ### is under $###. Do I stand to lose this income based on some level of inheritance? If I do lose the income, would I have to re-apply for benefits if the property turned out to be very little?43433.7145833333 Unfortunately, the asset limit for SSI is $2000 -- a figure that hasn't been raised in decades.  (And eligibility for ### is tied to SSI.)   There is a substantial chance that the property in question would disqualify you temporarily, until spent down.  The process of suspending SSI gives you advance notice and a chance to preserve benefits pending appeal, so it might result in an overpayment that you could pay off ###.   Without some idea of the scale of magnitude of this unclaimed property, it is difficult to advise whether it's worth your while to claim it. 43434.8972222222 ### situation is that I got my friends wife pregnant. He was at the hospital when the baby was born so they put his name on the birth certificate. I went to court and took a dna test for the judge so she could rule properly. The dna test says it is ###. We filled out a birth certificate change form at the courthouse so my name will be put on the birth certificate showing that I am the biological father. The mother has him for a week then I get him for a week and so on. The problem is that I will not get the updated birth certificate for three to six months and I could really use the money benefit that he is due right now so I can care for him more properly. I get SSDI for a ### brain injury, anxiety, depression and PTSD. My question is do you think I can show the Social Security Administration any other documents besides his birth ### to show them that I am the biological father? Some examples i can think of is the DNA lab paperwork that states that I am the biological father. I also have the courthouse issued paperwork that states that I get to take care of him every other week. Are there any other forms that I can show besides the birth certificate? Thank you for your assistance as I really appreciate it!43434.0645833333 Hi, ###, If you have not done so already, you should go to the SS office and apply for benefits for your son.   You should not have to wait for the birth certificate to be finalized.  The SS will tell you what will satisfy them.  The paternity test, a statement from the mother, the court order (if there is one ) and the fact that a new birth certificate has already been applied for should be enough.Good luck.### ###43434.0868055556 I am trying to file a second appeal on an overpayment that was done for my daughter's SSI. I was denied the first appeal but I know I need a lawyer moving forward. I originally sent in my income information to the ### SSA but they never changed it. I then called the customer service and they sent them an email to call me and letting them know I was working. No one called me at all. I sent in the paystubs again but received nothing. I finally sent a letter to the people that send the questionnaire to the ### and they forwarded the papers to ###. Finally was in touch with a supervisor and she asked me for all my paystubs and child support papers. Which I provided. She sent me an amount that was owed and I appealed it but was denied. At the time of the appeal I was told I never reported my son's child support. Which is not accurate because I always send in the printout that DOR sends me with both my kids' child support amounts. When I first started receiving Child support for my youngest the worker from SSA told me that they didn't count my little ones and she highlighted the printouts. They had that in my file. I cannot afford to pay this amount back.43451.6944444444 You  say you have appealed once, I take it that you filed what is called a â€œRequest for Reconsiderationâ€ and that was denied.  The next step in appealing is to request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) .  You must file that request within ###.  It may be possible to get help with that from your local legal aid program.  Depending on where you live in ### County, that is either:South Coastal Counties Legal Services###, MA ###### ###-###Serving: Barnstable, Bristol, ###, TERM###0175, and Nantucket County, and select towns in ### County. or  MetroWest Legal Services*###, Suite ###, MA 017### ###-###Serving: Southern ### and Northern ### Counties This would be an appeal claiming that your daughter was NOT actually overpaid.  From your question, it may be that what has happened is that your daughter was actually overpaid, but that the overpayment was the result of an error by the Social Security Administration (SSA).   If that is the case, there is no point in further appeal of the overpayment itself.  Instead, what you should do is to request a waiver of the overpayment.  Under the Social Security Act, you are entitled to have an overpayment waived (i.e. forgiven) if you meet both of two conditions.  The first is that the overpayment was not your fault.  If you can show that you provided accurate information and SSA did not act on it timely and correctly, you would meet this condition.  The second is that your daughter cannot afford to pay it back. Since she is on SSI, she should automatically be presumed not to be able to repay the money. There is no time limit to request waiver of an overpayment.  The form for the request can be found at ###   If the waiver request is denied, you can appeal (request reconsideration) and if that is denied you can request an ALJ hearing on the waiver.  The process is described at ###43457.64375 Hi, Mr. ###,If you received the $$ from the MTRB in January and didnt spend it down till ### that you do owe back the SSI for the months your combined resources were over $### until you spent it down. I think your focus at this point should be in documenting that the money has been spent and that you are again eligible going forward.  Have you sent the SSA copies of your bank statements and receipts showing that the money was spent and not just transferred or gifted to others?Assuming you have done so you should keep bugging the local office until your benefits are reinstated. With regard to the ###, you will have the right to file an appeal of the amount assessed and then a request for a waiver of any overpayment actually found to ### been made.With regard to getting benefits reinstated through the courts before they have adjudicated your reinstatement request, and or your appeal of the overpayment is unlikely to succeed.  I do not believe the court would have the right to hear any claim by interim benefits other than in an appeal of the final decision by the ssa after all internal appeals have been exhausted.Let me know if you have any other questions.Good luck### ###43468.74375 I have submitted a ~###.43464.9993055556 Dear Mr. ###:            Here are three possible ways to obtain an attorney who can represent you at the hearing:Use the following website and its list of lawyer referral services:  ###.

You provided only the first page of Social Securityâ€™s ###, letter, and as you point out, that one page states that it has found that â€œyour disability is continuing.â€             That same page of the letter also states that â€œyour claim will be reviewed from time to time to see if you are still eligible for benefits based on disability,â€ and that â€œyou will be contacted if there is any question as to whether your eligibility continues.â€      All of that also sounds as if your benefits are continuing.             As a result, the first order of business for you should be to find out whether it still is the position of Social Security that you should no longer get benefits.  The answer to that may determine whether a hearing still will be necessary on ### and whether you will need a lawyer to assist.

The officer only focused on one - that I was unaware that there was a policy for replacement benefits- & ignored the others.  It is true I was unaware that this benefit existed initially as it is not well communicated by DTA, but there were more critical factors that took precedent such as my medical issues & refrigerated medication lost without the ability to replace it because ### revamped the plans ### which caused a mountain of transition issues for my care  In my letter I included a detailed explanation & timeline, along with other documentation in addition to the original ### form & Service Order from the repairman.At hearing I got the sense that the officer did not care, & feel he didn't fairly consider my case as I had his denial decision in a week.

But I perhaps can help you understand the process a little better by referring you to the information about appeals on this Social Security Administration internet link:  ###            As you can see from reviewing the information available through the above internet link, there generally are four levels of appeal.  The documents that should have been provided to your son by the Social Security Administration will provide other appropriate information that might be useful.            Your son may wish to seek the assistance of an attorney, and he may want to ask to postpone the upcoming hearing until he can obtain one.  Further, a relative lack of financial resources does not automatically mean that your son cannot obtain a lawyerâ€™s help.            Two ways of obtaining a lawyer, if one is not already available to you, are as follows.            First, you or your son could use the following website and its list of lawyer referral services:  ###.

Unfortunately thatâ€™s not a service we can provide through this web forum, but I can point you in three different directions that should be helpful!First, you might try contacting Greater Boston Legal Services. They do offer assistance with some Social Security ### if youâ€™re in the western part of the state, they might be able to direct you to a similar organization thatâ€™s closer to you. (Your question indicates youâ€™re in ### County.)###Second, you can contact a lawyer referral service. The Massachusetts Bar Association has one, and most county bar associations have them, ### ### County. Itâ€™s usually a hotline where you tell someone where youâ€™re located and a little about the problem you need help with (in your case, applying for Social Security disability benefits), and they will give you contact information for a lawyer who handles that type of work and whoâ€™s local to you. Usually those lawyers agree to give a free or low-cost initial consultation, so you can decide if he or she is a good match for you. If the person doesnâ€™t seem right for you, then just call back the referral ### try a different ### get another referral!###https://www.###barassn.org/lawyer-referral-service/[Just a note here: I live in ### County and Iâ€™m a member of both those bar associations, but I donâ€™t participate in their referral services and I donâ€™t practice Social Security law. But there are plenty of other referral services out there, too!]Third, if you feel comfortable using Google, you can poke around for some lawyers and law firms in your area to see who handles this kind of work. This shouldnâ€™t cost you anything up-front. For most lawyers Iâ€™m familiar with who do this type of work, they take their pay from a lump sum youâ€™ll eventually receive if your claim is successful. You donâ€™t have to work with someone who gets paid that way, of ### the advantage is that you donâ€™t have to pay anything up front. For most people applying for benefits, that makes sense.I hope that gives you a few useful starting points, ###. This is definitely something you should be able to get help with.

I would like to know if I am able to take this to court and be reimbursed for the money that was lost.43537.6201388889 Hi there, ###. Thanks for your question.The short answer is yes, it sounds like you have some options.If Iâ€™m understanding your question correctly: ### claimed that youâ€™d done something to her, and based on that claim she got a restraining order and you were charged with several crimes. You have been acquitted of those charges, and now the restraining order is set to expire in a ### like most restraining orders, when this one expires, ### can ask for it to be renewed.You have two options for ending the restraining order. First, you can wait a month and appear at that already-scheduled hearing. Make sure you bring a certified copy of the verdict in your criminal case, so you can give it to the judge. If ### doesnâ€™t show up, then the restraining order will be dismissed automatically. If she does show up, then the judge will conduct a hearing to decide whether the order should be extended. Youâ€™ll have a chance to speak and to present ### like you did at the first hearing, ### thatâ€™s where youâ€™ll explain to the judge that her accusations were false, that you were acquitted on all charges, and that the order should be dropped and you should be allowed to live your life without restraint by the court.Your second option is to walk into court right now, instead of waiting a month for the renewal hearing, and ### your ### a hearing to have the order discontinued. A restraining order can be amended or revoked at any time, if the judge finds there has been some material change in circumstances. For instance, imagine that two months after the order had been entered, ###â€™s friend had called you and said, â€œI have an email from ### where she admits that she lied in court to get that restraining order against you.â€ You wouldnâ€™t need to wait the full year to present that to the court. You could request a hearing immediately. I think an acquittal on related charges is a material change in circumstance that deserves revisiting the ### issue.But keep in ### because I think that (and you think that, too!) doesnâ€™t mean a judge will agree.I have to warn you, though. Just because you were acquitted, that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the restraining order should be dropped. In legal terms, when a court makes a decision about something, we ask, â€œWhatâ€™s the standard of proof?â€ Thatâ€™s a way of asking, â€œWhat needs to be proved, for this thing to happen?â€ The standard of proof in your criminal case is different from the standard of proof for a restraining order.In your criminal case, the Commonwealth needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you had committed those crimes.In her ### case, ### needs to prove by a preponderance of evidence that she has an objectively reasonable fear of imminent harm from you.Those are very different things. In my opinion, youâ€™ll win points with the judge if you explain that you understand this. In my opinion, youâ€™ll lose points if you appear not to understand it. (But I canâ€™t predict how a random judge might react.)One last point. If you want to, youâ€™re entitled to ask the judge to make written findings supporting his or her decision. Judges hate doing this, because theyâ€™re overworked already, so often this is a way to lose ### theyâ€™ve been told by the higher courts that they should be doing it, and if you want to appeal the judgeâ€™s decision it will be important to have written findings so you know what youâ€™re appealing. So decide for yourself whether this is something you want to request, depending how the hearing seems like itâ€™s going.I hope thatâ€™s helpful, ###.

Instead, he could state that he has authorized you to use his address for the purpose of receiving mail during your temporary homelessness.

Entrapment" Ring a ###"43554.5465277778 Hello, I am a retired legal services lawyer who has volunteered to respond to some of the questions on Mass. Legal Answers On-Line (MLAO").  Although I had only one Social Security appeal during my career (in Bristol County) I believe that I can respond helpfully to your basic question.As I understand it applications for SSI & SSDI can go through a three-step process potentially involving two appeals to the Social Security Administration.  At South Coastal Counties Legal Services (which did some of these appeals) up to ###0###4 (when I retired there) the attorney who usually did these appeals considered only the final appeal for her representation.  I do not know that you would need an attorney for the first appeal; but you have the right to retain an attorney to assist you.  There are some fine attorneys in Bristol County as well as ### who take these cases; and I believe that they mostly agree to be reimbursed for their time and their fee through the lump-sum payment that the applicant would receive if the appeal is successful and results in an award or SSI and/or SSDI.  (The "lump-sum award" is based on the accumulation of the SSI and/or SSDI benefits from the date of application to the date of the first payment.) (### provides free legal assistance to clients with very low incomes; but they cannot accept every legitimate case because of limited funding.)The three stages of a ### ### case I summarize as follows:  {###} Application with your doctors' documentation - first denial - first appeal - {###} more doctors' documentation often involving the SSA's doctors and their opinions - second denial - second appeal - {###} administrative hearing [like a trial before an Administrative Judge] - final decision [by the Judge].  In most cases an experienced attorney can help most for the administrative hearing/trial.  I would recommend applying to qualified lawyers for assistance and representation as soon as possible if and when you receive the denial because the attorney might find that further medical or other evidence is needed for your case.  Please be aware that not every medical condition would qualify an applicant for disability assistance and most attorneys would assess your case before offering to represent you.  It also is possible that legal assistance might be helpful to you at the second stage; but being less experienced and without knowledge of your facts I will not offer an opinion about that for your case.  Good luck.     "43620.8256944444 Hi I applied for ssdi & ssi back in ###, and it tells me I was denied for both.I want to appeal the decision, but not sure if I should obtain an Attorney first?43594.8986111111 Thank You very much for your help Mr. ###. 43630.5916666667 My monthly SNAP benefits were reduced.  However, I challenged this because my income has raised but not significantly, I am paying more for health insurance (which isn't calculated in the formula for benefits), but the main issue was my transportation expense has increased dramatically and they aren't using it in their calculation.My mother (elderly and largely immobile) transports my daughter home from school while I'm at work.  Because of her ### issues, she cannot take public transport leaving Uber/Lyft as we have no car.  The DTA originally told me that they cannot consider that within their calculation, however, after speaking with several representatives, I was told that it is indeed valid, but I would need to file a hearing.   I requested a hearing and the results of that hearing were a denial.  On the denial notice, it said that I've given no proof of my transportation situation.  I was unaware that I had to do so before the hearing (as it wasn't indicated on the original hearing notice).  DTA has informed me that they cannot accept proofs ### and that I would need to file a case in ### Superior court. I would like to know what, if any recourse I can take and if I do, indeed, need to file with the superior court, what I need to do for that.43598.6090277778 Dear Ms. ###,DTA is required to issue the back money no later than ###.  DTA management staff has said ### that it will start issuing the back money next week or late this week for children who have been added to the grant because of the end of the family cap rule. DTA has not made an official announcement yet so it is not your worker's fault that he didn't know the timing of the back payments.  If you were receiving ### ### you should get money back to ###.If you have any questions, you may contact me directly at ###### ###Mass. Law Reform Institute43607.8131944444 I was just wondering if you knew when mother's will receive there retro pay from the cap on babies I asked my worker he doesn't know43607.7875 Hi, ###,First of all worst case, you will get the waiver approved since you were obviously not at fault in causing the overpayment which apparently occured because of some factor involving your father, or another of his current dependents, and nothing you could have known about. But this will not change the fact that going forward they are going to be paying you less per month.Before you file a waiver I think you should first file a request for reconsideration of the overpayment so you can a detailed explanation of why they are retroactively reducing your benefits and an opportunity to review with the file and then submit an argument if you think they are wrong for reducing your benefits at all. Then the SSA will have to make a decision on your appeal and at that point if they sustain the ### and you dont thin an appeal makes sense, then you can file the waiver request and get at least the overpayment waived.  This strategy also prevents the SSA from reducing your benefits to recoup the overpayment until you have exhausted your appeal and waiver request rights.You do not need a lawyer to file the appeal, you can do it online (look for filing a nonmedical appeal" at ssa.gov) or by going into your local SS office.  But obviously this is complicated so if possible see if you can get someone from your local legal services program to advise you.Good luck### ###"43613.5972222222 I received a letter stating I owe $### benefits I receive because they started paying another person on this record.

If she does reapply I dont think it makes sense involving a lawyer until the Field office agrees she meets the financial criteria and her file is sent for a medical review on the issue of disability.  If her claim is denied at that point you can seek assistance from your local legal services office or perhaps contact ###, a national ### of SS attorneys that has a referral service.

Thanks for posting. Iâ€™m very sorry to hear about your lost ring.Iâ€™ll try to answer your questions ###:(###) Itâ€™s difficult to answer whether â€œ### keepersâ€ is law. The answer depends on the ### is often true of legal questions. If you find a $###, and you donâ€™t have any reason to believe it hasnâ€™t been abandoned, then you should be able to take that money to the store and buy a soda without worrying that youâ€™ll be charged as an ### if it was stolen in a bank robbery. On the other hand, if you witness a bank robbery and notice that the robbers let a $###, and if you take that money and use it to buy a soda, then you are probably guilty of a crime.So the answer in your question would depend on who found the ring, and in what circumstances. Obviously the appropriate thing would be to bring the ring to a ###, or to contact the police, or to post on social media to find its owner. But just because the person who found the ring did something that was ### taking the ring, or like throwing the ring into a trash ### necessarily mean what that person did was illegal.(###) You have already filed a police report, so Iâ€™m not sure whether youâ€™re asking about an insurance claim. But to answer your question: the ring was lost. It may also have been stolen, but you donâ€™t know whether that happened or whether something else happened. Maybe someone found it and thought it belonged to them. Maybe someone found it and thought it was a toy and threw it in the trash. Maybe someone found it and put it into their purse intending to bring it to the police, and just hasnâ€™t gotten around to doing it yet. You donâ€™t ### because you canâ€™t articulate a basis to believe it was stolen, you risk hurting your own rights if you claim that it was.(###) I donâ€™t really follow what youâ€™re asking here. I canâ€™t answer why the police werenâ€™t as helpful as they might have been. Maybe you spoke to an officer who was having a bad day, or maybe he thought you were being rude somehow, or maybe he was just busy and didnâ€™t pay as much attention to your issue as he should have. I wasnâ€™t there, so I donâ€™t have a basis for guessing what might have happened.(###) You can post on social media. You can let the office manager ### the property manager, or whoever is the relevant person or entity for that restroom. You can keep contacting or visiting pawn shops. You can post flyers. You can offer a reward. But in terms of a legal solution, I donâ€™t see an easy one. The law is mostly designed to resolve disputes between people. If you donâ€™t know who the other person is, then itâ€™s hard to resolve the dispute.I hope thatâ€™s helpful, at least as much as it can be. Good luck, ###. I hope youâ€™re able to find your ring. 43648.8138888889 I recently left my engagement ring on the countertop in the office building restroom after washing my hands, checked back after half hour, nothing's there anymore. It is an expense and has sentimental value to me, I posted $###,###. Everyone knows someone took it (which is obvious), and decided no returning it since she might be arrested if the owner decides to turn her into police after the ring is returned.  I filed a police report, and the police were rude when talking to them through phone. They asked me to ### to pawn stores (tons of them in MA) myself and they refused to file a police report for me, counting it as a regular lost case. My questions is:Is finder keep legal? What if it is a ### property? and I just left it for half hour?under this scenario, do I have the right to raise the report as stolen?why police ppl refused to help even though it's much easier for them by checking the transaction records that pawn shops sent to them, but for me, I will have to contact tons of them one by one, and since I don't have the police report, they will less willing to help me out.what else I can do to get my ring back, please help!Thanks,###43648.7972222222 Hi there, ###. Let me begin by saying that I'm sorry to hear about your situation.It looks like you had a conversation earlier with another of our volunteer lawyers. I can see your replies to that conversation, but I'm not able to view the volunteer lawyer's posts so I don't have a full context to understand what happened. I do understand you weren't satisfied with whatever information was provided. That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry to hear it. I can tell you that we volunteer our time ### on nights and weekends, as you can ### we genuinely want to help people. We don't want anyone leaving unsatisfied. We know that's a reality that will happen sometimes, but we try to avoid it.This site is designed for answering legal questions (Free Legal Answers") not providing extended legal representation. To my reading of your situation you need something more extended. For instance on this site I'm not allowed to contact DTA on your behalf. If you walked into my office in person at a ### organization then I could pick up the phone and call DTA (or write a letter etc). It's a different form of aid. We are very restricted on this website in what we're allowed to do. For some people it's very helpful. I can answer questions about divorce explain the process for sealing criminal records and strategize about how to deal with problematic landlords. Unfortunately I don't think this is the type of help you're looking for or need.I'll suggest a few resources that might be a better fit for you:MetroWest Legal Services and Community Legal Aid are two ### organizations in your area that might be worth speaking to. They might be able to help you directly or they might be able to refer you to a lawyer who can help or they might be able to refer you to someplace that can help.###/###/The ### courthouse has a court service center that's staffed with some incredibly warm and dedicated people who try to help with a variety of problems. If they can't help you directly then I think they might be an excellent resource for helping to point you in a better direction. Again I'm sure it's frustrating to be referred from one place to another to ### the reality is that our society doesn't have enough free legal aid to help everybody who needs it and if there is a fit sometimes it takes some elbow grease to find it. Since you come from the health care field I'm sure you can relate to this problem.https://www.mass.gov/locations/###-court-service-centerFinally you might try reaching out to your state (or even federal) representatives. A good ### office will have a good ### staff that's accustomed to helping people communicate better with state agencies and to resolve problems very much like what you're describing. (As I'm sure you already know the situation you're describing is incredibly frustrating but also not uncommon.) In the best-case scenario your representative might be able to solve your problem with a telephone call. In the worst-case scenario maybe they won't be able to help ### refer you to someplace that might.###I hope these resources give you some new options ###. Your last post said you had no further questions so I'll go ahead and close this thread but I wanted to make sure someone had reached out to you and tried to offer some additional support before closing. I understand this site wasn't a great fit for what you needed in this situation and that's ### but I do understand why. We're all volunteers here and we are doing our best.Good luck ###."43659.7604166667 I have an open case with ### DTA, it was started in ######. Iâ€™m receiving insurance, and food stamps.

I usually fax in my signed papers and info they requested. Do I have the right to have a phone appointment?43699.0930555556 Hi, last week I applied for SNAP benefits at DTA online. At the end of last week I received a call from a case worker from DTA. I answered all his questions truthfully of course. I have not had any income since 2015. I have been struggling to find employment without success - I am ###. I have been supported all this time by my mother's meager income and trying hard to stay off any state assistance. I sent DTA a copy of my last rent receipt and a statement that I am unemployed without income. Despite my repeated objections the case worker claimed that the support I received from my mother - she had no legal obligation to support me - should be declared as income. He asked me to provide DTA with a signed statement that I do have income" which would be the sum of my rent plus the phone bills. If I did that he would provide me with an unspecified emergency food support assistance for a month but I would not get any more assistance afterwards since "I do have income". I did some research afterwards and found out that according to DTA regulations the support I have been receiving from my mother is not considered income. Naturally I did not send the requested statement. The DTA regulations state that if an applicant covers his living expenses partly(??) by support he receives from a person (my mother) that is not legally obliged to do so the applicant does not declare it as income. The rent and phone bills are under my name; my mother lives in another city. Can you please provide me with some advice on how to address this problem with the DTA? I intend to receive the benefits I am entitled to to their fullest. Can you please also inform me whether I am entitled to any other financial benefits? I am single no children no disability no veteran. Thank you."43699.7291666667 Hello Ms. ###,You usually have ###.  In most situations, DTA must give you at least ###.

DTA can recover benefits you got while you were waiting for a hearing if you lose. ###.### Â§ ###.It is almost always a good idea to appeal any denial, termination, or reduction in benefits promptly.

Despite the likely financial need a person and their family has when they apply for disability, it is a very slow and inefficient process.While you should remain hopeful, please keep in  mind that statistically most people who apply for benefits are denied, then file their first appeal, are denied again, and then have to file a request for hearing and wait up to a year for a hearing before an administrative law judge.The fact that the SSA is sending your husband to an exam usually means that they did not find the medical evidence they gathered from his medical providers convincing.  You may want to talk to the DDS rep to find out what they got from his providers and why that was not enough to warrant a decision without an exam.

Best regards, ###43719.7881944444 Hello ###, Thank you very much for your quick reply. I went back carefully through my DTA letters and saw that in fact for all of the years that a detailed calculation was included,a 30% income deduction had been applied. However, for more than half of the years since 2008, no detailed computation was supplied, as you mention, which had led me to think that it was being applied inconsistently. This year my benefit has been reduced by roughly 25% from ###, when I supplied the same income data. On careful consideration, I now think that was due to a change in my medical expenses, which fell below the $###. Since no full computation was supplied for my interim, I can't make an exact comparison.Sincerely yours, ###43719.7680555556 Hello ###,I am glad that you appeared to have identified the cause of the benefit reduction.

Whoever gave you that ### should be reported to their supervisor.In any case the way SSI works where someone has a relatively low SSDI benefit is to pay an amount to bring your SSDI rate up to a federal minimum which is about $### (assuming they are living in their own place with out any financial assistance for food and shelter.)If you were getting a $### $###. yes? If so, then all that is at issue is your ### to the $###.

How much is your SSDI currently?Your SSDI rate is based on your past earnings and is not affected by anything but earned income or Workers' Compensation.  So it makes no sense that your SSDI would change due to your financial needs and you would be ineligible for any SSI supplement if your SSDI benefits were already over $######  month.So what is your SSDI rate?   ALso were you also getting a state SSI supplement?"43732.5854166667 I lost my benefits in ### due to receiving insurance money when my mother died ###19. I'm out of money and need to get back on SSI, but when they'll ask to see ### i spent the money on, I can only justify a few months. During the months of late July, August & September, I was so grief filled, depressed, anxious, and started experiencing memory ### type states, where I don't remember days, weeks, or what i did or how i did it. I spent money on material things and essentially wasted thousands of dollars, but by the time I realized what happened, it was too late to ### most of the items. What type of documentation or support do I need from my ### to support this claim, and what protections under the law will help me to prove that I do need emergency financial help (will be homeless in a few months if not).

I'm afraid SSA will see that I wasted" my money deny me and I will have no way to pay my rent/utilities while i'm still out of work on SSDI. I've never done anything like this before nor experienced any memory issues until of late. How to I best represent my case and put up a worthy fight?"43732.4222222222 Okay. Thank you for that.

I do receive SSDI - $###/month (based on my past income). I was receiving $###, but that was stopped once I reported the insurance money from my mother in ###. The woman calculating everything into the computer said that had I not received the 100K, after moving to a new apartment and having higher rent, utilities, etc., that my SSI would have been $### (thirteen something, i recall) to offset how little i receive in actual disability. So, I am currently still receiving SSDI ($###), and SNAP benefits, but no SSI. I'm going on Friday to reapply for SSI, to get benefits reinstated ASAP. Thats when the rude lady told me about it being a welfare program, not for blowing money. That's what made me stop and think about the legal loopholes to protect me from getting rejected. I can absolutely prove where every dollar went, as I used it all thru my debit or visa cards, so there's a paper trail. I'm just worried about them judging or rejecting me for the content of what i bought. Like i said, i really have been suffering memory issues so my doctor can absolutely verify that, and if it would help me, I can get a letter from her. I'm sorry if i confused you, let me know if there's anything else you need to know, I'm so very grateful for your expertise.### ### ###43732.7631944444 Sorry to hear about your troubles.  What the SSA needs is proof that you really spent the money rather than just giving it to someone else to hold, giving it away, or keeping it in cash but pretending that it was spent.How much did you receive in ###?I understand why you are uncomfortable having to disclose that you did not handle the money in a more responsible way, but this in ### is not an issue for SS as long as you really spent it.  I have had cases where a person on SSI had received a workers comp settlement of $50,###.   The client got his benefits restored once the SSA was convinced that the money was spent on ### and gambling at the casino, rather than having been given away or hidden.So I would start by trying to make a list of where the money went and to the extent you can get receipts or statements from individuals who can corroborate the expenses the SSA will reduce the amount you received.  Even if there is some amount that you cannot document all that will mean is that the SSA will divide that amount by your regular monthly SSI rate, and not reinstate you for that many months from the date yo received.For example if you received 30,### $20,###, that leaves $10,###.  The SSA will take the $10,### $### (your actual rate might be different)  and not reinstate your benefit until that many months after ### when you received the Good luck. ### ###.43732.5569444444 Thank you so much for your response. I really truly appreciate it.To clarify a bit more:I received the insurance money of 100k in ###19. My ### said not to bother to report it to SSA because it wasn't taxable income. But, i soon found out, they DID need to know, so I met with them in ### (after paying off debts, I was already down to ### in ### when i met with SSA). I was receiving only $###, due to the fact that my expenses then were much lower as my mother and I lived together and she was paying for ###% of my bills, since my actual SSDI is only $### (i used to work as an esthetician, so i didn't report my most of my tips, and little did i know, ###). So losing it was not a blow financially, as the $###. But they informed me then that IF i hadn't received the life insurance money, SSI would have increased my monthly benefits to $###+ at least, as I don't make enough to cover things, and to come back when my insurance money ran out.The woman I spoke with at SSA yesterday said i have to prove that i spent the money on legitimate needs" because "SSI is a welfare program not meant to pay for people to blow their money". Yes that's a quote. So that scared me because of the ### reasons i stated earlier. So i guess I'm just wondering given what you said about them not caring about the expenses as much as where they went (which in my case 100% was all spent legally I've nothing to hide in that sense) should I be okay with just giving them ### ### of checks (all up front and ###) or should I also get some sort of report or letter from a medical professional (both my psychiatrist and therapist are aware of my situation and have been all along) to try and make a case for essentially making ### bad decisions due to tremendous mental duress? I just want to cover all my bases because I'm not really familiar with the system and what can help or hurt me.So essentially: I received 100k in ###19 and have 6k remaining as of today and I can absolutely verify all of what I used the money for except for anything i paid with cash but that wasn't often. I have all the transactions checks and statements prepared to show them I'm just trying to figure out the medical aspect of it and if it would be pertinent to include something to verify that I'm not making this all up. Thank you again for your valuable time and advice ### ### ###"43732.575 You said: I do receive SSDI - $###/month (based on my past income).

They start with the full Federal SSI amount for your living arrangement which is never more than about $800. Then that is reduced by your other income which in your case is your SSDI check of $###, so my guess is that your SSI rate, once you requalify will be about $300.  in any case, as I said previously in order to requalify you once you spend down below $2,000, youwill need to document to the SSA's ### how you spent the money.  They want proof it was spent, not why or why you don't have good records.  If you dont have receipts you will have to create a statement from memory, as best as you can.  Whatever remains undocumented divided by your SSI rate will be how long you will have to wait before your SSI is reinstated.

However, you may run into problems with the ### child support requirement.  Among other things, you have to cooperate with getting child support from the other parent.  Usually, you don't actually have to do anything about getting support from the other parent until after you are approved for benefits.  If you refuse to cooperate, the ### grant for you and the child will be reduced.  In your case, if the other parent is caring for the child a substantial amount of time, a support order should take into account his contribution.

The Bureau of Special Investigations has set up an interview for civil recovery disposition. This overpayment took place three years ago for a totally time period of seven years as state aid was received. According to the letter I could be charged for criminally on the basis of â€œnot including father in income while residing in homeâ€. Would statue of limitations be held in the case where initial findings where three years ago? 43781.8916666667 Hi,I don't think you need to worry about criminal or civil fraud charges if there is nothing more going on that makes you think that the SSA  wants more than trying to recoup the overpayment made to you.When a person files for a waiver and receives a denial the next step is to schedule a personal conference to take another look.  Without seeing the notice of the conference I cant say for sure, but the conference you have scheduled sounds like it is a standard overpayment personal conference". You really do not need the conference at all unless you do want to appeal the waiver denial.  Assuming you did not report the earnings you received when you first went back to work and you kept the checks after you did so you were probably "at fault" in the overpayment and there would be no point in pursuing the waiver request further.  Your next step should be to let the SSA know that you are not seeking the waiver any more you just want to set a repayment rate for paying the SSA back at a monthly rate you can afford.At this point are you likely to stay off SSI because of the amount of your earnings? Or have your earnings stopped or are low enough that you should be back on SSI at this point.  Let me know and I can give you more info on getting a very low interest free payment plan.### ###"43788.6590277778 I have a $### ###.After i reported it they still kept paying me although they shouldnt and i used the money.

Please advise !!Regards,### Parks    44440.5194444444 Mr. Parks,If there are no further Medicare ### pending, then you should let your attorney know that, and hopefully all further funds will be released. The bank's hold on the disbursed funds sounds like an ordinary requirement of your bank. It does sound like your attorney tried to assist you in getting those funds through the bank. I hope that issue has been resolved by now. If you believe that your attorney is withholding funds that he should not be withholding, or if you have concerns about his representation of you, you may want to reach out to the NC State Bar for assistance. The NC State Bar has a resource to help people having a dispute with their attorney. I Am Having a Dispute with a Lawyer | North Carolina State Bar (ncbar.gov)The first thing I would recommend doing if you have concerns about your representation is to contact the Attorney-Client Assistance Program. This will allow you to explain your issue to the State Bar and seek their assistance in resolving the issue with your attorney. You can reason out to a public liaison by calling ### or via email by contacting ###, including your name and phone number in the email. You can learn more about that program here: Alternatives to Filing a Grievance | North Carolina State Bar (ncbar.gov). This might be the easiest and quickest way to get your questions answered and get some clarity on whether/why your attorney is withholding funds.If that is ineffective and you believe your lawyer is not complying with his ethical obligations, you can consider filing a grievance against your attorney. I recommend reviewing this page on the NC State Bar website: Filing a Grievance | North Carolina State Bar (ncbar.gov)Hopefully this response has addressed your concerns more directly. 44467.7104166667 Mr. Parks,We are sorry to hear you are dealing with this situation, but hope we can offer some helpful advice.It sounds like you are currently represented. Your attorney has access to more information about your matter than we do, so ultimately his advice may differ. Without seeing a copy of the settlement agreement, we can only give advice based on what you've told us.First, it's not uncommon that your employer never assumed liability - that is a common circumstance in these types of cases. However, they did settle with you, so you are receiving compensation even though they're not admitting fault.Second, you are not wrong to be concerned about your employer not paying under the settlement agreement. If you entered into a settlement agreement, your employer is required to comply with it. If your employer does not comply, then you have the ability to sue your employer for breach of the settlement agreement. Many settlement agreements contain an attorneys' fees provision which would require the employer to pay your legal fees incurred in suing for breach of the settlement agreement.Based on your email, it does sound like your employer is in breach of the settlement agreement because they have not only not paid in a timely manner, but also have said they don't have the money to pay. The latter situation sounds like an anticipatory ###, which is the legal ### for someone saying they are not going to perform in accordance with a contract. In a case of anticipatory ###, you don't need to wait for the other side to miss their deadline to perform; you only need to have evidence that they have indicated they aren't going to. It's certainly possible that the checks were lost in the mail, but if that is the case, your employer should have no problem with ### the checks. You should ask your attorney to demand that your employer ### the checks and/or pay the settlement amount by a certain date; if they do not pay, you should consider suing for breach of the settlement agreement.We hope this is helpful. We are leaving this open for a short time in case you have further questions.44448.6381944444 Thanks, for your efforts and information.Regards;### Parks44476.7944444444 Update, I may have confused you or you misunderstood me.

If you apply for benefits for your son, the date that you turn in the SSI application will be the earliest date that the Social Security Administration may find him disabled. This is by statute. That means that any potential money that your son is entitled to will begin on that date.Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have further questions.### ### SappenfieldAttorney at Law44503.8104166667 My question is, should my sons SSI benefits start when he turned ###?I am on SSAD as of ###.

I suggest that you call or email a law firm that handles workers compensation claims, and ask for a 30-minute consultation on your issue.  Many if not all workers compensation lawyers offer free consultations, and I am sure that a lawyer who regularly deals in such matters can quickly size up whether you have a WC case, and if so, what you can expect in terms of compensation.  There is no harm or risk at all in asking for preliminary guidance. On ###, you can search using the Find a Lawyer" feature and search by NC town or city under the "Workers Compensation" practice area category in addition to googling "workers compensation lawyers" and the name of whatever town or city you want to include in your online search.  You should be able to get a precise reliable answer fairly soon perhaps as early as next week if you begin reaching out now.Blessings to you this fall."44448.8736111111 I donâ€™t have a case, but Iâ€™ve had to pay my expenses out of pocket and have pain and suffering.44448.7263888889 Dear Mr. ###: You could consider having the N.C.

If there are multiple employees affected, an employment attorney may be interested in reviewing your cases.Good luck.  44551.8534722222 I have addressed this discrepancy with the Sheriff's office staff starting in ###19. I did this through email correspondence (have copies). The issue is that ### County policy uses FLSA formula to compensate civilian employees for being in ### status after hours, weekends and holidays. The county policy compensation guidelines are double that of the sheriff's office. The sheriff's office does not have a written policy on this matter. A study was conducted by the sheriff's office planning and management as well as finance administration. They concurred that this is a viable issue but it would have to be approved by the sheriff's legal advisor and then the Sheriff. I have inquired through email and personal conversations with the sheriff's staff. No one will answer my questions, no policies have been implemented and it has been ###. I am not the only civilian employee affected by this issue. Detention staff, Dispatchers, IT Techs and we in the Crime Scene Unit are all compensated differently for being on call back. If the sheriff's office is authorized to set their own policy that is not in compliance with county policy, we should be informed. I worked for city of ### police department prior to joining the sheriff's office. The city has new employees fill out a compensation form indicating what type of compensation we wanted to receive for ### and over-time; pay or comp-time.

OR EVEN LOWERED OTHERWISE?43911.7833333333 Hello Roberto,Thank you for uploading a copy of the letter SSA sent you. To summarize, it appears your trial work period ended in ###20, and that your work activity during that time showed your ability to do substantial work. During SSA's trial work period, a beneficiary receiving Social Security disability benefits may test his or her ability to work and still be considered disabled. SSA does not consider services performed during the trial work period as showing that the disability has ended until services have been performed in at least ### (not necessarily consecutive) in a rolling 60-month period.Your letter states that your trial work period ended ###20... so based on the 60-month period, it started in ###15, correct? So for your information: In 2015, any month in which earnings exceed $###'s trial work period.In 2016, any month in which earnings exceed $###'s trial work period.In 2017, any month in which earnings exceed $###'s trial work period.In 2018, any month in which earnings exceed $###'s trial work period.In 2019, any month in which earnings exceed $###'s trial work period.In 2020, any month in which earnings exceed $###'s trial work period.Review your monthly earnings during your trial work period and see if you can count ### (again, not necessarily consecutive) where you exceeded the earnings to make sure that SSA did not err in their calculations. If you believe SSA erred in deciding that your disability ended because of your substantial work, you have ### (dated ###) to ask for an appeal and present any new facts for them to consider.Also, if you stopped working or your work was not substantial in any months before ###20, and your health problems still meet their rules, the letter directs you to let SSA know right away so your benefits can be restarted without you having to submit a new application. So that is another option for you. If you were not doing substantial work in any month during that time (since ###20), you will want to contact them immediately, as it is already ###rd.Currently, you are in your extended period of eligibility" (###20 - ###23) where SSA will restart payments for any month(s) your work is not substantial if your health problems still meet their rules. So short answer yes SSDI can be given back to you during this period if your work activity shows you are unable to do substantial work as a result of your health problems so long as those health problems still meet their rules. Continue to report your income to SSA each month and make sure you attend all scheduled medical appointments so that you can request reinstatement of benefits during the extended period of eligibility if you meet the requirements. I hope this information is helpful to you.Shannon Boyce Esq."43924.3270833333 Apply.

Are you there?  43959.6229166667 Hi Qingchen,Hope you're doing well!FICA relates to social security and medicare, and is not related to unemployment.  So FICA should not affect your friends ability to receive unemployment.  It is possible that the employer meant FUTA, which does relate to unemployment benefits.  If your friend is a resident alien for U.S. tax purposes, her employer likely should have been paying FUTA.  Your friend should see if her employer was paying FUTA.  Or, your friend should try the DUA office and ask specifically for J-###.  Is your friend a teacher or a student?  How long has your friend been in the United States?  These are some factors that affect whether her employer was required to pay FUTA. Sorry I can't be more of a help - this is a really complex issue.  It may be worth your friend reaching out to an immigration attorney.

You are collecting SSDI. Your daughter lost her job. You applied for a part-time job but never started it. So you want to know if you can collect PUA benefits while on SSDI? In general, an individual on SSDI can earn up to a certain amount each month without affecting their benefits. If you were working and earning within that amount, and still collecting SSDI, then if you lost that job you could file for unemployment benefits... or in this case PUA, and collect those benefits while also still collecting your SSDI. If you were working up until recently, and PUA determined that you were eligible for benefits, then yes, you could continue to collect SSDI while receiving PUA benefits. However, you stated here that you never started working that job. If you were not working before COVID-19, or did not lose work as a result of COVID-19, I think it will be unlikely that they will approve a benefit claim for you as you did not suffer a loss of income as a result of COVID-19. Not being able to start a new job because your car was repossessed likely will not be considered a COVID-related incident for this claim. Also, in order to collect benefits each week, you have to certify that the only reason you are not working right now is because of COVID-19. But again, you stated you are not working because your car was repossessed. So you would have to answer No" to that question each week and that would make you ineligible to collect benefits for that week."43970.2715277778 Hi ###,Yes, PUA benefits are considered unearned income, and unearned income does not affect pay under SSDI.  Hope this helps, ###43971.2034722222 Iâ€™m told by a lawyer because itâ€™s unearned income it wonâ€™t affect my ssdiis true43967.4965277778 Hi i am on ssi and have been for many years i have my stipend check for $###'s not child support money it's money to support my child which seems like double talk to me now they are taking $### $###'s grandmother because my son's mother lost custody when he was ###'t care and that I owe more child support even though that stipend check comes out of my social security instantly every month but they don't count that as child support?43970.8895833333 I'm afraid I really don't understand the situation here.  If you are on SSI, you would not have anything taken from your benefits for child support. This is because SSI is considered the minimum amount a person needs to live.If you are on SSDI, a separate benefit for your child would go to the person who has custody of that child, but your benefits would not be reduced as a result. If you are on Social Security retirement and you owe child support from the past, DOR may deduct something from your retirement benefit to pay back support.I believe that the stipend as a result of the COVID-###.  Stipend money paid should not reduce your regular benefits but it will also not reduce any child support that is coming out of your benefits or as a result of your benefits on an ongoing basis.43994.6520833333 Hi ###,Hope you are doing well during this crazy time.  Your SSDI benefits should not interfere with your ability to collect PUA benefits.  Massachusetts generally allows people to collect full SSDI benefits and full unemployment benefits.

Iâ€™ll see if I can get in touch with them again because itâ€™s different departments (DUA vs PUA)43997.4784722222 Hi ###,I'm sorry this is such a mess for you!  I honestly don't know what to tell you, other than to keep calling them!  Can you scan a copy of your SSI approval letter?  That might be helpful.  I'm assuming you applied for SSI before applying to PUA?  I believe if you are approved for SSI, you would receive benefits dating back to your application date.  In that case, I think they would count any money you received from PUA during that time.  Wishing you luck!###43998.2395833333 Hi ###,It is strange that SSI told you you were denied, but you received a letter that you were approved.  Do you have an online account that you can check?  I would expect that is the most accurate. You can receive both SSI and unemployment at the same time (see, for example, this site for more information:  https://www.masslegalservices.org/content/43-persons-receiving-social-security-disability-or-retirement-benefits-or-pension).  So you should keep claiming PUA.   If you end up receiving benefits from SSI, any benefits your receive from unemployment will be counted as income, and your SSI benefits may be reduced while you are on PUA.  This may or may not result in your SSI benefits being suspended, but you can have your disability restarted once you stop receiving unemployment. If you are on SSDI (as opposed to SSI), your PUA benefits will not count as income, and your benefits will not be reduced. Hope this helps!### 43997.26875 Hi ###,It is strange that these are both dated the same day, though it looks as though your claim was denied.  I think you might need a specialist.

You can also just call your DTA worker (get the worker's number from your last ### notice) They will likely terminate your ### -- it may take a few weeks for them to do that.  You want to call so that you don't get charged with an overpayment later.When your ### stops, they should continue your SNAP at the old amount under a program they call TBA (transitional benefit alternative) for ###.  This is important because other wise the unemployment would make you ineligible for SNAP.  I know this is confusing -- and a lot of abbreviations!  Just go ahead and report as quickly as possible.

I was working part time about 10-###, but due to my medical condition, I have a letter from a doctor stating that I cannot work my part time job because of the risk if I contract it. I did not qualify for regular unemployment, but I applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and was approved. I gave them all the information about how much I earned when working and also checked off that I am disabled. My plan is to return to work at the same amount of hours before once it is safer to do so. I have tried to contact the social security office and unemployment to find out for sure if that is okay to collect SSDI and PUA, but I can't get through to speak to anyone at either place. The best I have been able to do is look up the answer on Google and I keep seeing conflicting answers. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.44032.2152777778 If you were limited to part-time work by your disability and are prepared to return to work at the same level when it is safe to do so, I see no problem with you collecting SSDI and PUA at the same time.  Yur part-time work was not causing yuoouto be found not disabled, and you have lost that part time work due to COVID 19.  that is the income that PUA is intended to replace.  It is not inconsistent with either the  rules or the principles of either program for you to collect both.44032.5069444444 I contracted Lyme disease last ### and it went ### for a few months until I finally ended up in the hospital in August. By that point I was really sick and had facial palsy, extreme joint pain, memory issues and migraines.  I was going to go out on FMLA then but my work told me to just use up my ### time and get better. When I thought I was healthy enough I went back to work but ended up calling out sick all the time because I was constantly in pain. I thought it was as unfair to my coworkers to be calling out and leaving them short staffed last minute. So I approached management and said I think it would be better if I went out on FMLA, get the rest I needed and get to my doctors appointments. They reluctantly agreed.Just as I was getting ready to go back COVID hit. My doctors didnâ€™t want me to put myself at risk by going back because Iâ€™m on immunosuppressive medications. My job basically said come back or I would be out of a job. So I forced myself back and it didnt go well. Iâ€™m still having complications from the Lyme disease and still having to call out frequently. I called out again a week ago and they said that now I am considered a per diem employee. I work as a veterinary technician at a fast ### emergency and speciality hospital. I work 12-###â€™m lucky if I get a break.  Unfortunately this is the ### in this industry and Iâ€™m used to it and Iâ€™ve done this line of work my whole career. It now appears with the Lyme disease Iâ€™ve developed all sorts of symptoms that make it impossible to continue down this career path. So I donâ€™t know if I qualify for unemployment or social security? And I also not sure if accepting a per diem position from them is the right move, which honestly at this point I donâ€™t think I could do anyway. I feel like if they fired me I could collect, but they didnâ€™t. So Iâ€™m completely lost on what I should do. I have a Morgage and car payment, no kids but plenty of homeless animals that depend on me. Please help! Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to lose everything! Thank you for your time in advance and I appreciate any advice you have to give. I have plenty of doctors notes if you need to see them. Sincerely, ###44034.7875 I suggest that you get a letter from your doctor indicating that due to covid-###.  That will make you eligible for unemployment benefits that are available now due to covid-19.  If you feel your condition is so debilitating, you could also apply for disability payments.  That standard is very difficult to meet as you need to prove that you cannot engage in substantial activity for the next ###.  However, although seeming in conflict, unemployment and social security disability are not.  With unemployment, you need only be able to work part time with or without a reasonable accommodation to your disability; with social security disability, you must be able to work full-time.  The doctor's letter will also be important if you decide to go the disability route.  There are ###:  social security disability insurance or  SSDI which requires that you have had at least ###.  Supplemental Security Income or SSI is for individuals who do not have an earnings history.  With SSI, if you have any additional benefits, those get deducted from SSI.For both unemployment and SSDI/SSI, I suggest you look at all the helpful information on www.masslegalhelp.org  Best of luck to you.44037.7604166667 Was just denied for SSDI.

I would like to know if I would be in trouble for accidentally not knowing that I was supposed to let know DTA on time about the pua Unemployment assistance? & would they be able to let me pay it back since it was a huge mistake I did let my case worker know that I just moved to an housing apartment. And that I didnâ€™t know that I had to report that I was getting Pua assistance. Are they willing to work with me on a payment plan? 44193.8861111111 Hello, I am a retired lawyer who has volunteered to respond to some of the family law questions on Mass. Legal Answers On-Line (MLAO").  I will try to respond helpfully to your questions.I will not comment about the Social Security Administration paperwork or "waiver" process.  Although it obviously directly affects your family I am not familiar with it.  I do not understand why (according to the second attachment) you will be receiving a significant amount in ###.  I can offer nothing that might help you although I respect your persistence in seeking these family funds.There may be a remedy in the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court that ordered the father's child support.  I am not sure if your case would start with your filing a Complaint for Contempt or a Complaint for Modification against the father.  "Contempt" would mean that he disobeyed the court order; whereas "Modification" would mean that circumstances have changed and new orders are needed.  Without knowing more I would lean toward "contempt even though his actions might not have violated the exact terms of the court order (but they violated the spirit of supporting his children according to his means).The Probate and Family Court proceedings also might be unusually slow and frustrating, because the courts are limited by the Covid-###.  Ultimately, you would have a good chance to prevail, I believe; but it might take many months and a few trips to court.  You could apply to South Coastal Counties Legal Services, ###, to apply for free legal assistance.Good luck.  44248.7013888889 Hello, again.  The proposition that a parent in Massachusetts has a duty to support his children to the extent he has the ability is said by the courts to be a policy" underlying Massachusetts child support laws and part of Massachusetts' unwritten Common Law.  It is not a written law or a statute by itself.  But I recall seeing it said in many decisions of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ("###") which are reported in the Massachusetts law books.   You might more quickly find a good reference by looking at the Massachusetts General Laws Annotated ("MGLA") Chapter ### Section 28 ### #### & ### and then looking at one or more of the recent ### decisions cited there.  Note that I did not use your phrase "according to his means because that phrase implies a formula (according to the parents' means), which is found in the current Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines.Good luck.     44255.6923611111 Mr ###,Great advice regarding contempt" Thank you.Mirande Dupuy"44248.7604166667 Mr. ###,Hi. Can you please help me?I am trying to find a law or case that more or less states/infers what you said in your letter to me: that the parent has a duty to support his children according to his means.Thank you, Mirande Dupuy44254.6604166667 My estranged husband received early retirement in ### 62. I managed to get control of the payments to our two children because they lived with me. Since then he has overworked basically continuously and the children's payments are ### as a result. Currently, there is an overpayment of $###,### ###21. I was notified of the overpayment last year and prepared and submitted a Waiver application to the SSA--apparently, due to Covid my paperwork was not processed and I am in the process of preparing another Waiver. (These applications are over ###--extremely hard form!)Compounding this, I have been receiving SSI benefits for emotional and cognitive issues associated with  financial and emotional abuse from my estranged husband. In December I turned 62, and now my payments will come from his SS account. I received a notification that I also will be ### until May for his overworking.I receive $###, and ### $###, which are now being terminated because I make too much money! My question is: Why do my children and I get punished for his misconduct? Can he be forced to give me the extra money that he earns from overworking? I have several more documents that I am unable to attach.44216.7402777778 You will lose your benefits in the month the settlement is available to you, even if you transfer it to someone else whether as a gift or as repayment of a legitimate loan. There is no way around this since it counts as income to you.  What you do with it afterwards determine whether you will be able to continue to receive SSI for the months after you receive the settlement.If you leave in in the bank, then your benefits will stop because you will have resources in excess of the ###,###.  If you transfer it to someone else whether that transfer will allow you to start collecting again depends on who you give to and why.If you give it to someone with getting something of an equivalent value in return, the SSA will continue to regard it as yours.  Paying off a legitimate debt is a completely legitimate way of spending down the settlement and maintaining your eligibility as would be spending the money or goods for your own use, or advance paying ###s such as rent or car payments.Whatever you do you will need to notify the SSA in writing of the receipt of the funds, and how you spent it down. You will need to provide proof of what you spent the money on, or if you use it to repay a loan, you will need proof that you paid it and proof that you really owed the other person the money that you gave them.  I recommend you write up a summary of all of the transactions and provide copies of all checks, receipts and other documentation.  This should include the paperwork from the settlement, a copy of the check, the bank statement showing the deposit of the settlement check, and then the withdrawals or checks that you made as you spent down the settlement through purchases or ### and loan payments.  Good luck.### ###44224.1090277778 im currently receiving SSI, I'm entitled to a large sum of money.  I owe my son's step father for debt incurred, for care of my child.   We are legally divorced and do not reside together.    I owe medical debt and educational debt and that would basically tally up to the total sum of money I get for settlement.  Im signing check over to step dad to pay the debts he incurred while caring for son, all medical expenses and educational debt.   Will I still lose my ssi if the settlement is being signed over to the step dad I owe?   If so what avenues can I take in order not to lose my benifts?44224.0111111111 If you become ineligible for SSI, then your child will be subject to parent-to-child deeming of income and resources.  This is a very complicated subject, but in general, any resources you have which are above the SSI limits will be counted as your child's resources and potentially make the child ineligible.  Resources which would not be counted for an SSI recipient(principally a home and car) would not be deemed and would not cause ineligibility.  I am attaching some further information.  You may also be able to get some advice on this from Community Legal Aid. https://communitylegal.org/contact/  44236.6576388889 My pleasure44236.7708333333 Thank you so much44236.7527777778 im currently collecting ssi and I'm getting a large settlement, which is going to effect my chances of keeping ssi, unless I do a spend down.

She is not meeting my needs and she is doing what she pleases with the money. She does not let me buy clothing she does not let me buy food. I have a part-time job but itâ€™s not a lot of money so Iâ€™m struggling to buy basic needs, food and clothing etc.. I donâ€™t know what I can do about the situation because SSI just telling me to remove the guardianship. But then the courts are telling me to come in and fill out the paperwork and do all this other stuff but I donâ€™t have transportation to get there how am I going to remove it? and fill out the paperwork and do all this other stuff but I donâ€™t have transportation to get there how am I going to remove it? My payee which is my mother  literally making things difficult. She has a history of being abusive and neglectful to me in my childhood where I was also removed from her care for quite some time . But then she regained full custody and went back to her abusive ways.. Help what can I do in a situation like this? Where are my guardian is being financially abusive. I could attach documents but basically all it is is telling me what I can and canâ€™t do and that she has a gaurdianshipâ€¦ It doesnâ€™t be specific on what exactly type gaurdianship she has.44252.7465277778 Sorry to hear about your predicament.   As long as this person is your guardian, I dont think you will be able to get much help from the SSA to remove her as your payee.

Iâ€™m sorry that youâ€™re dealing with this. I know that when youâ€™re disabled and canâ€™t work, it can be an incredibly stressful experience.There's really no way to know what your chances will be on appeal, but I can tell you that your chances increased just by filing the appeal.Most people who go through the process of applying for Social Security or SSI disability are denied the first time. The chance of getting approved for benefits increase for people like you who take the time to appeal. In fact, ALJs grant almost half of the claims that reach ### means that 50% of disability applicants who take their appeal to an ALJ hearing win their appeal and start receiving disability benefits.In terms of a second non-medical review, the SSA field office has already verified non-medical eligibility requirements (age, employment, marital status, or Social Security coverage information). Unless you reported a change, there shouldnâ€™t be a need to conduct another non-medical review.The bottom line is that ### send you a letter about the decision. If itâ€™s denied, ### include information on how to appeal the decision. If that happens, Iâ€™d suggest at least consulting with an experienced Social Security lawyer to help you get the benefits that youâ€™ve earned.Itâ€™s always best to find referrals for lawyers through family and friends, but you can use one of the lawyer referral services on this list. ### give you contact information for specific lawyers, including lawyers that may offer reduced fees.You can also use www.masslrf.org to get contact information for free and low cost sources of civil legal help, and links to legal information.Click this link for more referrals to other legal help in Massachusetts.Best of luck to you, and thanks for using our site.Be well.###44285.2277777778 Hi, I am in the post ALJ hearing phase of my SSDI application.

You were right to file an appeal  and that should have suspended all collection efforts on the alleged overpayment. When they make a decision on the appeal, if it upholds the overpayment amount you can then file a waiver of the overpayment.  Or you can negotiate for a very low monthly installment payment amount to be deducted from your check.  But in the meantime, you should call whoever sent you the ### (probably just the ###ing department at a Payment Center) and let them know that the overpayment is under appeal.  (This probably wont stop them from continuing to send monthly statements, but it might.)  You also should contact your local office and remind them about the pending appeal so they put a hold on collection.  You should also file a waiver request for the son which will be granted since kids are always entitled to a waiver in this kind of situation.Good luck### ###44323.6131944444 My husband and son's father died in 2017.

Please explain.  It was likely a terrible choice to resign because people who quit are generally not entitled to unemployment benefits.  This is merely a Q&A site so no attorney from this site can represent you.   43965.0791666667 Thanks for your reply. I resigned because the boss sent me an email saying my personnel file will look better. I thought it might have negative effect for my future job looking. In my employee handbook, the company requested a 30-day notice but the boss asked me to to include the effective date of my resignation the same day as I sent out the letter. I'm not sure if the employer should still pay for the notice period if they asked me to terminate immediately. 43965.0881944444 This is greeting from ###. I've been in St. ### for about ###. I was employed by a St ### local medical practice on ### ###. But on ### via a phone call, she required me of resigning from the job because I was not calling her as she requested the day before. Later, she sent me an email and asked me to resign by myself with a reason that my personnel file would not look bad. I was afraid of what she said and sent her a resignation letter later that day. I was not making fatal mistakes during my tenor there but sent her couple of emails to show my frustration and expect we could improve the way we communicate. She deleted my company account immediately after she asked me to resign on the phone. I'm wondering if you can help me to protect my legal benefits from this case.43964.9659722222 You are welcome.  You didn't state whether the purpose of your post was to ask whether you could still qualify for unemployment if you quit.  If that is your question, then my answer is that you can go ahead and apply and argue that you were effectively terminated. Most likely you will lose but it might be that your employer does not contest the claim or maybe you'd prevail. 43965.7583333333 Good Morning, Mr. Hughlett, I am sorry that you suffered a back injury but I am glad that you reached out.  I am a workers' compensation attorney over in the St. ### metropolitan area, but the work comp laws are the same for the entire state.  I would like to clear a few things up for you.  You have ### ### (whichever is longer) to either settle your claim or file a Claim for Compensation.  This is called the Statute of Limitations.  This also means that you could either wait for a while to see how your back does before settling or you can hire a lawyer to file a Claim for Compensation and then you can wait as long as necessary to feel you are at maximum medical improvement. You can file a Claim for Compensation yourself as well to preserve the case for longer if that is what you wish to do. I am attaching a copy of the required form.  You need to be careful with this though because if you miss the Statute of Limitations you will be barred from proceeding with the case.  Consequently, I always recommend that you get a lawyer and get a claim on file as soon as possible.  You are correct that if you settle now they will not pay for anymore treatment relative to this injury, however, there are a few scenarios that can happen:If you hurt your back again doing something at work this is actually a NEW work comp injury and even with a preexisting back injury they may have to provide treatment on the new claim so long as your new incident is the prevailing factor (reason above all others) for the injury and need for treatment.  They may argue that it is from your prior injury but the case law states that even with a preexisting condition they are on the hook so long as you meet the prevailing factor test. But lets say you tweak your back at home doing something minor.  Whether the case is open or not they will argue they don't have to provide treatment. Whether it is because you have not healed or from a unrelated new injury at home depends on what the doctors say. If your back is just troubling you and you think you need to be seen again this would need to be on the original claim and for that reason, if you are worried about it you should not settle your claim right away. I do not know enough about your claim but it some cases, if a doctor says you will need more treatment in the future, they have to provide an open medical even after the case settles.  This means that they will continue to authorize and direct your care well after any settlement.  Please note this is rare though and is almost always a fight to get.   Another thing I would like to mention is that whatever they are offering you, they have more.  Right out of law school I was a defense attorney for work comp insurance companies.  I learned a lot through that process and couldn't stomach it.  I quickly changed sides to represent people.  They will low ball you. I always recommend you get an attorney to help you with all of this because even though you are paying a lawyer (most likely 25%) because most of the time they will make that up and still ensure you get more at the end of the day. Although I have given you limited answers above every case is unique and there are a hundred more scenarios that an attorney could help you navigate within your s###fic case.  So before you settle, I would highly recommend speaking to an attorney about all the s###fics on your case.  Consultations are normally free and you pay nothing up front so it at least gets you more knowledge before moving forward.  I hope I was able to provide you with sufficient answers but should you have any follow-up questions please do not hesitate to reach out.

Your employer would be notified that a claim exists but they really don't get too involved with the settlements.  It is primarily the Work Comp insurance company that will work with you to settle your claim.  Keep in mind that a claim has been created in the court already, the only thing you would be doing is preserving the statute and/or hiring a lawyer to represent you on the already existing claim.  An employer cannot penalize you for hiring a lawyer or preserving your rights.  There is a specific statute that provides a second cause of action for retaliation.  It should not affect your job in any way. With that being said, some employers (mostly small employers) sometimes will make comments about it.  In rare and extreme cases I have seen people get terminated but again, those people have a new cause of action.  Most employers are smarter than that.  I hope this helps you decide how to move forward.  ### R. ### ###, ###, & ### 43978.5680555556 I was offered a final settlement from worker's comp for a back injury last October. The Dr. told me my case would be open for two years from the date of the injury. He also said I would not recover 100% but have issues the rest of my life. I still have pain but not enough to prevent me from doing my job. If I accept their offer they won't cover any future injuries from what I understand. If I decline the offer will I be eligible for coverage if I have any back injuries in the future or is the settlement the best way to handle this situation?43965.1701388889 Thank you for your timely reply and advice. I would guess my employer would be notified if I choose the fight the work comp settlement. What are my chances of retaliation from my employer? Is the employer penalized for a work comp claim/settlement? I like my job and don't want to jeopardize my employment. 43974.7243055556 I need someone to help with my LTD insurance.

I need HELP please!sincerely,### Figge43970.75 Hi ###,I'm sorry to hear that you suffered a seizure at work. But it sounds like you ### your doctor have them under control now. Unfortunately, in Missouri, not every incident at work is covered under the Work Comp laws. From your description of your history of seizures, I do not believe your seizure at work would be covered. Unless there was something particular about your job or workplace that caused the seizure, it would likely be found NOT to be covered under the work comp laws.Unfortunately, this also means that your medical bills related to that seizure would not be covered by work comp. Regarding your statement that it was not safe for you to return to your job after that seizure, you may be correct.  However, it seems you were lucky and nothing bad happened when you returned so I do not believe you would have any damages for a negligence claim. Please feel free to call my office if you would like to discuss this in more detail.  Otherwise, I am glad you are doing well and I wish you the best in all your future endeavors.### ###The ### Law FirmPerryville, MO###-###43991.1493055556 i had a seizure at work while i was running the lathe but at least i was smart enough to stop it and get away before it happened, i dont remember it, because i was having a seizure, but for one thing they let me come back and go right back to the machine again the very next day i think i came back, and that was wrong, the doctors always said i shouldnt even be driving or running a machine like that untill i havent had a seizure for at least ###, and also they put me in an ambulance and took me to the hospital and when i woke up i just said let me sign my paper to let me out of here, i just had a seizure, they cant do anything for me, and then for years after that i kept getting bills from the ambulance and hospital and i didnt understand, untill ### at work finally told me that should have been covered by workers comp. and i was also getting phone calls from collection agencys , so after he told me that then i told them when they called that it should have been covered by workers comp. i think i stopped some of the phone calls and now i have changed my number also so they dont know it, so really i dont know if they paid it or not, thats what i mean about ### electric, they are cheap and dont want to pay their bills, they were trying to make me have to pay for that when it happened at work,, i have had seizures since i was about ### ###, and i do finally did get a doctor about ### ### ###, my point is though they shouldnt have let me come back and work on those machines like that after that happened, i really could have hurt myself even killed myself if i fell into the running lathe having a seizure43986.8659722222 What is it you want from the employer?

Are you sure the employer did not have Comp coverage? If it had more than ###. If your claim is for less than $5,###. Hope this helps. 43994.6840277778 Good Morning, Mr. Dopp, I am an attorney in the St. ### Metropolitan area that handles workers' compensation claims and I would be happy to answer your questions.  First off, I am sorry that you have been injured at work.  The work comp system in Missouri can be very difficult to understand so I will add some detail here along with some helpful forms for your review.  Also, here is a link to various resources from the Department of Labor Workers' Compensation: Injured Workers.  An Entry of Appearance means that an attorney has entered the case to represent the insurance company and your employer.  This ty###lly happens after your have reached what is called maximum medical improvement" and the doctor has fully released you.  In Missouri cases they owe you three major benefits: ###.  They must pay all the relevant medical bills and provide you treatment that will "cure and/or relieve the effects of your injury" ###. They must pay you ###/### and ###. They must pay a settlement once you have reached maximum medical improvement for the disability you will have going forward. There are a few ancillary benefits too such as mileage if they sent you out more than ###.  They also owe for disfigurement/scarring if applicable.  So what happens next? The defense attorney that has entered will contact you and provide a settlement amount.  This amount will likely be way less than your injury is worth.  Keep in mind they represent the insurance company and their goal is to give you less and save them money.  This is where it is extremely helpful to have an attorney on your side.  Although you pay a fee to an attorney (most likely ###5% of whatever settlement you get at the end) that attorney should get you way more than you could get on your own.  If you choose to continue representing yourself however you can negotiate with them.  If you reach an agreement you will have to do a conference with the a judge to confirm that you are comfortable with the settlement.  Right now a lot of these are occurring by phone because of the coronovirus.  I am attaching the Disability Chart for your review.  The settlement is based on three factors: The body part injured (back and ribs are at the body as a whole ### ###); Your rate that ###/###; The percentage of disability given your injuries treatment and continued complaints/problems.  It looks like this: Body Chart level (### ###) x ###/### = Lump Sum Settlement. Here is an example: Say a person have a herniated disc in their back and has surgery.  Surgery went well and is doing well.  In St. ### I would settle this case for ###5% of the body as a whole.  Say that person has an injury date of ### and is at the maximum rate on the chart.  The formula would look like this: ### ###5% x $5###4.###0 = $5###4###0.00.  However most injuries are worth less than this.  A person who has a sprain/strain of the back had physical therapy and only has a rate of $###00.###: ### 5% x $TERM00133### = $###.  Another factor that comes into play is where you are injured.  Different ### have different values.  I hope this information helps you to decide how to proceed.  I would highly recommend having an attorney represent you to get what you deserve. However you are free to represent yourself.  If you have any more questions please feel free to reach out.  Good Luck! ### R. ### ### ### & ### ### ### Lake St. ### MO 6######67### "44007.6104166667 On 13 ###, cracking ###, and injuring left knee requiring surgery.  I returned to work on 11 ###.

Thank you.44007.0493055556 Thank you for your help, Miss ###.  This helps much.44008.4055555556 Hello,I will try to answer your question. If my answer does not help you, please post a NEW question because once an attorney chooses a question to answer, it is removed from the line and no other attorney will answer it.First, at age ###, you are probably not full retirement age but you are older than 62 (the minimum age to apply for retirement benefits). If that is correct, you will receive less than 100% of the amount you could receive if you wait until full retirement age. After full retirement age, Social Security adds 8% a year to your retirement amount if you delay taking benefits. So please consider whether you want to apply now or wait. Applying now will reduce your benefits if you are not full retirement age.Second, it is possible to apply online but I do not recommend that, because you will not be able to talk to anyone and so you will not be able to ask questions or get advice from the Social Security representatives who work in the area of retirement benefits.To get the most benefit out of the Social Security representatives who work in this area, I would suggest that you either call Social Security or even better, make an appointment at your local office and go in person. The Social Security representative that you will meet with will look at all possible amounts you could receive. For example, if you were ever married more than ten years, they will look up the record on your former spouse. The representative can lay out all your options so you can be fully informed before you make a decision.Here is a link to the Social Security web site that might help you. It should have a telephone number and a link to find a local office if you want to schedule an appointment online. If not, then google a search like Social Security retirement benefits" and that should take you to a page with information about online telephone and office appointments. I would recommend an office appointment.https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-1.htmlGood luck to you."44026.6729166667 I turned ###, ### and need help in applying for my social security retirement money and benefits.44026.6520833333 I haven't received my Stimulus Check44036.1951388889 Mr. ###,You are going to need to determine the status of or eligibility for the stimulus check with the Internal Revenue Service.

Can you recommend someone who will fight for justice44040.7388888889 This is not what you are going to want to hear but the reality is that this is a ### situation for you trying to fight it using traditional means. You may be able to find a lawyer that will take this on for you but only if you pay them on an hourly basis as there is no way to get the SSA to pay your attorney's fees. What is worse, the SSA has no timeline that it has to meet in completing its investigation regarding the matter.Years ago I had a case with a woman in her ### injured at a restaurant that we settled. We tried to settle with Medicare but it never provided a figure as to what it claimed it was entitled.  Eventually, I sent them a check for $###. The check was cashed and a couple of years later I was contacted that this was not allowed. I said fine, then send me something showing what it is that you contend Medicare is entitled to.  I was assured it would be sent. A couple of years later the woman's SS benefits were shorted to address the overpayment despite my never having received anything saying how much they contended they were entitled to receive. I prepared the necessary appeal and filed it with the SSA. After not receiving any response following the time period that the SSA told me it had to make a decision I contacted the SSA.  I was then told oh no you misunderstood - we have no timeframe in which we must respond. It may take years before we get around to it! At that point, we presented the information to her US Senator's office and by the next time her check was due to be received, it was a full check.  Never heard from SSA one way or another but the issue simply disappeared.  I suggest that you contact one of the US ### for Missouri with a detailed but brief explanation of what has occurred including your efforts to resolve it and see if that doesn't address your problem.44040.7743055556  good afternoon I need help  I used to work for ### Manor Nursing Home I slipped and fell on Memorial Day had to wait till ###.

Ms. Fry 44056.7833333333 Hello Ms Fry,It sounds like you had an attorney representing you in your workers compensation case. If so, your attorney should answer your questions.

Thank you.44153.7770833333 Hello. You certainly have a right to consult with an attorney at any time you wish. I don't want to discourage you from doing so. However, there are non-profit agencies that assist people with pension problems. Here is a link to one I found in a Google search:https://www.pensionhelp.org/There may be other non-profits or even government agencies who can assist with finding an old pension.I'd do some internet searches. Maybe you'll find a support group online that you can talk to and get ideas from. You're not the first person to need help finding an old pension. There is help out there, in addition to hiring a private attorney.Now that I have responded to your question, your question has disappeared from the queue and no other attorney will be able to answer it. You may direct a follow up question to me, but if you have a new question, you should submit that to the Free Legal Answers web site where you posted this question. 44172.6756944444 I got a notice from SSA called Potential Private Retirement Benefit Information.

You need to contact the authorities. The story, however, does not add up. The stimulus ### direct deposit goes to a bank account that is tied to your tax returns. Did you file tax returns the last couple of years? The deposit was made to whatever bank account you have listed in your tax returns. If no bank account is informed, IRS sends the check to the physical address listed in your tax return. If you did not file taxes, odds are you did not get a stimulus check.On the paternity front, there are many different places on or around ### City that you can get free representation. Missouri law allows a man alleging himself to be the father of a child to file a lawsuit seeking to have his paternity rights determined. Part of that lawsuit is doing a paternity test. Bear in mind that, if paternity is in fact established, you will be under obligation to provide child support.Below, there are several resources available that you may qualify for (if you qualify for Medicaid, you most likely will qualify for these). The links below are for the Legal Aid of Western Missouri, which offers pro bono representation in your area, and a list of discounted & pro bono services that may also be available in your area:###/###/Because I do not know if you qualify for any of the services in the links above, another option would be to hire an attorney for limited scope representation. The lawyer search feature at ### allows the public to search for family law attorneys who will provide limited scope representation. Limited scope representation essentially means that you can hire the lawyer to do specific tasks, like advise you on (###) the best course of action in this case, (###) how to properly file a lawsuit to determine paternity yourself, and (###) tell you exactly what needs to be included in the paperwork, as well as what kind of evidence you need. This keeps costs down, and may be a great help in making sure the court is fully aware of all the circumstances surrounding the case without bankrupting you in the process.

This forum is for asking specific questions about civil law but it is not an attorney referral service or a site for finding an attorney to hire.An attorney on this forum cannot guess at whether or not you will be able to hire an attorney to represent you in the civil suit you wish to file.  Most ### lack the education training experience and skill to represent themselves successfully.  The only other question in what you wrote is "please give me your advice on what steps I should be taking."  You need to hire an attorney for advice and representation.   Apparently you disagreed with the advice some attorneys have given you.  Attorneys on this site cannot tell you how to handle your own case if you are asking about representing yourself in the proposed civil action.  The answer to the second question would be that you need to hire an attorney immediately.While I have no way of knowing whether or not you have a viable SSD claim it appears that four years into the matter you have not retained an attorney.  If you have been unable to find an attorney to hire it may reflect on the strength of your disability claim.  It is also possible that you have damaged your case by self-representation for four years.If you were trying to find an attorney who would represent you only on a contingency basis it may be necessary for you to hire an attorney on an hourly basis.  I would suggest you perhaps need to hire an attorney willing to represent you on an hourly basis.  A significant retainer will usually be needed.The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function here:  https://mobar.org/public/LawyerSearch.aspxBest wishes."44203.0416666667 I am at the last stage of my social security appeals process and I have to file a civil action against the commissioner of social security. Will I be able to find an attorney that would help me? I'm not sure how to even fill out the paperwork for the civil action and the lawyers that I have contacted wanted me to lie and reapply to say that I am only now disabled instead of the four years that this has taken. If this whole process is because of the back pay issue on why they are not approving it, please give me your advice on what steps I should be taking. I have been disabled since ###, my therapist and my psychiatrist all filled out the paperwork for social security saying that I could not work but since the case originally started out as a work comp case, I was forced to see two IME doctors and the judge said that one of the IME doctors was the only credible doctor even though he flat out lied (there is proof) in his evaluation of me. I have also been to the ### clinic in MN, so for the judge to say that is rediculous and the judge lied about what I said but I don't know how to get the transcripts from my hearing. I am disabled so it is already hard for me to do things and this situation is hard for me to deal with physically and emotionally.44202.8409722222 Who do I talk to about getting switched from SSI to SSDI considering my condition won't get better44225.5736111111 You should contact Social Security:You can apply for Disability benefits online, or if you prefer, you can apply by calling our toll-free number, 1-800-###.

I am happy to answer your questions.  I am assuming that what you mean by being on workman's comp is that you are currently being paid temporary total disability benefits after a doctor has taken you off of work for a period of time.  If that is the case, it is okay to supplement your income doing Doordash if it can be accomplished within your current work restrictions provided by the doctor.  For instance, if your restrictions say no use of the right hand and you go and drive several hours for Doordash, this would be a violation of those restrictions.  However, if it is a restriction that is, for example, a lifting restriction and the employer cannot accommodate those restrictions and you can drive within the restrictions then you are free to do so.  As for reporting the income, you are supposed to report it to work comp.  They will pay what is called temporary partial disability.  To create your ### amount they would take your average weekly wage, subtract the money made with door dash and then pay you ###/###.  Because of this, you want to make sure that the additional work would actually benefit you. After you are released from any kind of restrictions from the doctor, you are free to work wherever and it would not impact you at all.  This is really for the period of time that they would be paying you TTD benefits.  If you have any other questions or would like to speak more in detail do not hesitate to contact me. ### R. ### ###, ###, & ###, PC ### Lake St. ###, Missouri 63367### phone ### fax 44238.9034722222 Is it legal to deliver food through doordash while on workmans comp at my main job?

So if you are unable to pay back your Social Security overpayment, filing for bankruptcy can allow you to discharge your obligation to the SSA. However, the SSA has the right to object to your discharge if it believes you were committing fraud by accepting the additional payments.You mention the IRS in your question. How is the IRS involved in this? Do you have a debt to the IRS? Debts to the IRS are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.If you do not wish to file bankruptcy, another option would be to contact the Social Security Administration and try to negotiate a payment plan to repay the overpayment. They may be willing to settle for less than the full amount.Best of luck. Let me know if you have any further questions.44251.1298611111 I have had my Social Security disability benefits taken away.

This site does not provide actual representation, and I suggest you confer either with your prior attorney or another attorney who is familiar with social security law.Your attorney can review the factual and legal situation in depth, and advise you as to your options.  You can then decide the best way to handle this matter.  An attorney on this site would not be able to evaluate whether you have any defenses to the social security overpayment claim.While the best recommendations frequently come from satisfied friends or family, the Missouri Bar also has an attorney search function here:  https://mobar.org/public/LawyerSearch.aspxBest wishes.44285.1965277778 i have received a letter from social security claiming i was over paid and wants me to pay it back.  but i had an attorney tack care of a ness up around ###.  not sure what to do or how to really go about whats going on.44284.8104166667 Hi ###,My name is Bernardo and I will do my best to answer your question.I do not believe you need to worry about your social security disability benefits. Social Security disability programs are overseen by the federal government, and therefore your benefits will carry over from one state to the next.It is, however, important to notify the SSA of your address change, or any other significant change in living arrangements. Below are several reasons you should notify them as soon as you move:If you receive your Social Security disability benefit checks through the mail, you will want the SSA to know your new address before you actually move, in order to avoid delays in receiving your checks or your checks being delivered to your old address.If you receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI), itâ€™s important that the SSA is aware of your move to another state because it will affect any state supplements you receive to your SSI benefits. It will also affect the way those supplemental benefits are administered. For example: Missouri administers their own supplements, while the SSA itself administers supplements on behalf of the state of California.Simply to keep the SSA records up to date and current.When the SSA sends you information regarding your ongoing benefits and any requirements you may have to fulfill to maintain eligibility, you will want to receive it at your current address.Furthermore, if you are entitled to state supplements, your total benefits may go up or down. I assume California pays more supplemental benefits than Missouri due to the higher cost of living. You should be aware, however, that statesâ€™ requirements for state supplements to social security payments vary.Does this answer your question? Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions.Regards,Bernardo44327.6631944444 I receive social security disability in Missouri and want to move closer to my son in California. Can I move my SSAto California? I'm trying to relocate to a senior living facility in ###, CA44327.6125 Yes indeed! Thanks for your help Bernardo44327.8875 Dear ### - thank you for your quick response. This is a bit overwhelming, and I will be seeking legal aid to help with it. I have a question about your suggestion to do an online non disability appeal. I am not sure which form this, when I look at the options on the SSA website it shows -  ###. Form SSA-56###, Request for Reconsideration. You should explain why you think you have not been overpaid or why you think the amount is not correct"OR ###. "If you agree that you have been overpaid but you feel you should not have to pay it back because you did not cause the overpayment and you cannot afford to repay it you should file Form SSA-6###### Request for Waiver of Overpayment Recovery"OR ###. "If you agree that you have been overpaid and are willing to pay it back but cannot afford to pay it back at the rate we tell you in the letter you should file Form SSA-6###4" Request for Change in Overpayment Recovery Rate.Would your suggestion be the Request for Reconsideration form SSA-56### or something different? Do you have a sense of what the best legal arguments to justify why I do no think I caused the overpayment? I was unaware that I was making above the threshold and was never notified at any point during the year. I really appreciate your insights. I attached the actual letter this time which it would not let me upload before.Thanks again.TERM00091###"44335.6180555556 Hi, ###,You are filing a Request for Reconsideration, that is you are appealing the amount and whether you were overpaid. Then assuming you lose that, you will file a request for a waiver of the amount due.You can printout out and use the SSA-###: https://secure.ssa.gov/iApplNMD/startGood luck,### ###44335.70625 I have received an SSI overpayment letter in the mail dated ###th, that states I owe 19,### ###/### ###/2021. I receive SSI because I am blind. I switched to working full time two years ago, but thought I was earning an amount for which I would still be able to receive my SSI and health insurance, since I do not get it through work. I don't understand what change in ###20, other than Covid hit, that would have changed my situation and made me not qualify. In ### 29,###. I live in ### with my wife, who has been unemployed this past year, finished her PhD and is unable to find employment. She owes ###,###. I also have a five year old son. Even with the SSI we are living paycheck to paycheck. I don't know what SS form I should fill out in response to this letter - an appeal, a request for waiver, or a change in payment. Taking on a 20,###. I did not contact the SS department directly to tell them of my change in employment to full time, because in the past it has always adjusted based on the my taxes/income. I do not understand why they would pay me for a full year before I was told I did not qualify. I did not hide my income, it is reported on my taxes, and I thought because I was supporting a family of ###. Do I have any legal grounds to waive this overpayment? What is my next best step? I greatly appreciate any advice. Our local SS office did not let us make an appointment, and are not taking walk ins, but we will continue to try to schedule an appointment with them to get a clearer picture.44334.6256944444 The SSA is notoriously bad when it comes to dealing with people who are on benefits and also working.  They are not adequately trained in doing the complicated calculations to determine whether your countable income" was in fact over the limit in a particular month or in averaging your income appropriately to determine your countable monthly earnings.You should ###) file an online "nondisability" appeal of the decision and ask for all documents and calculation worksheets showing how they decided that you were overpaid and how they determined the total you supposedly owe.  Once you file the appeal that should stop any further collection efforts until you get the documents you requested and file a response as part of your appeal. Then even if the overpayment is upheld on reconsideration you will then have the right to file for a waiver of the overpayment where you will be able to try to prove that you were not at fault in causing the overpayment and that you cannot afford to pay it back without using money you need for your family's basic living expenses.  Filing this waiver will continue to keep the SSA from collecting until a decision is made.Separate from the above you should figure out how to ensure that your current earnings are below the limit so none of the above keeps the SSA from sending you continuing payments while they are considering your appeal and waiver request.  Finally even if you lose all the appeals you can request a very small interest free installment payment plan of as little as $###.  Obviously this is all very complicated it would be very helpful if you obtained a legal advocate who is experienced in the SSA overpayment rules and regs.  If you need help finding someone like that you might consider calling the National Organization of Social Security Claimants Representatives (NOSSCR) lawyer referral service     ###/Good luck### ###"44335.5555555556 I am suing the Massachusetts Department Of Transitional Assistance (DTA) over lost SNAP food stamps benefits.At the Form ### hearing for loss of SNAP food stamps due to power outage, I claimed shouldn't be held responsible for the USPS mail delay the DTA claims occurred. (I forgot to buy delivery confirmation.) It normally takes two to three days for mail to go between me and the DTA and vice versa. The longest ever was four days, which was over the Thanksgiving federal holiday weekend where the USPS has reduced hours but more usage volume. The DTA says despite no holiday and no inclement weather, it took my SNAP Form ### a total of six days to arrive, making it conveniently late on a deadline that would save the DTA money. I mailed it so even if it'd taken four days, it would still arrive at the DTA on the exact filing deadline day. The DTA hearings officer accepted my argument, then did the calendar math wrong. As in, I started counting the days at one and they decided instead to accept my math but start counting at zero instead. So I am suing because they couldn't count out four calendar days correctly, because that change in method is the difference between me winning and losing my case. The incorrect math is in black and white right there in the DTA decision letter.I am asking the DTA pay damages" to recoup my personal court costs -- printer ink copy paper USPS mail delivery confirmation ### transportation etc. -- because their faulty math is the whole reason for this lawsuit literally they couldn't count to four. And so far it's cost me $###.### $###.###. I think it's perfectly reasonable. Generous even not to also charge them further for my labor in putting all this together. When I read Massachusetts General Laws Chapter ### I couldn't find anything saying I couldn't ask for damages. The day I filed my case in court I asked the court clerk if I could and she said yes and pointed me to the "statement of damages" section. In her "answer to the court" filing the DTA's lawyer doesn't address the basis for my case nor does it ask the judge to dismiss my request for damages.Now in settlement conference the DTA's lawyer is saying I cannot ask for damages in this type of case. I asked her to provide citations or documentation from any source other than herself -- because she has repeatedly lied about basic facts including the content of her previous letter to me so it's not like she's created any basis on which I should trust her not to lie to me to save the DTA money -- but she sent me back a monologue about the difference between UK and US legal systems which is ### not what I asked for.Hopefully as legal experts you'll have citations to answer me."44340.3652777778 Last year when the pandemic hit I was laid off. I applied for food stamps and unemployment. I was approved for both. When applying for food stamps I was not receiving unemployment compensation yet. When I had to decertify my benefits with food stamps they asked if anything changed. I said no, because I was still unemployed and my kids father was still supplying earned income. Not knowing unemployment affected my food stamps because I was unaware it counted as an income. I continued to receive food stamps. Now a year later food stamps contacted me and said I was receiving overpayments and I would be disqualified because I did not report I was receiving unemployment. My question is since this was unintentional, and more than ### â€œ### startedâ€ are they allowed to make me repay all of that amount?

Someone at social security told me it was mine free and clear so I had cashed it and used it to pay off debt at that time. My lawyer helped me file an appeal and sent some letters for me. There was no activity on that case since 2018. I got a letter referring to an overpayment amount, but giving the date ### (when I'd gotten disability the second time in my life after a neurological issue/anxiety and depression issue and this letter I got today was listing no other information.

He said that he'd like to consider this new letter as another issue, (given the ###'t fathom at the time) but that he wouldn't be able to handle it. Is his reasoning sound? Does he still have an obligation to me or a contract with me? Is he angling for a payment? He never stated that outright. I know the pandemic has changed operating procedures for a lot of businesses and maybe contingency fee based work is not making sense for lawyers now?. Is it wiser for me to try to find some way to persuade him to get him to continue his services or is it better to seek help elsewhere? He's stated he doubts I will find someone willing to work on contingency or pro bono. Is he right? I did fill out a legal referral form. I've also requested a more detailed letter from social security since they left out any next steps or what their decision means. I think it's unreasonable to think that a ###'d act on, but they are making a ### ###.

You have to sign up online and call ###-### by noon for same day delivery Monday-Friday and visit their website: https://www.foodpantry.org/get-help/get-food/.Unfortunately, we found the same results that neither ALDI or Walmart via ### offers delivery to ###, though it may be worth reaching out to inform them of the delivery gap in the event they keep track of inquiries like yours.  They may increase service if they know there is a need and interest.Alternatively, SNAP allows you to designate a person you trust as your authorized representative in the event you need someone else to purchase your groceries because of a disability. To do this, you need to sign a DTA (Department of Transitional Assistance) form appointing this person. The DTA Assistance Line is ### for 24/###; case managers are available from 8:15am-4:45pm M-F to discuss this option.

If DTA notices the SNAP balance is too high or has not been used in some time, the beneficiary may receive a call from DTA, as they track SNAP cases that have not been used for several months. However, they will not remove them without notifying you. If SNAP benefits have not been used for a full consecutive year, DTA may seek to  remove benefits from your account; however, even then, they must notify you before doing so.All of this information may be found here in Section ###: https://www.masslegalservices.org/book/export/html/###: https://www.masslegalservices.org/book/export/html/30280.I hope this is helpful and that you find a solution that works for you.Thank you for using MassLegalAnswers.Take care,### 44393.8513888889 My disability causes massive pain that comes and goes.

Iâ€™m very sorry that youâ€™re dealing with this situation.Iâ€™m not sure if the ### Housing Authority (BHA) provides housing assistance to you through a federal or state program, but I can tell you the following:There are only two circumstances under which a state housing authority can increase your rent retroactively:  If you didnâ€™t properly report your income, deductions, exclusions, or household composition as required by the lease, and the BHA later discovers the mistake.If you didnâ€™t complete your recertification in a timely manner, the BHA can make a rent increase back to the time that the recertification ### taken effect. This applies to both the yearly recertification and any interim recertification required by the lease.If you did give them the information in a timely manner, but they failed to process it, the rent increase can be effective only for a future date.If you live in federal public housing, there are no specific rules about whether rent can be increased retroactively.

Because I was prevented from visiting him in ### ###, I changed his status on my tax return for those years.  I said I no longer lived with him.  My question is, will I still collect SSDI for my son despite his not living with me?  This is very important to me.  Thanks, ### Furrer44404.4326388889 It would appear that  your son remains eligible for SSDI child's benefits.  but I want to emphasize that these are HIS benefits, not yours, and if you receive them as his representative payee because he is under ###.  If he were living with you maintaining the home for him would be considered to be for his benefit.  But if he lives with his mother, any money not directly used for his benefit (such as by buying clothes, paying school expenses, etc) should be going to his mother, not to support you.  If he is your natural child, he is eligible regardless of whether he lives with you. A natural child is considered dependent unless he is adopted by someone else.   this is the applicable regulation:Â§â€‰###0###.###50. Who is entitled to child's benefits?(a) General.

A few years I had a young man living with me as a caregiver.  Not officially but that is the best way to describe him. He was going to pay some rent and help me when neededShortly after he moved in i noticed things began to be missing.  I thought i had misplaced themLong story short he never paid rent and began borrowing money from me which he never paid back.  I am not being strategically naive when i say I know nothing about street drugs or drug addicts.  He told me he was addicted to cocaine and that if I didn't keep lending him he would not pay back anything he owed me.The demands became more and more threatening sometimes physically.  The first time he just pushed me until i fell.  He demanded my bank card and pin no.  Over the next months he knew when my Social Security check was being downloaded and drained my bank account.  He also took my checkbook and began signing checks in my name.  There were alot of overdrafts.  Finally, the bank sent me a letter telling me I owed them thousands and they were closing my account.There is more to the situation but I won't go into great detail but the physical and emotional abuse continued.  I was evicted and for a year lived at the VA shelter in Boston.After a year I was told there was an apartment in ### Park where I am living now.I am told the abuser has died.I now have an American Express Serve card with which I can have my Social Security check and Retirement Check automatically deposited.The problem is that there is a daily limit of $###.The nearest bank takes me about an hour to walk both ways.  My rent is about ###.###.In the meantime I have had two strokes and a heart attack and a back injury so that walking is very painfulI live in BHA housing and I would be able to set up an automatic monthly withdrawal for rent but Boston Boston Housing does not accept American Express.I tried opening a new bank account but am told there is a block stopping any bank anywhere that will open a new account.  Until I pay the stolen money back and they probably wouldn't allow me to open an account anyway.  At this time i fall very easily.  The bank seems to feel that the money that was stolen is my responsibility.It's like if a woman is in a violent domestic relationship and her money is stolen no one would say the abuse was her fault but the bank is ### it is my fault.  44412.8583333333 I called social security and was told I started to receive payments in ### 16. The money was put in an account by my sister-in-law because my brother was my guardian. I was not allowed to use it or buy anything except my drivers training course. When I turned ###. Can I find out where it went because I had to pay for my food with my pay from my job. 44421.7951388889 Under Massachusetts law (### ### ch. 190B, Â§ 5-209), at the time your brother was appointed as your legal guardian, he became responsible for applying any of your available money to your current and future care and support, and as your guardian, he was entitled to reasonable compensation for services as a guardian and for reimbursement for those services, but only as approved by the court.  The court order appointing him as your guardian may or may not have required him to keep a record of any expenditures from your estate.  Also under Massachusetts law (### ### ch. 190B, Â§ 5-417), if a conservator was appointed for your estate, that conservator would have been required to file with the court an accounting of your estate within ###.  When you attained the age of 14,  you would have been entitled to receive a copy of that accounting, and any updates to those records upon request. You may be able to obtain a copy of the guardianship and conservator documentation by contacting the Family and Probate Court in the Massachusetts county in which you reside using the link below. https://www.mass.gov/orgs/probate-and-family-court/locations44449.5569444444 Dear ###,I will provide an answer with regard to SNAP below.  If you need further guidance I can provide you the email of my colleague who may provide more details.For SNAP, work study income is not countable as income. So, if the internship or fellowship is funded through work study, that does not count. Also, if the money you earn through the fellowship or internship is not received by you (eg. if it is used to directly pay for a portion of your tuition) then it does not count, either (but it would count if you receive it then use it to pay for an outstanding loan balance, for example). Also, if you receive a one time lump sum (for example, a fellowship pays you a one time stipend of $2,000) that one time payment does not count as income. However, generally, income you earn from an internship or fellowship is countable for SNAP. Here is a list from DTA of the types of income that do NOT count as income for SNAP: https://eohhs.ehs.state.ma.us/DTA/PolicyOnline/BEACON5/!SSL!/WebHelp/SNAP/Eligibility_Requirements/Income/Noncountable_Earned_Income/Noncountable_Income.htmIn terms of reporting to DTA - assuming you are not at a required paperwork period (have not been sent a Recertification packet) you do not need to report to DTA unless your income in a month exceeds 200% of the Federal Poverty Level for your SNAP household size. If you get SNAP just for you, that amount is currently $2,1###7/month (take your weekly income and multiply it by ###.### $2,1###7). If you do go over that amount in a month, then you have to tell DTA by the 10th day of the month following the month you went over. So, if you go over in September, you do not need to tell DTA until ###- meaning you should get your SNAP for September and October, and it should close effective your November issuance date. Here is more information about these rules: https://www.masslegalservices.org/content/99-what-simplified-reporting-and-when-must-i-report-changes-dtaIf you are ###, it is possible you may not need to report the change at all; if this is the case I can refer you to my colleague for more info.Sincerely,###44433.8201388889 Looking for advice. For almost a year, I have been receiving SNAP and ### benefits. I was recently informed that funds received through internships and fellowships may qualify as income under certain circumstances. I am starting a paid internship and a paid fellowship in September. Together, my fellowship and internship would put me over the about $### - December. But what I've found on this topic has just left me confused. I'm afraid of being charged retroactively for these services for not knowing what does and does not count as income. Or for saying I'm receiving X amount of income when that doesn't actually count as income and losing services unnecessarily. Seeking advise on what to do/where to look/who to contact. Thank you!Does money earned through fellowships and internships all always count towards income (re: ### and SNAP)?Does COVID affect this at all?Does being a student categorize me differently at all?44424.9645833333 Please bare with me as I try to explain it and it comes out a jumbled mess.I am a single mom of ###.

Thank you44432.8006944444 My condolences on the death your kids' Dad. Since survivors benefits are subject to a family maximum, I think it is likely that what your getting for the two of them is already at the max and adding the third child will not increase the benefits payable.  You should ask the SSA to tell you if getting your third child acknowledged would increase your benefits or just move some money from the two other kids to your youngest child.If I am correct the only time the third child would be worth adding would be when one or both of the other two kids reached the termination age for benefits which is usually ### ###.

We were not prepared with anything because we JUST got married. We are from MA44447.9048611111 Ms. Damico: For social security survivorâ€™s benefits, you must be married for ###. However, this ### requirement does not apply if (###) you and your spouse have a child who is under ###, or (###) your spouseâ€™s death was accidental. Whether the death is considered accidental depends on the circumstances surrounding the death, and the Social Security Administration would make that determination. You can contact the Social Security Administration for more information by calling ###-800-### and you can review this resource published by the Social Security Administration for more details on eligibility (https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-###0084.pdf). You should look into whether your spouse had a will or if he died without a will. If he died with a will, you should be able to determine what, if any, assets he left for you. But if he died without a will, Massachusetts intestacy laws will determine the distribution of his assets. If he has other family members, it is possible that they will try to contest your marriage and any claim to his assets. There are other assets that are handled by contract, such as retirement benefits as well as bank accounts. For his 40###K, you will need to determine if he named someone as the beneficiary because his 40###k will go to that person. If you had any joint bank accounts with him that were set up with a right of survivorship, then the assets in those accounts would pass onto you.

God Bless. ###, ### and ### ### 44485.3743055556 Full time college students are NOT eligible for SSDI child's benefits44502.8916666667 I think you are mistaken.  As I said earlier, SSI is based on disability, both for adults and children.  What your daughter was getting, I believe, was a child's benefit under Social Security (SSDI), which is available to minor children of disabled Social Security recipients.  that benefit ends if a child reaches age ###.  If she was already in community college presumably she had completed her secondary school education.  Certainly if she had her GED, she would have been considered to have finished high school and therefore her benefits would end at age ###.  If she did not have a GED but was still being ### toward it, she would be eligible up to two months after her 19th birthday, but no further.   If she was not found to be disabled, she was NEVER eligible for SSI.44502.8916666667 Mr. ### ###,Thank you very much for getting back to me. I really appreciate your time and your help. I am on SSDI. When I received SSDI, we were told that our daughter was in titled to receive SSI, until she reached the age of ###. By the time she turned ###, she was already already going to the community college, full-time. SSI, still stopped her benefits. We appealed and were denied. We explained that she was home schooled, taking HiSet courses, College prep courses. Her advisors and the college, confirmed that she was considering a  full-time student, because of her course workload.        It'll be ###, this coming January, since the SSI payments stopped. How long could someone collect SSI, after their ###th birthday, if they are enrolled in school, full-time? Again, thank you for your time and your help. We really appreciate you. Thank you,  ### ### 44502.7493055556 Your question is very confusing.  You state that your daughter received SSDI and SSI.  The SSDI would have been a child's benefit on your account.  She was entitled to receive those benefits, if she was a fulltime student, until she completed her secondary school course or the third month after the month she reached age 19, whichever was earlier.  If she was getting SSI that would have to have been based on her own disability, but you do not indicate that she is disabled.  Eligibility for SSI has nothing to do with whether or not she was ### or in school at all, so the statement that you were told she could not get SSI because she was ### makes no sense.  (Home schooling does count as being a fulltime student for SSDI child's benefit purposes, by the way.)If you can provide some clarifying facts, I am happy to try to help you unscramble this.44502.7305555556 Are capital gains considered working income?
