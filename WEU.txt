When I was employed at the City of ### during these years of 2015, 2016, ###. At the time I was there many changes came upon me in my work life that turned my day to day life from good to bad. I was approached by a lot of people about my life at the City of ### NC while I was working for them. Quite the result that I was never hired by the City of ### NC and other things that destroyed my work life. I got a lot of rough nature turned towards me and used on me while working including excessive profane language said to me on and off the work clock. I had a snake thrown at me, been picked up in the air by other employees and threatened chased around with work tools and among other things called a very derogatory name ###.

I also don't believe you would have a claim even if you did not owe the money, but if you did, it would likely not be worth pursuing.  43690.7277777778 Shortly after quitting my job, an employee of the company released some confidential financial information, regaurding a debt I owed" to the company via a group text. Would I have a legal case?"43654.6409722222 ###, I am responding to your inquiry on the NC Bar Foundations' Free Legal Answers. In this scenario, you are able to file a claim for unemployment through the Department of Employment Security, which you can find here: https://des.nc.gov/des .  You do not need an attorney to file a claim. Based on the facts you have shared, you may have a viable claim for pregnancy discrimination.  If your employer has more than ###, the Federal Law (Title VII) will apply.  If not, the State Law (NC Equal Employment Practices Act) will apply. Here is some more information on this topic under Title VII: ###If you verbally informed your employer that you needed an accommodation based on a condition of your pregnancy, your employer should have initiated what is called the interactive process where the employer would work with you to determine whether it can provide an accommodation.  An accommodation, for example, would be changing your shift, placing you in a different role, etc. If your employer refused to accommodate you, you may well have a concern under the Americans with Disabilities Act and/or the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The first step in a pregnancy discrimination claim is to file a charge with the EEOC, here: ###.  You do not need an attorney to do this first step.  You have ###. I hope this is helpful. 43690.7361111111 I entered my two weeks notice at the ### location I was employed at last month on ### the 20th. I verbally rescinded my resignation two days later on ### the 22nd. The reason I was going to resign in the first place was because my employer was not meeting my verbal ultimatum in that, since informing them I was pregnant on ### the 2nd, and experiencing extreme nausea, vomiting, and morning sickness, I asked not to be the only shift manager in the store and I repeatedly disclosed to them that I couldnâ€™t complete the target business goals because of my new condition. I informed them I wouldnâ€™t be able to continue my duties as a shift leader first on ###th. However, instead of scheduling or calling in help for me, they continued to have me run multiple night shifts on my own. I asked them to demote me so I wouldnâ€™t have shift leader responsibilities any longer on ### the 10th. Instead of accommodating me as their pregnant employee they decided not to inform me they wouldnâ€™t allow me to continue working as manager or crew until ###th, four days before the end of my initial notice and had removed me from the coming weeks schedule completely. They asked me to run one more shift that day on the 30th, and then under emotional duress I left and have been terminated. My question is this: Would this be a viable claim to unemployment compensation or a viable claim for pregnancy discrimination?

The employer is also not permitted to retain custody of your personal belongings and must return those items to you immediately.  This is fairly clear violation of North Carolina Wage & Hour laws.

God bless you and your family this summer.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43668.1895833333 I was a sanitation lead (freezer captain) in a warehouse distribution center. When I first was given the job the supervisors in this particular department I found out were not truthful about the pay or the job functions. As I went forward in my job functions, I began to face several issues going from harassment from others all the way to retaliation. I went through the proper chain of command all the way to Corporate HR to try and have this ongoing issue resolved. Once I made that move it all went downhill.  It also came to the point where comments were made to me like: why don't you just give up this position and go back to a regular position and things will all go back to normal." These comments were made by those in supervisory roles.  They basically wanted me to quit and I continued to work at my job. I was also shunned by employees and supervisors and received bogus write-ups. In addition it was a ### environment as many of the supervisors knew the employees that were on my crew outside of work and many of the employees even became angry because I was serious about my job and the condition in which the freezer was being kept. I gave them orders as I was instructed in the correct manner as to what their job duties were to be when they were on my shift. Many of them became upset because they were used to being able to do what they wanted to do when they wanted to do it. So they would tell others higher than me that I was "yelling at them" because I was giving them these orders. The head supervisor at one point told me I was taking my job too seriously. This position is a serious position as you are dealing with food items and they must be handled in a certain order so that OSHA regulations are met. I never had any problems until I moved to this particular department. I have captured pictures of how the freezer is sometimes left and I had been stuck many times staying after to clean up. I never experienced anything like this on a job for the over three years I was employed there until I moved into this department. They claimed they were letting me go for "misconduct" which is very confusing especially when they brought me in the office and were asking me questions? I did not sign the write up because I did not agree. I did make comments that I am friendly with everyone on the job and try to get along with all. I feel I was set up and that all I experienced on this job was unfair. I felt they did not think I could handle the challenge of the position but once I did and helped to totally clean up the freezer ### began to change. Do you think I have a possible case?"43665.8395833333 I was working as a cook at the same business as my fiancÃ© who was serving. She had a night where the owner/manager wasnâ€™t in the floor at all but still took her share of the tip pool. My fiancÃ© was afraid to say anything, all she would say was â€œthatâ€™s ###â€ or â€œthatâ€™s just the way it goes when you work hereâ€ . Upon learning about this incident, along with other similar ones, I set up a meeting with her husband, who is also part owner, to discuss some issues I had with what was going on within the restaurant. Upon bringing this specific point up in our meeting, the owner became very defensive. Not ###Ã© and I were suspended for ###. I never was spoke to again even after trying and trying to come in contact. My fiancÃ© got a job at another location after ###. I believe my termination was wrongful and would like to know if I have any options. Thank you 43667.7840277778 Mr. ###:Thank you for your question; I am sorry to hear of this termination.  Reading your fact pattern a couple times to make sure I understood, I would say that it is more likely than not that your termination was legal, although it certainly sounds unfair.  Unless there was a written contract to the contrary, you would have been considered an at-will employee by default under North Carolina law, which ###s that an employer can fire you for almost any reason, or no reason at all, at any time.  Exceptions include (###) illegal discrimination under federal and/or state law (such as on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, disability or age if over 40), (###) violation of public policy, or (###) retaliation for engaging in a legally protected activity.  Absent strong proof of one of these three, it is almost impossible to win a lawsuit for wrongful termination in North Carolina, whether under federal or state law.Nonetheless, you might wish to consult briefly (### ###, perhaps) with a local employment law attorney to see if Exception (###) might be in any way applicable.  There is a slight chance that you could argue that you were engaging in a legally protected activity by bringing to your supervisor's attention what you believed in good faith to be improper conduct with regards to the owner/manager taking unauthorized tips, but in order for you to have strong ground to stand on in that sense, you would have to show that there was a policy widely understood at the workplace that what the owner/manager did was indeed unauthorized and improper.  What makes this argument problematic for you, however, is that the person you would complain of was a part owner of the business, and by default, business owners are entitled to the profits, unlike their employees.  This is a little nuanced, and of course I am splitting ### here, but these little distinctions can be very important when ascertaining whether you were engaging in a legally protected activity by acting as the whistleblower" in bringing this to the owners' attention.  My ### tells me that you would not win on these grounds but I simply do not know all the details of your employment enough to guarantee you an outcome based on the brief fact su###y you offered.  If you really really want to go forward with this I would meet with a local employment law attorney as soon as possible to at least explore the possibilities more closely than is possible online.  At the end of an initial consultation on this matter you would have the benefit of a candid legal opinion by legal counsel expert in employment law discrimination and retaliation.I hope this helps somewhat at least in terms of spotting the issues to be analyzed and more closely examined.  I hope that you can find someone locally who can talk this through with you.God bless you and your fiance and I wish you a long and happy married life.Best### A. ### ### Esq."43668.1819444444 Do I need to take action now as I was waiting on them for final reply. They called me and said the company doesnâ€™t owe you any ### while I have provided training to three new hires and has not been compensated 43730.8680555556 Good afternoon, Mr. or Mrs. ### (not sure the gender of ###, my apologies):I hope you are well.  I just saw this question on this website, despite it being around for some time, and I noticed that no one has answered you yet, so I thought I would offer a couple points.  I do not regularly practice employment law, but I have enough of a general knowledge to at least get you started.First, assuming you were an at-will employee at the time of your termination, it is very likely that the termination was legal, absent some compelling proof of illegal discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability or age (if over 40).  The mere fact that you were on the wrong side of your supervisor's ###, by itself, does not ### that you were discriminated against" in a legal sense (although I totally agree with you that the things you suffered at work were unfair and very unprofessional on your supervisor's part; I have had such supervisors in my past working life and it was not pleasant).  This is where a consultation with an employment law attorney would likely be very useful to you.  Many employment law attorneys will provide you a 30 ### ### initial consultation for either free or minimum cost; you just have to take a little time to search online and see which ones will do this for you.  Luckily there are scores of high-quality employment law attorneys in Wake ### and Orange Counties so do a little searching when you next have the opportunity.  You can use ### "Find a Lawyer" feature as well as make inquiries with the Wake County Bar Association and Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association.You will need to do this as quickly as possible since there is a ### deadline to sue following your obtaining a "Right to Sue" Letter and you will likely need a "Right to Sue" Letter after having your prospective case vetted by both legal counsel and U.S. EEOC.  Act on this by seeking a consultation as soon as possible.  Employment law attorneys will generally front the legal expenses of litigation if they agree to take your case.As to the pending investigation it may be that they are stalling for time or it may simply be typical bureaucratic slowness; it is hard to tell but fro###lawyer's point of view three months is not unreasonably long although I know that the employee never sees it that way.  Once you consult with legal counsel s/he will be able to advise you better than I can as to whether the long silence is typical or problematic.This is enough to at least get you started without you having to yet worry about expensive legal bills and costs.  I hope that your legal inquiries into this matter are productive.  Best wishes in your career situation finances and all other things you need to improve in order to achieve great progress in your life.  Have a blessed and productive fall.### A. ### ### Esq."43729.7951388889 Hello,I served a ### clinic for ###, NC last year to be able to make a living. I was promoted to Trainer position and was training new hires. The Manager was discriminating me giving me hard time, cutting my schedule hours, ###. she was not processing my training payment on time and ignoring my requests, I asked her to transfer to my another clinic but she did not. she was not helping with the work load as she was expected to do. I did my level best to be in good terms with her but futile. one day, I decided to resign with two weeks of notice and I specifically mentioned due to discrimination. because her  manager was not responsive too. I was left with no option but to resign. after my resignation during two weeks of notice period she was not talking to me at all and also took some retaliatory action such as issuing me a written warning for reportedly breaching some policies few months ago. If I breached the policy why I was not issued a warning at that time. After resigning I filed a complaint with compliance department where I brought all the issue under the attention of compliance department and I regularly am following it up. each time I ask for update they tell me the investigation is under process and we will notify you once finished. it has been over three months by now I am waiting their reply. but think they are just wasting my time as a discrimination issue on the basis of language and color should not last this long. I am financially not stable and still jobless and can not afford to hire a lawyer for the case. I was at the local library a week a go and I found about this free legal answer website. my question is specifically whether I should wait for them to finish investigation or there is a time frame beyond that I can not lodge a complaint. I am planning to sue the company. where can I start and what are the procedure to follow. I know nothing about the issue and really need a guidance in this regard. I have been discriminated, my hours were cut further when I trained my manager best friend, she was not processing my training payment on time, when I wanted to bring some issue to the attention of her manager. the manager also ignored me and did not meet me after several attempts messaging her. actually, I have no conflict with company because I was always treated with respect in other clinic I have served previously. my conflict is with facility administrator and her manager who was ignoring my request to see her for some issue. she was siding facility administrator and never saw me in person, while she was in clinic several times and meet with facility administrator. 43668.7215277778 I think your next best action is to set up a consultation with an employment law attorney this week, so that you can outline a detailed strategy now, with the benefit of a give-and-take conversation in person with an attorney with deep employment law expertise.  We can provide you with general guidance online, to help point you in the right direction, but specifics will likely not be as effective as needed unless you obtain these through personal discussion with the right attorney.

All the best.43730.8770833333 ###, Under the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act, you are owed and accrued but unused PTO time, as long as the PTO is not forfeited upon ### of employment.  The employer ideally would have a policy on whether PTO is paid out at the end of employment. Depending on the number of employees employed by your employer, you may also have recourse for the circumstances of your termination.  I recommend reviewing the NC Department of Labor Website, ### and the EEOC  Website to first gain a better understanding of your potential rights. ### You would have ###'s action to file an EEOC Charge.

Recieved the letter to only find out while reading it stating ### ### is no longer an employee".  Payroll Administrator  received information from an assistant of the Facility Administrator that I am not returning from medical leave. This information was incorrect.  The payroll administrator deleted me from all records.  All wages Paid time off or employment verification was wiped clean.  Continuing employment would have to restart as if a new hire. Further explanation was during any medical leave time all employees are to be discharged from the system.  I found this not to be true as ###  passed with my employment in an active status.  My question is Do I still have a rigt to claim my Paid time off wages because of this incompetence? What are my rights?"43674.8166666667 Hello, Ms. ###:I hope you have had a good summer despite the troubles at the salon.  You ask a very good question, and I have had quite a lot of experience with ### as a drafter of them for employers, and as an advocate against them for employees.  Having seen these situations from both sides of the equation, I can offer you a few general points.First, let me warn you that no lawyer can provide you a definite no or yes on this issue without having first read the entire contract.  Many lawyers, including myself, often review these documents for low fees.  You may or may not desire such a service, but in general terms, North Carolina courts do not like non-competes, which they view as an ### limitation on an employee's ability to earn a living and take full part in our system of ###.  North Carolina courts look very closely at the language of non-competes, to determine, principally, two things: (###) is the time period of limitation reasonable? and (###) is the geographical scope of limitation reasonable?  If the answer to both questions is yes, and there was consideration offered in exchange for the employee's signature on the agreement, courts will almost always uphold the agreement in question, despite the reservations that I above mentioned.In North Carolina, any geographical limitation up to 50, ### ### (depending on the nature of the business, and how far its market share for customers and vendors reaches), and a one-year limitation is almost always considered reasonable (it can sometimes be up to two ###, depending on the nature of the ### one year is typically the comfortable maximum for North Carolina judges).  So, while I admittedly have not see your agreement in its entirety, I tend to believe, based on the limited knowledge I have, that your non-compete agreement will be upheld as lawful and reasonable should you breach it, and your former employer decides to sue you to enforce the agreement.One final note on the subject of consideration.  Consideration is a ### upon exchange of promises or benefits, and it must be contemporaneous with whatever contract was formed, whether verbally or in written form.  If you signed the non-compete at the beginning of your employment, the employer may correctly state that it gave you consideration for your willingness to sign the non-compete.  If you were already employed, and the employer, as an afterthought, required you to sign the non-compete, but did not furnish additional consideration (in the form of a promotion, raise, bonus, tenure guarantee, or some other valuable ### likely to be attractive to the employee) in exchange for your willingness to sign the non-compete, you could correctly argue that the non-compete was not supported by consideration, and therefore is not enforceable.  This is known as the past consideration" rule which stands for the principle that "past consideration is not new consideration" when the terms of employment or any other contractual understanding have changed with new demands by either side.  This is my general overview for your educational purposes.  If you desire or need a more specific answer to your question contact a North Carolina contracts or employment law attorney for a brief (### ###?) consultation in which legal counsel can analyze your non-compete in detail.  Blessings and best wishes to you.Best### A. ### ### Esq."43689.9583333333 Hi, Iâ€™ve been at a salon for ###. Signed a non compete agreement canâ€™t work within ### ###. The new salon I want to go to is ###.###. I need to know if there is a way I can get out of the agreement. Please help me get out of this toxic situation (I tried to attach the pictures I took of the non compete agreement but I kept getting an error. Please let me know if there is another way I can send it) 43683.6145833333 Is it legal to wrongfully terminate someone without looking more into what happened?

Phone number is 1-800-###.43690.74375 Im a counselor and I agreed to work at a social ### group practice as an independent contractor. After signing a contract to work for her, I learned there were multiple problems with the practice owner and location of the practice. I additionally learned the practice owner was dishonest in her claims about providing me client referrals. I had viewed the office building and not seen any damage in or around my office, but later learned there was flooding in the ceiling, possible black mold, roaches, and damage to the office door that had not been repaired and allowed clients' confidential information to be heard from the waiting room. I additionally learned the client referrals the owner had promised to give me were not usable, as they were former clients of another counselor who had quit many months ago as well as clients who had called over five years ago and no longer needed services. Lastly, the practice owner was unable to provide me with an office key or signed contract in spite of many weeks of my attempting to obtain these items. Upon asking the owner to dissolve the contract of employment, she responded yes on the phone. The next day I received an email saying that i would need to pay her for an invoice of $###, emailing her, and meeting with her and another employee, where they primarily discussed changes they wanted to make to the practice and I did not receive training or any billable services. She also including consultation, supervision, and in session time as charges, none of which I actually received. We discussed our personal lives once and she gave me advice on an issue but it was not agreed that she was giving me a consult for a fee. I sent her an email a few days ago saying I was seeking outside consult to see if I had any liability. Upon telling her that she stated she was going to increase the charges I owe her to $### $### 50% discounted rate, but it no longer applied. The contract I signed with her says if I stop working for her in the first year $###. She did not set up my office and did not provide me training other than giving me a packet of intake paperwork for the practice so I could get familiar with their forms. Nothing else in the contract says anything about me owing her any money if I donâ€™t work for her.She has not yet filed a claim against me, but I am wanting to know what my liability is and what my rights are. Thanks ### Stack 43694.5451388889 Ms. Stack:Thank you for your question.  This is an interesting sequence of events.  It appears that this situation escalated once you informed the principal of your desire to terminate the contract, so in terms of legality, I think a lot of this simply blowing smoke in front of you to intimidate you.  Whether the amounts you owe truly total $###, $1,000, or some other relatively small sum, the principal would have to sue you in small claims court, and without hard evidence that you actually incurred such charges (such as invoices generated contemporaneously with the alleged conduct by you giving rise to the invoiced sums), it would be hard for the principal to persuade a small claims magistrate that you should pay a monetary judgment (that does not ### of course that this person would not try, necessarily, but only that it is not likely to succeed if there is not evidence that these invoices legitimately arose from your conduct, and are rooted in your independent contractor agreement, under specific provisions of that document).If you know of legitimate expenses that you owe the principal, I would pay them up to the termination date of your employment.  Otherwise, you should either hold firm in not paying what you do not legitimately owe, or you should consider paying a compromise amount, in exchange for a written waiver of all future claims against you that the principal might consider bringing against you, at any time within the applicable statute of limitations (three years), for anything arising from the independent contractor agreement and your employment with the principal.I think the key thing right now is complying with the termination clause in your agreement; make sure you follow this provision to the letter, with a specification of what exactly is the termination date (I am thinking of clauses viii and x, specifically).  Any ### of your intent to terminate should be in writing, and you should keep exact copies of every written thing you send, deliver, share or give to the principal.Right now, that is probably the best you can do.  We have no idea right now whether this person is serious about pursuing you legally.  Unfortunately that is sometimes a consequence of these contracts, but fortunately on the other hand, the sums of money in dispute are such that they are not really worth the principal expending resources of time, money, legal fees and headache to pursue you for so little.  That may, more than anything else, be the saving grace here.  But if both sides really want to be sure that this break is truly a clean break, a mutual waiver of liability and claims, in a compromise ###,  would be highly beneficial because it allows both sides to move on with a sense of finality, as well as peace of mind.  I would have a lawyer draft such a document for you if that is something in which you are interested, and if you believe it is something that possibly both sides could sign.  That would at least save you the possibility of a lawsuit, even if it is just a small claims matter.This is admittedly incomplete, but the best I can think of without really knowing the other person's state of mind, intentions or degree of reasonableness (or lack thereof).In any event, I hope that this stabilizes soon, and that you are able to move to a better opportunity as we move to the fall.  You obviously have much more to contribute to your community.  Blessings and best wishes to you and your family.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43697.0770833333 No problem.  Hope all goes well for you.  43698.6930555556 Thank you for your help. 43698.6909722222 Ms. ###:Thank you for posting in this forum.  I have had a couple disrespectful supervisors myself, and I know from experience that showing up to work each day where you know you will be disrespected can really ### the spirit.  I regret that you find yourself in this situation, which I am sure is undeserved.Unfortunately, the law will be of little efficacy to you in improving your situation.  Your boss is rude, disrespectful, and ###-spirited for sure, but these qualities in and of themselves, do not equal a hostile work environment" in a legal sense.  This refers to protected classes of people such as that based on race gender religion color national origin disability or age (if over 40).  To make the hostile work environment argument work you would need to show that your workplace was hostile to certain groups of people who are protected under federal or state law.  This is very different from one employee (or even a couple) being targeted just out of ### or insecurity.  Note that in addition to making people feel devalued and disrespected at work there also has to be an element of illegal discrimination as prohibited by statute.

On two separate occasions I have been out of work sick and she has taken handbooks, new employee paperwork, enrollment paperwork and pretty much everything I need to do my job. One week ago she called me and was talking ### accusing me of ganging up on her with another employee. Later that evening she text me to say she wouldnâ€™t need me at work the next day.

While I see nothing illegal about this (based on the limited information I have on which to make a judgment call), I do think it rather odd that your wife would have to pay someone to let her come work for them.  I suppose there is some legitimate reason for the $400.###, but it is strange indeed.  I have never had a work situation anything like this.You might inquire of your wife what specifically the $400.###.  I would also be wary of an arrangement like this when it is not reduced to writing.  It is too easy for an employer to simply forget" about the deposit and never pay it back.Odd but not necessarily illegal.  A lawyer would have to know more about this before saying anything further.  If you have other suspicions about this employer I recommend that your wife consult locally with an employment law attorney.  Many such attorneys offer either free or low-cost consultations for preliminary ### for ### ###.Best wishes to you and your wife this fall.  ### A. ### ### Esq."43707.1201388889 It is fairly common for these type of disability claims to take a long time to process.

Im just wondering what is the next steps i need to take 43713.7381944444 Ms. Fox:Thank you for this important question, and my regrets to you and your daughter for having to experience such an unpleasant experience.  As best I can tell from reading your factual su###y, the termination would have been legal since your daughter was all but certain to have been an at-will employee.  In an at-will employment context, either employee or employer can terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason (or for no reason formally stated), as long as there is no illegal discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or age (if over 40), or no violation of public policy under state or federal law.  I see no reason based on what you wrote here to believe, as a lawyer, that your daughter's termination was illegal, even if it was truly unfair (as it appears to be, based on what you described).As to the ### issue, that could be false imprisonment, depending on the facts, but at this point I cannot say so for sure.  If the employer believed in good faith that your daughter did something against the employer's interests that could have been illegal (even if they turned out to be wrong), they are entitled to investigate the situation and speak to your daughter in a closed environment, but only for a reasonable period of time.  If they actually held her against her will and interrogated her for more than a reasonable period of time necessary to confirm or refute their own suspicions, you could have a viable lawsuit against the employer for the civil tort claim of false imprisonment.  This would require a detailed conversation between a lawyer and your daughter, during which the lawyer would gather facts to ### with North Carolina common law precedent on false imprisonment.If exploring a false imprisonment lawsuit is of interest to you and your daughter, I would consult locally with a civil litigation lawyer who might be interested in taking this on.  You can find referrals using ### Find a Lawyer" feature as well as the ### County Bar and the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association.

There appear to be a few different issues you may be referring to in your email. First, if you are interested in a no-contact order" from your manager then it seems you are referring to a 50C. This is a protective order due to harassment and is a CIVIL matter. You can visit the local courthouse to file it. However it's not going to be easy to prove. I encourage you to think about why you do not want to sign the form. Arbitration clauses are common in employment contracts or agreements; however I am curious as to why the employer wants the form signed now and what issues you have with it.If you believe you are being discriminated against for race age nationality gender ethnicity etc. then you may want to consider contacting the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). If you have not been paid for hours that you have already worked then consider contacting the NC Department of Labor. Finally be aware that you may have signed forms with Human Resources that said you will resign documents or update pertinent information when requested. If so then your employer may have the right to request that you resign this form. I also want to point out that NC is a employment at will state which means that Taco ### can fire you for a good reason bad reason or no reason at all (except for discrimination as mentioned above).I hope this helps!"43739.6215277778 I work for a haunt that has a noncompete contract. Before signing, I was in management. I agreed to a bi weekly pay. It's the ### week. No pay. I also received nothing in return for signing the form. Is the contract legally binding?43722.3284722222 Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  Assuming that the ### substance was reasonable in both its geographical scope (anywhere from ### ###, otherwise, if the employer is a larger enterprise, the permitted scope could be greater than NC or even the Southeast) of prohibited activity and the length of time after your termination of employment (usually up to a year is enforceable), this comes down to whether you were offered consideration" contemporaneously with you signing the non-compete.This implicates the "past consideration" rule of contracts which ### the principle that past consideration to support a contract is not sufficient to constitute new additional consideration for modifications or addenda to the original agreement.  So if you were merely offered the chance not to be fired in exchange for your signing the non-compete and you were already an employee when you signed it the non-compete is likely not enforceable due to lack of consideration and the past consideration rule.  Otherwise if you were offered new employment or some other form of valuable consideration (such as a bonus raise promotion or some other incentive that would be reasonably attractive to an employee) in exchange for your signing the non-compete it would be enforceable against you (again assuming it was otherwise reasonable as to its substantive terms which I of course have not read).If you believe that you have solid grounds to challenge the enforceability of this non-compete based on either unreasonable terms or the past consideration rule you need to hire a lawyer to review the facts in greater detail than any of us can in this online forum and to have the lawyer you hire send a letter of warning to the employer not to try to sue you since the agreement is unenforceable.  I do not believe this service would be unreasonably expensive although fees would vary depending on the lawyer you retain for this matter.I hope this is helpful to you for your reflection.  I wish you the very best in whatever you decide to pursue.Have a safe and blessed fall### A. ### ### Esq."43722.8041666667 I work at a large hospital system.

I was given all the paperwork for my job ahead of time including my relocation paperwork. They refused to send me the tuition reimbursement papers and said I would have to pick them up after starting. Picked them up at orientation and filled out and turned in. They were then denied because in the paperwork there is one small phrase that says for your initial degree. I am not the only one that was deceived and lied to about this to recruit staff.

I am very sorry that you are having to deal with such i###ure and inconsiderate behavior by coworkers at your job.  Absent an affirmative, discriminatory act based on whatever bias your supervisor may have against you, there is little if anything you can do, legally speaking, at this point in time.  Your direct supervisor and those in the chain of co###d above your supervisor are the ones with legal authority over the coworkers who are behaving badly.  You should report these incidents to HR in order to create a paper trail in case it needs to be used later.  Also keep your own detailed, private record of events, just in case you need to share this with an employment law attorney later should something illegal or actionable take place regarding your employment.As for the coworker who falsely accused you of molestation, I would also report that to HR and your direct supervisor, and if this persists, you might consider hiring a local civil litigator to send the coworker a ### cease and desist letter (and possibly even copy not only you, but your supervisor and the HR official, depending on what your lawyer advises you).  The type of lawyer you would use in this instance would either be an employment law attorney, or a general civil litigator.

I work for ### Healthcare in ###, NC.  43724.7590277778 Mr. ###,I thank you for your response. It has helped me realize what I need to do next. God bless you and your family.Sincerely, ### ###43725.225 Good Evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for this very important question.  I read your question fact pattern and attachment carefully, and if I were to base my analysis only on what I have written from reviewing your message, I would say that this does not amount to discrimination.  If you are an at-will employee, you can be terminated at any time for any reason, or for no reason stated, in the vast majority of situations.  Exceptions to this general at-will rule include illegal discrimination (based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability or age if over 40), violation of public policy as defined by state or federal law (not applicable here, based on the information you provided), or retaliation against you for engaging in a legally protected activity.  If these did not apply, and you are an at-will employee, your termination is legal even if it is unfair.For this reason, the pretext of your position being terminated due to lack of funding really has no bearing on the legality or illegality of your termination, unless it was a false pretext for an illegally ### purpose.  If for some reason there is more to the story than can be shared in this format or forum, I strongly recommend that you consult in person with a local employment law attorney, in order to obtain a more narrowly tailored analysis in light of the additional ### you may have at your disposal.Many employment law attorneys offer ### ### initial consultations for free, or for relatively low cost.  You can find such practitioner's using ### Find a Lawyer" feature as well as the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association.  I hope this helps in some way.I am sy###hetic to the fact that many terminations in the workforce can be based on drama petty office ### or other factors that the terminated employee may not find to be fair or reasonable.  In many cases however the law notes a distinction between ### and illegality.  Each situation differs depending on specific facts in each instance.Whatever the future of this position with your employer I hope that you remain in good shape this fall with your critical financial and career needs met.  Best wishes to you this season.### A. ### ### Esq."43728.0180555556 My employed advised that I was being laid off due to a big grant not being renewed. However I was the only staff laid off. There was another full time staff member on the same grant and she was not laid off. When asked why I was the only one laid off she insisted that it was just because of the grant. The organization printed in a news article that all staff were being moved to other offices. Prior to the lay off I spoke up about not being paid. 43727.6597222222 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:A blessed October to you.  I do not think the termination was illegal or wrongful, although it appears to have been very, very unfair.  Generally, if you are an at-will employee, you can be fired at any time, for any reason (or for no reason stated), as long as there is no illegal discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability or age (if over 40).  Absent that, and any violation of public policy under state or federal law, the termination is legal.  (Note, however, that if you had a written contract that specifically protected you from of right" ### opposed to "for ### might have a viable breach of contract clai###ainst the employer although it would take an employment law attorney's precise review of that contract to confirm this one way or the other.)However even in the likely event that you were lawfully terminated you are definitely entitled to be paid for any actual work and time that you expended for your employer's benefit so depending on what response you get back from HR over the next week or so you may wish to consult briefly with an employment law attorney in your part of the state who can send a final demand for payment for any uncompensated time up to your termination or else the employer risks that you or legal counsel will file a complaint with the NC Department of Labor for unpaid ###.  That will likely light a fire under them to do the right thing.Consulting with a local employment law attorney would also have the benefit of getting a second more precise set of "legal eyes" over your issue.  Whereas I am reading a brief post on a website to ascertain whether wrongful termination took place the attorney with whom you consult in person or by phone would be more thoroughly familiar with the facts of your situation and will have the chance to discuss particular ### that are beyond the scope of NC Free Legal Answers.  While I believe that I have correctly answered the wrongful termination question based on the information provided to me I also acknowledge that an attorney who has spoken with you directly may see things in this aspect that I do not.### "Find a Lawyer" feature is a good (and free) search tool for you and you can also contact the Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association for western North Carolina employment law counsel.

As we both understand, this is an unusual situation for all ###, the community college HR office, and the owners of the affected cars.  In short, yes, you can be terminated for this.Unless your contract with the community college says otherwise, you are an at-will" employee and therefore can be terminated at any time and for any reason or for no reason stated as long as there is no illegal discrimination (based on race color national origin sex religion disability or age (if over 40) or violation of public policy under state or federal law.  Even if this incident had never happened the community college could have legally terminated you for no other reason than a change of mind assuming you were an at-will employee instead of a worker with protected ### a civil servant under the NC Human Resources Act or an employee with a guaranteed tenure in your employment contract.If you believe that your contract contradicts the at-will employment rule of common law please see a North Carolina employment law attorney as soon as possible to go over the facts and review the contract to better determine whether you have rights and remedies to enforce against the community college.I am sorry for such an unfortunate incident.

My goodness, this conduct is terrible.  While your supervisor is clearly a ### and ### person based on the facts you shared, I am not sure that all of his misdeeds toward you amount to actionable or illegal conduct in the employment law context.  However, it is a very good idea for you to consult at least once with a North Carolina employment law attorney, so that you can discuss the details of how you have been treated much more thoroughly than is appropriate here.  If your consultation discussion reveals anything for which the supervisor can be sued or terminated, I am sure your lawyer will let you know, and outline a course of action as to how to deal with this.  I hope something better for you will break soon, as no husband or employee should have to deal with such disrespect.God bless you this fall.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43740.8263888889 Thank you.

I would like to know what my legal options are.43742.8090277778 Mr. ###:Thank you for asking this serious, important question.  What you described here was essentially a solicitation to enter a conspiracy to abuse legal process.  I suggest your reporting this to the local law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over this matter (### County Sheriff if this happened outside of an incorporated town or city, otherwise the police department of such town or city).  If they believe they have sufficient facts for a criminal investigation, they will likely let you know.Be well, and enjoy your fall in on the coast.### A. ###, ###, Esq.43744.00625 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for this important question; I can e###hize with you, as I have had a couple rude and ### supervisors myself in my work past.  I am glad that you have an appointment with U.S. EEOC, and hope you will also seek an initial consultation with an employment law attorney, since these types of situations often ### on details and ### that commonly escape online exchanges, and also because employment law attorneys often offer free or low-cost consultations for ### ###.  That should be plenty of time by which to obtain a precise determination of whether any wrongful termination or retaliation claims exist.If I were to make a legal judgment solely based on reading your fact pattern, I would opine that no illegality was committed by your employer, however rude, inconsiderate or even dishonest it might have been (and which I do not at all doubt) in its treatment of you.  In order to sue based on retaliation, you must have engaged in a legally protected activity" that ### an employee from termination either under federal or state law.  Examples of legally protected activity sometimes include speaking with employers about legitimate concerns about workplace safety; testifying in a legal proceeding about the workplace; serving as a whistleblower against an employer's illegal or actionable conduct; or otherwise discussing or organizing between or among workplace colleagues to improve workplace conditions or raise collective ### with the employer.  This protection against retaliation tends but does not always tend toward protection of employees when they act in concert with other employees on legitimate workplace concerns.So in this instance asking questions about equipment by itself would not be legally protected activity although raising concerns about your safety when required to use certain equipment in your job would likely be a legally protected activity.  This is one of many instances in which lawyers split ### to try to gain advantage for their clients whether they are the employers or employees in these situations.  This is why discussing your situation in person with an employment law attorney is so important.  Only then can you be assured that you are getting the most precisely correct answer to your worthwhile concerns.I would search locally for employment law counsel who might help you in this instance.  ### "Find a Lawyer" search is a useful (and free) resource online and you can also call the ### County Bar and/or Lawyer Referral Service of the North Carolina Bar Association for possible referrals in this area and in your local vicinity.  Lastly keep in mind ### ### one of the best employment law experts in North Carolina whom I know.  ### is based in Concord which is not terribly far from you in ### County (although it could be a little bit of a drive still worth it) and if you reach out to him let him know that I personally recommended you to him.

I was not told why the equipment was being taken.  I was told to use another equipment that I have no knowledge of or training. Manager also called the police on me and tried to ban me from the store. This Manager demonstrated some harsh aggressive behavior as well as unethical practice.  After firing me, he then wanted me to go the office. He did not follow protocols in place before firing someone which is: he was suppose to call another member of management to meet him in the office and when that takes place, he is then to call me into the office.I was very scared, humiliated, and embarrassed of his demeanor and aggression. He lied to unemployment stating that I was being insubordinate because I did not go to the office. I tried to explain to the Unemployment division that that was not the case, that he had already unfairly fired me and why I didn't feel safe with him asking me to go to the office without the protocol in place. And then explained to them, If he had followed the right procedures, I would have gone to the office because I would not have known why I was being called to the office and furthermore, I would have not been subjected to his harsh behavior.  The Assistant manager continued to lie about various things, even assaulting him knowing two officers where there with us. I never argued with him. I never assaulted him. I never was angry.  I was hurt, confused, embarrassed, scared,  and humiliated. I have witness who will testify to my behavior.43746.8951388889 Good evening, ###:Thank you for your question.  You raise good issues here.  If the devices you carry with you are capable of picking up on sound, there would indeed be a legal issue here; at minimum, this could constitute intrusion upon ### civil offense in North ### is defined as (###) the placing of a person or thing in a private space (###) where there is a subjective expectation of privacy (###) and also an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy (###) the violation of which would be "highly offensive to a reasonable person."  I am not enough of a criminal lawyer to know whether there are criminal implications but yes this could be a huge civil liability issue for the hospital if this requirement stands.  I would report this to the hospital's HR and/or legal counsel department for a more close legal analysis.  I do not consider myself a privacy law expert but I definitely believe that you have raised some very important and understandable concerns.Have a productive fall in ### County.### A. ### ### Esq."43753.9583333333 I am currently a police dispatcher for the state of North Carolina at a hospital. We are in the process of moving to a new facility. In this new facility we have been told that we will have to take a police radio, ###, and head set with us to use the bathroom, which is also a public bathroom. My question is, Does this not affect my privacy legally?43753.6430555556 You can email me later at ### if needed, but I think this is more of an administrative thing to work out, as opposed to a lawsuit or an adverse legal action.  If your company's inhouse lawyers advise the senior management that this is legal, probably not much can be done.  I would also warn the ### folks that this could possibly run afoul of state and federal wiretapping laws as ### sound is captured by the devices.  Best wishes, again.43754.0076388889 would you take my case if needed? I have a picture of the list for us on my phone that says device for bathroom breaks.43754.0013888889 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for this question, and I hope that, except for this incident, your fall has commenced well in Halifax County.  The answer to your question depends on how seriously and conscientiously the employer responded to the problem when the people in charge became aware of it, and also whether the root cause stemmed from the employer, or some party distinct from the employer.  Assuming, for example, that the employer does not own or control the building's systems as a whole, and the employer made reasonable efforts upon becoming aware of this problem to fix it, it is more likely than not that the employer, at least at this point in time, will not be liable.However, since this injury happened at work, I seriously recommend that you find a local workers compensation lawyer and consult for an hour on this issue.  Even if your employer is not liable under normal principles of negligence law, it is still possible that you could gain compensation under the North Carolina Workers Compensation Act.  Feel free to consult locally in Halifax County if you know lawyers in that vicinity who are reputable in this field, but I also would like to recommend ### ### of ###, who is an expert of over ###.  If there is anyone who can tell you if you have a case, I am sure that ### ### could correctly analyze this ### get you results, if needed.  If for some reason ### believed that proceeding as a normal personal injury case would be better, his fir###so has younger lawyers who take on these types of matters, so from both a workers compensation and personal injury/negligence perspective, ###'s firm could be of service to ### if just for the assurance that you are getting competent, sound legal advice about whether you have a case.  See the below link to the law firm information:###/When you reach out to them, let them know that ### ### strongly recommended the firm to you.  I hope you will soon obtain the clarity you need on how to proceed in this matter.Best wishes to you,### A. ###, ###, Esq.43754.9944444444 I've been sick off and on because my job had water in the ### air line . My supervisor knew it was in it because i showed her the blow off one day. They had someone come in and supposedly fixed the problem but it was still happening. I went to the hospital recently because i had been sick so long and they said i had a upper ### infection. It was getting better until yesterday when i had to use the ### air again and my symptoms came back which lead me to believe it was the cause. My co worker had the same symptoms after using it also. I went to my supervisor and told her i believe it made me sick, she had maintenance to come change the filters. He told her it wouldn't help because it was too much water in the air line. I have a picture and a sample of the liquid that was blowing off to take with me to my doctors appointment. Im refusing to use the ### air again and wanted to know if i had cause for a lawsuit. 43754.9340277778 Good morning, ###:Thank you for this important question.  I strongly recommend that you see a Cumberland County employment law attorney and request an initial consultation on this matter.  What you describe sounds suspiciously like retaliation.  An attorney who regularly sues employers based on retaliation would need to speak with you in person or by phone to get a more specific grasp of the details of what happened and why.  I think that what you describe here is serious enough that it is worth your time to consult more directly.  You may very well have a case here.  Many employment law attorneys offer ### ### consultations for free or for low cost, so I think this is a win all around to consult with local counsel.I wish you a productive legal inquiry into this matter.43760.6388888889 I informed the owner of the company about illegal activities going on in the office, and that the manager came in to the office put her hands on me so she tried to fire me via text. After I told her I need to be fired properly and for a reason she decided to cut my hours and wages . Can I sue them? 43760.6284722222         I'm a contractor and hold contracts with four major internet, and phone companies .  iI just started and I'm trying to get off disability because we are ### eating out of food banks .

Sincerely ### ###43761.1527777778 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I think your best bet is to find an employment law attorney in ###, Hickory, ### or ###, and request a ### ### consultation to discuss.  Many employment law attorneys offer initial consultations of these lengths either for free or for relatively low cost, so I think it would be worth your time (and money, if applicable) to sit down with an expert in this field and go over these details a little more carefully.  I regularly advise my corporation clients on employment law-related matters, and while I do not consider myself an employment law attorney per se, I see nothing so far in the four lines you have written that would constitute wrongful termination, discrimination or unlawful retaliation (although it does appear that you work for rude and inconsiderate people, which is a problem I have faced in previous jobs).  I understand, however, that it is hard to put an entire history of working for an employer in just a few lines in a post, so it is possible that material factors exist of which I am not aware despite reading your fact summary.  The law of NC is heavily tilted towards employers over employees, so assuming no illegal action took place on your supervisor's part (such as discrimination or retaliation), it will be difficult to make a good case against the employer, even when the employer is being difficult or unfair.Please consult further with employment law counsel anyway, just to be sure in case you need to soon file a claim with the U.S. EEOC.  I hope that in-person discussion will yield additional insight into your situation.  Whatever happens here, I hope that this situation will improve and that your career prospects will not be ### by the present difficulties.Have a blessed and productive fall.43762.1104166667 Have my write ups. One is attendance and there's days I shouldn't have been on there. They was writing me up for a no show no call, but I turned in a two week notice. Wouldn't let me file ###. When I found out that a case of ### caused a cyst on my foot. I was told I better not go over senior director head about the no call no show. So I called the president of our sector.43762.0868055556 Good evening to you, Ms. Marble:Thank you for your question.  This is a very unfortunate situation, and of course no one likes to deal with an unfair or ### supervisor.  Unfortunately, however, based on the facts you have stated here, there is no grounds for a successful lawsuit for wrongful ###ination, or a similarly situated tort, such as retaliation.  This situation basically comes down to your supervisor's de###ination to play favorites, and to dislike you no matter how hard you worked, or how calm and professional you remained (as I am sure you did) under pressure.  Mere ### or ### is not actionable and cannot be sued upon successfully.  Here, the at-will employment rule ###, your employer can fire you at any time, for any reason, or for no ### you did not have a written employment contract for a set ###, and assuming there was no illegal discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability or age (if over 40).  Absent illegal discrimination or illegal retaliation (against a legally protected activity, such as serving as a whistleblower, or objecting to unsafe working conditions, to cite two common examples), any ###ination your employer elects is legal, even if it is unfair.I wish I could offer better news, but that is the state of North Carolina and federal law as it relates to your situation.  Having been mistreated myself by a rude supervisor in the past, I totally relate to how you feel, but also wish to be candid as to what the law says about these types of situations.  I hope you can soon find gainful employment elsewhere, where you are treated with the respect and courtesy that you no doubt deserve.Blessings and best wishes to you this fall and winter.43767.1576388889 I began working at ### ### ###, within a week I was promoted to Assistant manager.  A month in I was demoted back to server due to owner stating she didnâ€™t â€œlikeâ€ me. During the months of July-September I remained server.  Last week of September I was asked to manage store and transfer to other location.  After ###.  ### disgruntled employee caused argument and scene over server rotation.  Employee threatened to fight myself and another employee.  The employee left premises and came back with others.  That employee was terminated the morning of 10/###. The explanation about termination on my part was to eliminate the other employee from coming back to retaliate and would be bad for the business if I remain employed.  Causing a great deal of emotional distress and lack of ability to pay bills.  Cameras in store show that I remained calm during the entire incident on ###.  Due to owner not liking me, was reason I was terminated, my name being mentioned in the situation was ammo to say I can no longer work. 43767.1458333333 Good morning, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  You raise a very good question about employee handbooks.  The law has consistently been held to not imply a reasonable inference on the employee's part that a handbook is part of a contract.  I do not think the employee would get very far on such a theory in court, given that the employer almost always wins when this is the argument in a lawsuit.  Where this can be relevant, however, is if the employer is inconsistent in how it applies the provisions of the handbook towards different employees: for example, the employer strictly applies rules about showing up on time with employees of color, but does not apply the rule at all, or does so with great leniency, with respect to white male employees.  In that situation, any adverse actions towards the employees of color might be highly relevant to the court in terms of ascertaining whether illegal discrimination based on race is taking place (and the same for color, national origin, religion, sex, disability or age if over 40).  All that to say, the handbook will not be construed as part of a contract unless your written employment contract says so, but it could still be relevant in the court's analysis if other factors in your workplace indicate illegal discrimination, retaliation or other violation of public policy is taking place due to your employer's actions.  It really depends on all the factors at play.I recommend an initial consultation of ### ###, who can vet the facts of this situation in greater detail, and provide you with a much closer analysis than can be provided in this online forum.  You have plenty of excellent choices in the Raleigh-### area.  Use ### Find a Lawyer" feature in addition to contacting the Wake County Bar ### County Bar and/or Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association.  Many employment law attorneys will provide initial consultations either for free or for low-cost.Best wishes to you this winter and have a blessed Thanksgiving when it comes later this month."43775.6902777778 Hi. My question is if an employer does not have the following within a handbooklanguage that explicitly state that a handbook is not a contract,has no language written within it creating a disclaimer such as this example what is written in here does not revoke employers right to (so on and so on)" or something to that affectuses it to train employees on policiesuses the handbook to hold employees accountable for perceived rule upholding (as a sign of employee following policy)Uses it's very wording to justify disciplinary action against an employee especially in written reprimands against an employeeLegally is it possible an employee could be said to have reasonably believed it to be a contract  between an employee and an employer based on the above even if an employer claims it is not binding against the employer?Thanks."43775.6534722222 Thank you for that answer. I am in this situation and have been wondering about it since a section of my employee handbook was used to justify a write-up, quoting it word for word but a conflicting policy on that section, which contradicts it and is not in the handbook is being used to justify refusal to retire. Both are claimed to be the company's ruling on attendance policy but contradict each other on a major point: handbook explicitly states that ### absences are grounds for disciplinary actions. Excused absences do not come with disciplinary actions. However excused absences were verbally stated to me by another manager recently to count against employees in a negative way ( handbook does not state this, neither did manager in the write-up), and what that policy states contradicts the attendance policy in their handbook. Yet this verbal policy is being used to justify denial of rehire, even though this policy was not given to me until after I disputed their actions since the basis of denial appears to be employment discrimination. My thoughts are to proceed to getting legal counsel and possibly file an employment discrimination lawsuit. I needed to get legal advice about the handbook first before I proceeded with other information I had to prove I was being denied a job I did meet qualifications for on false grounds. Thanks for your help.43775.7125 Thank you very much for your help. 43775.7402777778 Wow.  This is even more factually complex than I originally thought when I read your first post.  Thanks so much for filling me in with greater detail.  I definitely urge you to consult with an employment law attorney as soon as possible, as this is serious enough to warrant a more full discussion with counsel than is possible on a website like this.  Since you are in Wake County and I am in ###, I know of a few possibilities you should seriously consider.  Feel free to reach out to whomever you wish, but for the present moment, I would recommend ### ### of ### (see link below):https://jordanprice.com/attorney/daniel-###/You can also look at my friend ### ### of ### (see link below):https://www.kornbluthginsberg.com/about-us/###-###/Let either one or both know that their friend and colleague, ### A. ###, referred you to them with high recommendation.  I am sure that ### and/or ### can guide you in the proper direction.I really hope something can be done here to promote your fortunes and provide you with greater ###, financially and otherwise.  I will be thinking of you this winter, and I wish you all the best.43775.7347222222 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  At minimum, you are entitled to some compensation for your labor up to today (###), although at what ### is not entirely clear; if there was an agreement at your ### meeting as to the terms you proposed (and wh###h I assume ### accepted), then that agreement would set out what you should be paid for all that you have done up to today.  This would also apply to any obligations that were binding on you per the agreement, whatever terms were agreed upon, even if verbally.### has the right to terminate your serv###es since you were either an independent contractor or an at-will employee (you need to clarify this so that she can file the proper paperwork for tax purposes; it sounds to me like you were an ###, and if that is correct, by ### ### should file a ### (confirm with a CPA or whoever does your taxes for you, just to be sure).  If in exchange for payment ### wants to add other things for you to agree on that were not agreed on back on ###, that is up to you two to negotiate, but I would say that (###) you should reduce your understandings to a signed writing (preferably one designed by legal counsel), and (###) regardless of whether you agree to new terms about the PLLC owning certain rights to your work, you are still entitled to be paid for your work since this summer, per the ### agreement.  If ### withholds payment from you because she cannot get you to agree to new terms never before discussed, she is being unjustly enr###hed, and you would have grounds for a viable lawsuit, or possibly a complaint to the NC Department of Labor for unpaid wages.Ideally, there would have been a written agreement long before now, but since that appears to not be the case, I would try to negotiate something fair and reasonable (in writing) this time around.I wish you the best in obtaining a fair outcome without undue burden, hassle or expense.  Have a blessed winter and Thanksgiving in ### County.43780.1416666667 I was asked by a former co-worker named ### to work for her in helping start a new business. A friend of mine named ### was the only other person that she was employing in this enterprise. I was not offered a specific salary or pay schedule, but simply told that I would be compensated. ### was to be a service provider in this business (a boutique spa), and I was asked to work on branding and operations. I started working ###st (out of my home) and designed a logo for the company. From ###st until today (###), I have worked independently & collaboratively, attended meetings and maintained email correspondence and text conversations with ### and ###. On ###, I had a meeting with ### and we discussed compensation. I explained that I am on disability and am limited in the amount of work I can do and money I can earn. I showed her a preliminary revenue projection spreadsheet I had made for the business and a suggested salary plan based on it starting at $###. ### remarked that it wasnâ€™t very much money, and I said I didnâ€™t want to take a lot out of the business in the early stages and was happy with the work I was doing. I also stated that I could go without being paid for awhile but that I did have to choose between spending the finite amount of energy I had to either work for her or continue the delivery work I had previously been ### I couldnâ€™t do both. I stated that without any income from work I wasnâ€™t sure if I could wait until September to be paid.I continued to work consistently and to communicate my work to ###. On ### ### sent a text requesting that ### and I email her our respective expectations regarding duties, hours, pay. I sent the requested information on ###, and at a meeting on ### ### said she had received and read it, that it was fine, and asked me if I could wait until â€œwe opened our doors.â€### serviced the first client on ###. I continued to work and produce ### product. We had our last meeting ###th during which I presented printed examples of the business cards, menu and business forms I had designed for review and discussion. I continued to exchange email with ### regarding various revisions through this morning, and this evening I received an email stating that she canâ€™t afford to have me continue to do work stating, I will also like to compensate you for the work that you have done so far with the understanding that the amount we agree on is reasonable and you agree to release in writing that all art work (including high definition images) that you have done for me is the property of ### ### PLLC."I need to know her legal obligations and my rights. Thanks!"43780.1201388889 Mr. ###:Very helpful follow up.  My answer does not substantially change, although there is a shred of nuance here about whether it's fine" was a hard acceptance of your August proposal of terms or merely an agreement to keep talking "until the doors open."  I would argue from a lawyer's point of view that you and ### made a legally enforceable agreement as to (###) the scope of your duties for ###'s PLLC and (###) your compensation.  You did NOT come to an agreement about intellectual property rights so that legal issue remains outstanding.If you are okay with signing away the intellectual property rights in exchange for the $### and you can reduce that to a professional ### writing I think you will be in good shape.  The potential problems could arise if you or ### wants to impose new terms not previously agreed to in August and that creates ### that encourages ### not to pay you.  At that point you would have to contemplate a small claims suit or a NC DOL complaint.  Hopefully you can work this out amicably especially since you do not appear to be bothered about the intellectual property angle.  As long as both sides are ### and reasonable about this this situation is probably fixable as to both sides; try to emphasize to ### that you are trying to achieve a ### for you two.I hope everything turns out okay for both you."43780.71875 Thank you. I'm very grateful for your advice. I see that I should have edited my question to fit in the following, which might have been helpful to know:The proposal I submitted by email on ### was comprised of list of responsibilities I was prepared to handle and an offer to work as much as needed on a monthly contract basis for a flat rate of $###. I did not make any reference to intellectual property at all. When ### said she had reviewed my proposal, that it was fine, and asked me if I could wait until â€œwe opened our doors, ### was in the room but I donâ€™t know if she was paying attention or would remember and I have no other proof that ### did in fact agree to my proposal. I do have her reply email dated ### in which she says "Thanks for your email.  I will review and we can discuss tomorrow." I think a reasonable amount would be $### for which I would also be willing to sign transfer ownership of all of the intellectual property I created. I haven't any idea if I should just go ahead and make that offer or if it would be wiser to ask her what she would consider to be a reasonable amount first. Again thank you for your advice. I understand if you haven't the time for a reply. "43780.6423611111 Good afternoon, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  Having read over this posting a couple times and thought over your situation, I have to conclude that, at least based on what you have written here, there is nothing to support any defamation action or wrongful ### work environment claim.  It appears that you were terminated unfairly based on either rumor, ### or misunderstanding, but all of these are legal so long as race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability or age (if over ###0).  Absent that, you can be fired in North Carolina for any reason, or for no reason stated by the employer.  Even if you did not quit or put in any kind of notice or threat to quit, the employer may still terminate you absent illegal discrimination or other prohibited activity, such as ### you for engaging in legally protected conduct (not at issue here).Falsely saying you quit is unfortunate and unfair, but does not constitute defamation" in a legal sense.  Defamation requires four distinct crucial elements: (###) a concrete statement of fact (###) of and concerning the plaintiff (###) written or spoken to a third party (###) that damages the plaintiff's ### in the community and/or causes the plaintiff economic loss.  Please note that defamation lawsuits are both hard to win and very expensive to pursue (with most lawyers requiring at least $5### as most lawyers do not pursue defamation cases on pure contingency bases).I realize that this is not an altogether satisfying answer to your question but it is an honest one based on examining all that you wrote in your fact summary.  If the situation is more factually complex than it appears from this posting please feel free to consult with a local employment law attorney in your area and discuss this more thoroughly.  Many excellent attorneys in this area will offer you a free or low-cost consultation for ### ###.  I wish you the very best this winter including your Thanksgiving holiday this month.Be well."43783.9263888889 I did not quit. I did not put in a ###. My actions have not inferred quiting.

I losing badly needed income. Who is liable from the information that I have given? 43783.86875 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Honestly, none of us on this website can tell you for certain whether you have any remaining viable remedies in light of the EEOC letter you received, since the complexities of this situation go beyond that for which this website was designed.  Having participated in this forum for two years now as a volunteer attorney, I can tell you that while this website is very helpful for brief legal advice and general legal information, it is inadequate for such a situation as yours, in which there are so many players, and commensurate moving parts.  The only way to obtain the best and most accurate legal answers to the serious, worthwhile questions you have raised, is to have a consultation with an experienced employment law attorney.  Many employment law attorneys offer ### ### consultations either for free or for relatively low cost, and after such discussion with counsel in person, you would have a very solid idea of whether you should proceed legally despite the EEOC's objection based on timeliness.I recommend using ### Find a Lawyer" feature to search for employment law attorneys in and near ### County.  Please also reach out to the Wake County Bar and Lawyer Referral Service of the NC Bar Association for further possibilities.I hope you find someone with whom you can talk things through in person in order to be sure that you are getting correct legal advice.  Wrongful termination claims involving FMLA can be very tricky affairs based on what I have seen from my prior experience representing a client who requested FMLA leave based on a mental ### disability.  There is some wiggle room for employers to terminate persons who are on FMLA leave or who have requested FMLA status if they can show that the termination was unconnected with FMLA status or requests and that it was based purely on the person's ability to competently fulfill prescribed work duties.  These situations are always highly disputed between employers and employees and whether the employer can prevail depends in part on how well they documented their internal ### before terminating the employee and what such documentation reveals.  It really does require discussion with employment law counsel to get this right.The sexual harassment issue should also be discussed with the attorney although that aspect of your question is much more clear cut in nature.  If I were basing my analysis purely on what you have written and attached here I would say that this is serious grounds for a claim based on sex discrimination.  Hopefully employment law counsel can add further clarity on that matter also.This is a serious situation that you should explore further in detail.  I think you might have something promising.Blessings and best wishes to you this winter and in ###."43806.0270833333 I have been wrongfully terminated based on my disability while on protected medical leave given the reason: As previously indicated you were let go because you were unable to return to work within the prescribed time period."

What do I do?43815.7805555556 Good evening, ###:Thank you for your question.  The supporting fact summary here is a little hard to follow, but you would have the right to pursue a lawsuit if you have not been paid for ### you furnished at a property owner's residence.  Assuming you are a workman or ### of some kind, you would need to first file a Claim of Lien against the property within ### (the ### time limit) of the last furnishing of labor or materials at the residence, and would then have to file your lawsuit to enforce the lien no later than ### (the ### time limit) after the last day you either worked on the property or furnished materials.

They getting jobs from others ( Companies or individuals) and we follow orders like a punch list. We do remodel the houses. They werenâ€™t familiar with this industry so I was there to support them to run the business. I see there wasnâ€™t business discipline Or very poor. so I pushed to have a contract. So fortunately I have formal contract. They didnâ€™t pay money for all the jobs that I did and Blame all the time there is a reason which they can not pay and they never followed the agreement. After a while I being sure  that they donâ€™t want to pay me for all the jobs that I did. I lived with loan money that I had but I am in vulnerable situation. This is about a few properties that I done. I have special situation that I overqualified for companies to be hired In some positions and not qualified to fit in some other position this is why I had to work even if itâ€™s not professional offer. Since the company that I worked laid off I had been unemployed until I worked for them. I am not general contractor yet but I am aware of construction documents. They think because I am not aware of the laws so I can not get my money. This is sad fact when someone unsupportive they would get advantage and use them as they can. But I had patient because they are family with little children but I see they donâ€™t understand kindness and count it as my weakness. Right now helpless and close to lost everything. I believe I have all documents that a lawyer needed to win the case. Maybe if they see I have lawyer they would pay m without going to court. Because they know I donâ€™t have anyone and a refugee alone and they think possibly I donâ€™t know rules. My question is what documents would be great fit to prove my right?

Your employer can decide for what substances one tests positive for in order to be fired, and which ones will not lead to termination.  The employer has no duty to act in the same way that law enforcement has, and in fact, both have broad discretion when it comes to policing use of substances.  Just as the authorities do not necessarily arrest every single person in a city whom they know is engaging in illegal activities, so do employers have the right not to fire people for some forms of substance use, but not others.  The employer could even decide not to fire an employee for any substance abuse, so long as it does not affect the employee's work performance, or cause safety and wellness issues at the workplace. I appreciate your question, but it really boils down to one ###: employer discretion.I hope ###.

I think your ### are right in some of these instances that perhaps your age came into play, but at least based on what I have read here, I do not think these facts alone would be sufficient to support viable legal action based on age discrimination.  There could be more to this than appears in an online exchange such as the one here, but more factual context would be needed in a consultation with an employment law attorney (some of whom would probably offer you a free or low cost initial consultation for ### ###).If the people who were eventually hired for the positions for which you interviewed were ### unqualified or less qualified on paper than you are, that would tend to strengthen your argument that, all in all, you were discriminated against because you are over 40 (the age threshold for age discrimination claims).  If there is ### to establish that they were equally or better qualified, age may have been a factor in the overall deliberation and selection, but may not have been the ### factor.  What your ### evidence must show is that age was THE factor, not simply A factor.I of course acknowledge that one can be only so certain about a person's chances of success or failure when reading ### on a website, without the benefit of actually ### a person in an initial consultation, but I do think that your situation as presented here is credible enough to warrant at least one consultation with an employment law ### person or by phone.  You appear by all accounts to be an intelligent, ### and desirable employee to a wide array of potential employers, so given the number of times you made it to the ### round only to not get the job, I think it well worth your time to have an employment law attorney give this a closer look than is possible on this website (for all its strengths and beneficial uses).

But it is also the perfect excuse to give to avoid an accusation of age discrimination!I know it is hard to pin down age discrimination especially during the application process. I just would like to know how much proof is needed or even how widespread actual cases of age discrimination are in your experience. Particularly in the field of health and human services I would have thought it would not be as prevalent."43835.8340277778 Hi.  I suggest that you hang in there.  If you have any potential legal claims, a resignation may cause you to lose them.  If you believe you have been discriminated against due to your age, race, gender, ethnic origin, disability, or some other protected classification, you can go to the EEOC.  Similarly, if you have not been paid all wages or made a protected complaint about illegal activity or unlawful harassment, you may have various other legal claims.  If your employment is terminated and it is not for misconduct or some reason attributable to you, you will likely be eligible to collect unemployment benefits, but you will not be eligible if you resign. 43845.7284722222 I am a provisionally licensed clinical social worker and am pretty sure I am going to be terminated ###. I have been employed since ### and am still on my probationary period without benefits or PTO. My supervisor does not like me or feel I am a good fit for my position and makes my life miserable but somehow I am still employed. I met with her supervisors but that was not helpful. They were not sympathetic nor did they offer me any insight or help. The maximum company probationary period before termination is ###. I don't want to work there but I don't have an alternative right now and my family is low income. I would like to collect unemployment as a safety net while I find a better job. If that isn't feasible I would like to resign but I'm not sure what the best option is. My supervisor believes I do not have the clinical skills to be a psychotherapist and have not been adequately developing them, at least for the populations we work with at the company. I don't want to have to explain to future employers why I was fired unless I can be financially compensated. My family and I are barely making ends meet. I'm not  sure what to do and time is running out. Please advise. Thank you. 43845.1645833333 I do want to mention that you only have ###.  You can find your local office by going to eeoc.gov.

I also divulged a disability which I realized may have been affecting my work but they said that it has nothing to so with my performance. I have ADHD and I believe it is directly related to my performance. I'm not sure what to do because everytime I  think things can't get worse, they do. I'm having trouble functioning and now I'm concerned they are not going to terminate me but make it so I have to quit somehow.

If you exhausted your FMLA leave, you could request additional leave time as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The nearest EEOC office can be located through eeoc.gov.  Keep in mind that you have only ###. 43845.8125 I filed with the EEOC. They could not determine if a discrimination statue has been violated or not. They could not certify that the co. did not discriminate against me. They believied me but since only two people were in the office when this violation took place its up to me to prove discrimination and given the chance I can.

I was told to find a job and my boss said  I don't know why they hired someone my age to walk up all the stairs."43847.7020833333 It is very difficult to prove age discrimination today and its getting more and more difficult.  You practically need to get the offensive language o a recording.  Also, I'm not sure what actual damages you can show. Meaning loss of pay, extra doctor's visits because of emotional stress or whatever.  Without sufficient direct damages the extra/punitive money is hard to claim.  But I want to make it clear, what happened to you was terrible, immoral and uncalled for, and probably illegal.  however, it is very hard to definitively prove your case given recent decisions and the current political climate in NC, is not worth the hassle or the resources to pursue. I'm sorry I do not have better news.    43852.6958333333 A couple of weeks ago, I applied to a company called ### ###.

"43850.7138888889 Hi Mr. ###.   There are several issues to consider here.  First, did the prospective employer, ### ###, get written authorization from you to obtain a consumer report?  The potential employer is not responsible for what is contained in the criminal background check, but is required to obtain your permission before obtaining this information.  Second, check the report that you received to see if it contains any errors that may have led to the wrong criminal background information being reported, like ### of your name, wrong social security number, etc. that could lead to mistaken identity.  If the employer or the third party agency made a mistake with this type of information, they are required to correct it.  You should contact the third party association directly to correct any erroneous information and you may have to contact a law enforcement agency or a court directly to correct any false criminal information.    If you can provide proof that the information is incorrect (like a credible and current background check), contact the third party agency and the potential employer with the correct information, and requesting that this error be corrected.  After this, if the issue is not resolved, you may reach out to an employment law attorney.  You can use the NC Lawyer Referral Service to find an attorney.  More information can be found here:  https://www.ncbar.org/public-resources/lawyer-referral-service/        I recommend contacting the third party agency (and possibly the potential employer) first to determine if any errors were made with mistaken identity and go from there.    43852.7333333333 Hello, I filed a claim w/the DOL last year, they found in my favor and the business has refused to pay/missed the deadline to pay (###th).

"43853.9534722222 Good evening Ms. Bonaparte,To know for sure what your options are, an attorney will need to review your complete criminal history to see how this charge and any others are recorded. In North Carolina, once a charge is issued in a criminal case, a record of that charge will exist unless and until it is expunged. This is true whether the charge ends in a conviction, a dismissal, a finding of not guilty, or any other outcome. There are two main categories of expunction relief available in North Carolina: expunctions (also known as expungements) for convictions and expunctions for charges not resulting in a conviction. A charge not resulting in a conviction is any outcome where there was not a finding of guilt or responsibility. This includes both dismissals and findings of not guilty by the court. The first thing you will need to do is determine whether the charge on your record was a conviction or not. Expunctions for convictions are far more limited than expunctions for ###. If it is NOT a conviction and you do not have any felony convictions on your record, you are likely eligible to expunge the charge under NC General Statute ###. If it is a conviction, a much more thorough review of your complete record is required before any eligibility can be determined.I would suggest that you reach out to Legal Aid of North Carolina to request  free legal assistance in this matter. You can call their intake line at ### or apply online here: ###43874.0097222222 I tried for a job did a back ground check said I had something on my record about my daughter in ### ### ###43854.8375 Hello, I am hoping you can be of assistance.

I have been consulting for them since May of ###, my past payments have never been an issue. But now these last ###. The total is roughly ###, ###.###. I tried to ask the NC and FL wage and labor bureau, but they said to contact a pro bono attorney since my income is roughly 60/hr.  When the first invoice wasnâ€™t paid, I figured okay its holidays it can happen, they were still assigning me work and I was completing it. But when I questioned my invoice when submitting the second one, they claimed to say that they do not wish to pay me.  Main reason, they think my results were inaccurate, upon conclusion it was their method that was inaccurate. I was performing it correctly, but their window finding was set to .### .50. They had initially stated if I wasnâ€™t at fault (which I am not) they would pay me but now they are going back on their word.  This is the first time that this has happened to me. I am hoping that someone can help me out. I am only doing this so this company knows they cannot do this to other people and that is unethical of them. I provided a service and now they are not paying.  On top of that they stopped assigning me work and claimed to fire me without notice or anything. I have emails of the findings of the method error, and I have texts of them assigning me work and not mentioning anything. Also texts that if it was method error that they would pay me, but not abiding by their word. Hopefully someone can guide me in the right direction.Appreciate the time.Sidra ######-###43857.8333333333 Good afternoon, and Happy New Year to you, Ms. Hall:Thank you for this important question.  First, let me express my sympathy for the horrible way in which you were treated; this reminds me of one of my own terrible supervisors I had over ten years ago, and so I can relate to how you feel right now.The less than palatable news, however, is that this termination is entirely legal.  Assuming you were an at-will employee, you can be terminated at any time for any reason, or no reason stated.  The law makes a clear distinction from employers who are rude and disrespectful towards you, and those who actually engage in illegal behaviors, such as discrimination (i.e., based on race, color, national original, sex, religion, disability or age if over 40), or retaliation for engaging in legally protected activities (such as acting as a whistleblower, or organizing with fellow employees to improve working conditions).  Absent illegality, an employer can be less than honorable in his/her treatment of a subordinate, and still not run afoul of federal and state employment law.  Unfortunately, that appears to have been the case in your termination.If you think I have missed anything important, please feel free to seek a second opinion by consulting with a local employment law attorney, who can discuss the details of your situation far more so than is possible or advisable on this website.  However, based on the helpful fact summary you posted here, I am very certain that any lawsuit you filed against your employer would not succeed, and also that the U.S. EEOC would not issue you a right to sue" letter.I wish I had better news to report but this is my honest advice.  I hope that you can soon find a working environment where you contributions are respected and highly valued.  Have a blessed and ### ###.Be well."43860.8583333333 I worked as a BDC Service Representative for less than a month, I started having issues with drama and the other girls in the office, including the manager. They would laugh and cut up obnoxiously making it difficult to focus on my work and my customers while on the phone. The manager would pull girls away from their desk to discuss drama leaving the others to answer the phones constantly ###. The manager would sit on a file cabinet and gossip with the girls and make it a ### to me, affecting my ability to focus and hear my customers. When I presented my issues to the manager she basically told me â€œthatâ€™s a call center, get used to itâ€ I was told that I had an attitude while b### it to her attention and not even and hour later I was fired due to my â€œattitudeâ€. I was not disrespectful but firm in telling her what my setbacks were.  I had no warnings, I was not made to clock out and I did not sign anything saying I was being terminated (as I have in the past). With all this can I file for wrongful termination and win? Should they be held responsible for finding me another position? 43860.8277777778 Hello ###,You state that your employer requires â€œemployees to read self-help books on their own time as a requirement of employment.â€ I understand that you are asking whether time spent outside of work reading self-help books is compensable. This is a good question.The Fair Labor Standards Act (the â€œFLSAâ€) requires that an employer compensate an employee for all hours worked.  Section ### â€œemployâ€ as including â€œto suffer or permit to work.â€  ###.S.C. Â§ 203(g); see also ###.F.R. Â§ 785.11.  This rule applies to work performed away from the premises or the job site, including work performed at home.  â€œIf the employer knows or has reason to believe that the work is being performed, he must count the time as hours worked.â€  ###.F.R. Â§ 785.12. However, the FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay for employees employed as bona fide executive, administrative, professional, outside sales employees, and some computer employees.Attendance at lectures, meetings, training programs and similar activities are ### only if four criteria are met, namely: it is outside normal hours, it is voluntary, not job related, and no other work is concurrently performed. For example, time spent in outside study is not compensable if the studying is not required by the employer.  See Wage and Hour Opinion Letter ###.However, the situation you describe is different because your employer â€œrequiresâ€ employees to read self-help books outside of normal work hours. Because the reading is not â€œvoluntary,â€ time spent outside of normal work hours reading self-help books is likely compensable. Please note that this answer applies to employees that are â€œnon-exemptâ€ from the FLSA. Exempt workers are not entitled to overtime for hours worked over 40, even if, like here, they are working at home, outside of normal business hours.I hope this answers your question.Thank you.43883.7215277778 My employer requires employees to read self help books on their own time as a requirement of employment. This is not compensated time but they say because the person says they will do it before they are hired, that it is legal. Most of the employees are part time and hourly. My employer says they will not hire the person if they do not agree.I thought that Fair Labor Laws prohibit this. Is this a gray area? I just need to know so that I can argue that it can not be a requirement unless they offer pay for the time.43861.0138888889 Good afternoon to you, Mr. ###:I hope ###, and that this year will be a very ### and rewarding one.  You are very thoughtful to ask this question in advance, and I would urge you not to spend this money until you have cleared this with your former supervisor and HR official at Wal-Mart.  Clarify with them when your effective termination date was based on their records (despite your indication of ###), and see how the conversation goes from there.  If theIf sy decided for some reason not to enter your termination until a little later, whether you would be entitled to the money might depend on your benefits package, and whether you were entitled to paid sick or vacation leave.  If so and you confirm with HR that this was how your final two weeks were entered, you may be entitled to the money; otherwise, you are correct in thinking that there is a possibility that you will need to return the money.As of right now, this is more of an HR question than a strictly legal one (although law is always relevant to wage and salary questions, of course).  In order to preclude Wal-Mart imputing any liability to you personally, approach your former supervisor and the HR official at the store location and seek clarity on this issue.  That will probably take care of the situation.  If for some unexpected reason this turns out to be more complicated than it appears based on your description, you might briefly consult with a local employment law attorney in or around ### County.  If that next step is needed, I strongly recommend one of the best experts in this area of law, ### ### of Concord.  He is one of the best employment law attorneys in North Carolina.  Here is his link and contact information if needed:https://the###lawfirm.com/###-###-employment-lawyerI hope you can get this straightened out within the next week or two without undue inconvenience or burden on your time or finances.  Best wishes to you this new year.43863.75625 I recently put in my two week notice to end my employment with a large retail company as a salaried manager. My last day was clearly marked as ### and my supervisor confirmed. I received my final paycheck on ### as I should have. Today, I looked and I have another to paycheck ready to deposit on my account. It appears my employer has failed to terminate my employment, even after I notified them and havenâ€™t been on site since, and since Iâ€™m salary Iâ€™m still being paid. My question is, what actions do I need to take, if any? Am I required to return any funds deposited due to the employers negligence?43863.5576388889 I feel management at local state government entity is going to fire me tomorrow because I will not give them access to my ALL my medical files.  I feel they are using this to retaliate for my reporting my manager for discrimination and harassment.  I had a minor medical issue and some discomfort.  Last Friday my new manager I was assigned to told me I would be driving a school bus in the afternoons on a regular basis.  Since I was in some discomfort I asked her if she could hold off on implementing that as I was seeing a doctor and I had some additional doctors appointments.  She told me to bring in a note from my doctor.  When I brought in the note stating that I could benefit from not siting or standing for prolong periods my manager then sent it to HR and they wanted me to sign so they could access all my medical records.  I refused and they cancelled my pocket card which gives me permission to drive and train in state owned vehicles.  If I don't sign they will fire me tomorrow Feb. ###, ###.I wrote to the Superintendent after my receiving the letter from HR, explaining what happened and that when I was hired i was told after asking what the statement in the Job description meant, that I would not be used as a sub driver or running routes, only driving a route with students on the bus if I was showing the Trainee what driving with students was like.  They reneged on what I feel was a verbal agreement and now they are I feel demoting me and having me drive routes regularly.  I feel after writing this new Superintendent he is not inclined as the previous one to intervene and has not returned my emails.  The previous Superintendent had his Chief of Staff look into my claims of discrimination, Bullying and retaliation and so I was ### to another manager.  A couple of weeks ago I was ### again and feel since they had to divide my former managers responsibilities when they moved me to a new manager, but they moved that manager and want to re-solidify all her responsibilities including the trainers, two of us to report to the previous manager.So my questions are:If I was given a verbal contract (as to what my duties consisted of) in a hiring interview is that binding?If they fire me because I don't give them full and unfettered access to my medical records can they say it was with cause and stop me from getting benefits or suing? If I can have an answer today, tomorrow will be my last day if I don't forfeit my privacy rights.Thank you.Poppi Swindell43864.6958333333 Poppi,In reviewing your questions and the circumstances above I will share some observations with you and answer your questions.It appears that you requested an accommodation due to a medical condition.  The medical release form specifies that the records related to your request for accommodation be released, not necessarily your entire medical file.  Medical releases tend to be as broad as possible, but still tailored to a specific purpose. In this case, the release specifies that its for records  relating to my medical psychological and/or behavioral care treatment hospitalization evaluation testing progress diagnosis and/or prognosis regarding my request for potential reasonable accommodation(s) and/or leave under the Americans with Disabilities Act (###) regarding my asserted ### condition(s). " As you were requesting an accommodation they needed to seek documentation of the need for an accommodation. Your handbook pages outline the procedure for your responding to the request for medical information and accommodation documentation.  Depending on how you responded or failed to respond if you breach policy and procedure or fail to perform your job duties it would be possible that ### would be able to fire you "for cause." Generally speaking however employment in the state of North Carolina is "at will" unless there is a specific contract for employment.  At will means they can fire you for any reason or no reason at all.I do not see an employment contract in the documents you uploaded and you reference the potential for a "verbal contract." During your hiring were you presented with a job description to sign or review?  Do you have a copy of what the job description for your job title is?  If you could send that on I can advise you if the changes you feel they made to your job falls outside of the purview of the job description. Also did you run more regular routes at any point during your employment?Thanks###"43935.7555555556 I was recently laid off and offered severance pay for up to two weeks. However, payment of vacation time wasn't mentioned in the severance letter. The company has a PTO policy, but it wasn't posted or given to any employee.My offer letter states that, as a regional director, I am entitled to ###, but it doesn't state how vacation time is accrued or if there is a waiting period before PTO can be used.My question is..... Is the company required to pay me unused vacation time? 43868.86875 Maybe.  In NC, an employer is required to pay you for accrued unused vacation time unless there is a written forfeiture policy(check the employee handbook). You can file a free claim with the NC Department of Labor Wage and Hour division if your accrued unused vacation time does not show up with your final check.  However, I encourage you to have an attorney review the severance because they typically come with very broad releases and you will want to understand what you are giving up and what you might be able to negotiate.  43870.23125 Again, you were not wrongfully ###inated"; that has a specific legal meaning that is not the same as the way in which you are using that ###.  You have no lawsuit against your employer nor can you get your job back based on what you just described.  "Unfair ###ination" is not the same thing as "wrongful ###ination" in the eyes of the law.  The most you can do in this situation is to sue the person who made the false allegation for defamation (libel or slander).  An at-will employee can be fired at any time for any reason or for no reason stated.  The employer in an at-will situation could simply decide to fire someone just because s/he felt like it on that particular day.  Not every ###ination that is unfair or unfounded can be sued upon.  Again I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  The law cannot cure every bad thing that someone does to us."43872.6902777778 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  You will have to state far more than this; essentially, you stated a legal conclusion--I [was] wrongfully terminated"--that is not necessarily supported by facts.  Being under investigation--or fired--because of false accusations does not give you any right to pursue legal action against an employer in North Carolina.  Assuming you were an at-will employee you can be fired at any time for any reason or for no reason.  If someone lied about you and that caused you to lose your job you might have a defamation claim against that person but a lawyer would need to know more about what was said and what motivated the person to say it.  (Also note that defamation actions are terribly expensive and are not pursued on a contingency basis.)Please feel free to include more facts here if you wish; it is hard to offer a comprehensive analysis based on a one-sentence fact summary.  However I see nothing so far that would suggest you were "wrongfully terminated" as that phrase is construed under North Carolina law.  Absent illegal discrimination--based on race color national origin sex religion disability or age if over 40--or some other serious misconduct by the employer that constitutes a violation of public policy your termination was legal even if it was unfair or based on false statements by other people.I wish I had something more ### to write but I get these types of questions on this website and in my law practice and I am confident that this is accurate unless you have something compelling to add.I am sorry this happened to you and hope that you can soon find gainful (and personally fulfilling) employment before long.  Blessings and best wishes to you this new year."43871.9472222222 I were wrongfully terminated, and under investigation for false accusations.43871.9333333333 I worked with a company that accused me of abusing a resident that was under false allegations that investigated. I've been out of work for ######. The investigation was susbstainted and i was cleared on all charges and false allegations.43872.6576388889 In my opinion it's not fair nor right to have wrongfully terminated me over the phone without giving me a chance to prove my innocence. Also i received a document and i have all my documents etc in order to defend myself and pursue this matter further. I hope someone can lead me in the right direction to get this matter tooking care of.43872.6618055556 No problem.  Sorry I cannot offer something more ###.  I hope you are able to land comfortably on your feet very shortly.43872.7326388889 Thank you for your time and feedback. Now i understand it all.43872.7263888889 I am a retired (and disabled) veteran of the US Army. Currently I am employed with ### County Schools as a Secondary Education Teacher and Head Coach of the High School Softball Team. All athletic coaches were notified of the following:Recap MCS AD meeting:###. Activity Bus Drivers were discussed and agreed that all Head Coaches will be required to have a valid license. This will be added to the MCS Athletic Handbook for next year. Also, agreed that teams are responsible for driving needs, and paying a driver will come from team accounts. ( This has already been established here ,it is now going to be done countywide ). ###. It is the same message that has been communicated on several occasions, coaches are expected to have a bus license. We have several folks that need to act on this . ###. See me with any questions. MCS â€“ ### County SchoolsAD â€“ Athletic Director Based upon these future requirements, I will not be able to meet the requirements of the upcoming MCS Athletic Handbook of CDL licensing. My combat related disabilities, and associated medicinal treatment, preclude me from obtaining a CDL to legally drive a school bus or Activity Bus. If I cannot meet these requirements, then my position as a Head Coach is in jeopardy. Is there a law, or precedent, that will help me better understand my rights in this situation, or is my situation hopeless?43872.7055555556 If you can't get a CDLbecasue of a disability you need to request an ### accomodation that would waive this requirement.  Has this been a requirement in the past or is this a new requirement?  Well it doesn't matter.  Request an accomodation under the ### that allows a work around.  Maybe have smeone else drive for you?  THis requires some creativity to describe an accomodation that would work.  Contact the Job ccomodation Network at https://askjan.org/ to come up with some ideas on the accomodation.   If they request a medical certification then get your doctor to explain why you can't get a CDL given your disabilities.  Be explicit on why your disabiity makes the CDL impossible to obtain. If they come back and say this is a critical/essential job requirement, then they will have to explain why it is.  43948.6888888889 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for this very interesting question--in one of my favorite areas of law, which is corporate and small business law.  Assuming that both LLCs in this instance are properly constituted, the way you would go about this is to have, both in your contract with the second LLC, and in your contracts with customers, indemnification provisions that make clear that certain liabilities will be assigned to the LLC doing the work for you.  To some extent, this would already be the case since the second LLC is an independent contractor rather than an employee of your LLC, but the contractual arrangement I just mentioned would make this even clearer to both LLCs, and the customers/other ### third parties with whom the LLCs do business.  Unless the activity that gives rise to liability is an inherently dangerous" activity the liability for negligence would fall principally on the party (i.e. the independent contractor) that is actually doing the work.  When the "inherently dangerous" activity is in existence however both LLCs can be liable since inherently dangerous activities are "nondelegable" as a matter of law regardless of whether the parties wish to arrange otherwise.  If the duties and liabilities are nondelegable the injured party may sue either or both LLCs at the same time and it would be up to the second LLC's insurance provider to determine how much of the liability the insurance policy would cover.  In a situation where both LLCs are jointly and severally liable any liability that the second LLC's policy does not cover would have to be paid by your LLC and the second LLC's funds outside the policy proceeds to the injured party.NOTE: even if you and the second LLC agree about indemnification and allocation of liabilities always be aware that you must defer despite such agreement to two things: (###) North ### common law non-delegable duty doctrine (for inherently dangerous activities) and (###) the liability limits of the second LLC's business liability insurance policy.  Remember that if a party is injured because of the second LLC's fault and that LLC incurred that liability in the course of doing work for your LLC the insurance company will disregard any collaboration with you if it falls outside the scope of the policy.  So if you want to be assured that you are protected simply because the second LLC is assuring you that it will cover you you need to inspect the full policy description to confirm this before entering into any indemnification agreements.You will want to work with a business lawyer who has handled many complex contracts/deals in order to make sure that you are getting the protection that you are hoping for--unless of course the law or the policy does not allow.  This will depend on specific facts in existence between you and the second LLC which would need to be vetted by counsel who is retained to specifically advise in this transaction; my general response here can be (hopefully) very informative as to what issues to think through but this answer cannot be relied upon as a substitute for comprehensive legal advice once you start entering into contracts with the second LLC.Hope this is clear and informative.  I really enjoyed working through these issues with you and appreciate your question.  I hope that ###."43884.7527777778 If I register a tree business as limited liability company in nc, can I operate my business using the insurance of the person I get to do the work and face no negative consequences? For example, hiring another small LLC that has insurrance to cut the trees but using their insurrance on a job trusted to my company while they do the work? I'm a woman but I'd like to own a tree company but would rather not involve myself in doing the physical aspects of the job. What is the best way to go about this?43884.3534722222 Certainly.  God bless all of you.43885.9388888889 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  If this is a ### employer, there would no hard legal requirement that your friend be paid a salary or bonus commensurate to a higher status with the company, even if the friend is temporarily taking on extra responsibility as if he were a ### officer.  If he is a government employee, there would be a much stronger argument for a bonus or pay raise, since local, state and federal government employees are classified according to ### pay grades that are well defined under HR protocols.I think your friend's ### around fairness are correct, however, and I hope that he can persuade his employer to, at the very least, extend him a bonus for his extra work, if not a permanent salary increase.  If he is working in private industry, this is entirely negotiable as between employer and employee.NOTE: This however does not absolve the employer from paying overtime if your friend is an hourly wage employee.  If so, and he is working more than ###, he must be paid time-and-a-half for any time above and beyond the minimum.  If he is salaried, however, this requirement would not apply.Thank you for asking this important question in reference to your friend.  I hope he can be rewarded for his willingness to step up and go above and beyond the call of duty.  Best wishes to all of you as spring is near.43885.7270833333 I am asking this for a male friend of my family. He has been asked by his employer to be a fill in supervisor for ###. Now ###. He has been filling in off and on for over ###. He was just informed it would be ###. He only gets full time assistants pay even though he does ###. He has no assistant help. He has not signed any documents stating his new fill in position. But most if not all supervisors know his roll. My question is, is there a law against him being paid less for the work he's doing?Note: He can not be advanced to supervisor until a position comes available.Thanks.43885.4555555556 Thank you for your reply. 43885.9381944444 As a general rule, harassment and the creation of a hostile work environment are only prohibited under the law if based on an employee's membership in a protected class.  Protected classes include race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, military status, disability, pregnancy, or genetic information.  Applying that principle to your question, you will likely only have a case of some sort if the harassment that you were subjected to was based on your membership in one or more of the above protected classes.  If the harassment was unrelated to the above protected classes (even if you were in a protected class), it will generally not be prohibited under the law.  The law also imposes other requirements to make out a claim of harassment and hostile work environment, including that it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter your conditions of employment.  If the harassment you were subjected to was based on your membership in a protected class, and it was severe and pervasive, you may have a claim.  I would recommend you contact an attorney specializing in discrimination.  You can also file a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC, which you or the attorney will have to do first to bring a claim anyway.  Note that you only have ### -- after that time expires, your claim likely disappears.  If you quit in late February, you will likely have until ###.  Instructions on how to file a Charge are available here: ###.I will also note, since you mentioned it, that it is unlawful to retaliate against someone for taking FMLA leave.  If you were harassed as soon as you returned from FMLA leave, that may indicate retaliation, though I would look for other evidence of retaliation to support such a claim, such as people giving you a hard time for taking FMLA.  Timing alone is likely not enough to support the claim.  You do not need to file a Charge with the EEOC for an ### claim, and you should operate assuming you have two years to file a lawsuit for such a claim (you may have three years if the violation was willful, but you should assume you have two years in case you cannot establish that the violation was willful).  As such, you will likely have until ###, if such a claim exists.Good luck!43921.5444444444 On ###th I went on FMLA due to stress of the then supervisor. Upon my return on ###th  i was made aware that she was no longer with the company. Before my move to home office i was in the Burlington office. Upon my return I notice my colleagues were acting differently towards me. The seem to not want to be seen talking to me and kept a distance. I also noticed that my leadership was not so welcoming upon my return. Home office was a very uninviting place. I had asked my VP if I may return to the Burlington office and explained why to her. She refused and said they wanted me at this location. They have not been supportive of me every since they had to let the supervisor go. My stress level started to go back up. I have never had a corrective action until I was under another supervisor while they filled the position of a new Work Base Learning supervisor. I did my job to the best of my ability without proper training or mentorship. I have been feeling that they wanted me out of the company because they had to let the supervisor go.

If they do not, you can contact the North Carolina Department of Labor.  The NCDOL telephone number is : ###â€###.43899.6625 ###:As a general rule, you are entitled to be restored to your job or an equivalent job after you return from FMLA.  Employers are prohibited from terminating employees merely because they took FMLA leave.  FMLA leave is protected leave.  However, that does not prohibit employers entirely from terminating employees while they are on FMLA leave -- an employer may terminate an employee on FMLA leave as long as the termination is unrelated to FMLA leave.  For example, if an employer discovers that an employee has been defrauding the employer or engaging in some other misconduct, and the discovery occurs while the employee was on FMLA leave, the employer will be allowed to terminate the employee, even though the employee was on FMLA leave at the time, because the termination is unrelated to FMLA leave.  Essentially, you are entitled to get your job back when you take FMLA leave, and an employer cannot discriminate against you for taking FMLA leave, but FMLA leave does not act as a shield to an otherwise valid, FMLA-unrelated termination.In your case, you noted that you went on FMLA leave on ###, and you were told about two weeks before Christmas that your position needed to be filled.  Because FMLA only entitles employees to ### (about ###), I'm not sure whether you were still on FMLA in mid-December, about ###.###.  Do you have any documentation providing that you were still on leave at the time?  The date of your termination, ###, raises similar concerns.  Were you actually on FMLA leave at the time?  Did you still have FMLA leave in the bank at that time?  Also, did they ever tell you why they terminated you?To answer the above questions, you may want to look at the Eligibility Notice, Rights and Responsibilities Notice, and any other notices/representations the employer made to you.  If you don't understand them, you can send them to me and I can try to help you figure this out.  You can also send the FMLA forms and employee handbook you referenced in your question.As a side note, another issue that may pop up here, even if the FMLA does not apply, is whether there was a problem with your termination under the ###.

I asked why she said she didn't know.  I went by my place of supposed employment and spoke with our local Human Resource person ### ### and she said she didn't know anything about it, but that ### Mervin was handling everything.  I stopped in  ### McMorriss' office and asked him why he said that ### had told him to take me out of the system. I verbally stated to him, that you took me out of the system without prior notice or anything! He said if he had done wrong he would get it corrected and that he would try and reach out to ### who is the Corporate Person in HR,  well we waited about ###,i . He then said i can call corporate, because he gives up on trying to get her. I have emailed, texted, and i haven't had any reply from ###.  Now i no longer have health insurance through the company at all. I went on fmla on ### and i have copy of fmla and I requested copy of Leave of absence form our local HR Ms. ### ### said that fmla and l.o.a. are the same things, I have copy of hand book and it doesn't say anything about immediate termination while on fmla w/ disability.  I went out on  ### to have triple heart bypass.  and i feel that i was wrongfully terminated.  Ms ### Mervin told me about ### ###-###, but that i would have a job when i got better and returned i would be on leave of absence until then, but i could return with same pay as  long as they had a position for me and that they would be sending me a letter, and that was in December the next thing i know is I find out that on ###, i was terminated without prior notice.So my question is do i have grounds for a wrongful termination case.  I don't know what can be accomplished from this, but it is the principle as i told Mr. McMorris that i felt it was unprofessional and Cruel to do this without notification at all.

They then proceeded to tell me that they would be expecting me to repay my draw balance. There was no repayment schedule outlined in the case of separation in the original contract. They also promised 50% of commissions made (which there was pre COVID) would repay the draw balance and the other 50% would go to me as commission. That turned out not to be the case and they also lowered my salary within my first year from ### as it stated in the agreement to ### notifying me via email. Besides the fact this individual is a very ### person can they legally do this? I would have never entered an agreement willingly and knowingly if I knew if the job ### I would be in debt to this company/person for the rest of my life. That seems a bit illegal to fire someone and then try to recoup money paid for the work product provided.   I have attached my employment agreement for your review. THANK YOU!!!!44092.9479166667 This is a bit too complicated for this free service.  You should find a local employment/contract law attorney.  What I see is that it is an at will employment contract which means they can lay you off whenever they want and for no reason.  The Draw" seems to be an interest free loan that is paid to you in ###.  Seems to be a way to give you a salary  during a total commissions paying job.  So half of your commissions was supposed to go to pay that $### back that you were being given as basically an advance on your commissions.  You would have to figure out what commissions you made what 50% of it is that went toward paying back the draw and then was supposed to go to you.  Yes the is no payment plan specified so basically you owe that amount and need to work out a deal with them or let them take you to court.  The big question is what is the actual amount you were paid in advance that you still owe back after commissions were figured into it.So get all the data needed to figure out what part of the draw you already received how much commissions you made and the 50% that went toward paying back your draw and the 50% you should have been paid.  If you never received the commissions count them toward the draw recovery payments.  Need to figure out what the true number should be and go from there.Good luck###"44093.0326388889 My current employer is in ### and I work ###.  ###. But the other ###.

She's helping others on the team but not me. I've asked her to train new staff, she's passed over me and asked others who don't want to train.

She became angry when I asked her not to do this and sent me a ### and underlined email defending her decision.Although I'm not perfect, I've never been written up nor am I a discipline problem. I'm a professional and want to advance my career. I have asked if she has concerns with my work performance, I've asked of I can train new staff, I've asked if I can get the same career development as others on the team.

The owners told me all their ### do ###, and all ### start off at 12ph. I agreed to proceed, and they put me on the schedule to begin training. In total i worked four shifts. I received good feedback initially. The owner set up an email for me, put me on the schedule and was setting up an account for me in their POS. He even told me they were going to make a copy of the keys for me, and showed me the security codes for the building. These were all signs that i had been formally hired and that i was going to complete the training and work for them. In my second shift that i worked, the co-owner, emailed me financial documents. He instructed me to email them back to him by the following Tuesday so that i could be put in the payroll system and be paid on time. He told me pay was biweekly. I didnâ€™t get around to reviewing the documents until the day there were due, i filled them all out and emailed them back. In my email also i asked for them to tell me what my schedule would be because I didnâ€™t see it on their app. While reviewing the documents i found that it says that you only get paid for training if you complete the ###. This alarmed me because i was never told that before i started training, but i filled it out anyway because i was under the impression these forms were necessary for payroll. Days later they fire me via email. I was surprised but responded asking for payment since i worked ### for them. I never agreed to work for free! They told me Iâ€™m not gonna be paid because i signed that document and didnâ€™t complete the ###. I responded its illegal to not pay people for training and the only reason I didnâ€™t complete it was because you fired me. He told me that his lawyers created those documents and that theyâ€™re in accordance with â€œtrial and auditionâ€ rates. I have never heard those terms before. Itâ€™s the law in ### upon hiring an employee to clearly state the amount of pay and method of payment. When he offered me $12ph, that was an oral agreement. I responded he should have disclosed those rates with me before i started working, not after. If they had told me before this was how i was going to get paid, then i would have declined to work for them. The contract i signed is dated AFTER all the hours of training i worked, and thereâ€™s nothing in there about it being retroactive. That contract should only account for the hours worked after i signed it, not before. The oral agreement that we discussed in our interview for ### ###. 44190.4576388889 Thank you so much for your response. Do you believe that I could hold them legally to what they originally offered me in my interview in small claims  ? In my opinion that was an oral agreement and thatâ€™s what I thought I was being paid from the beginning. I will definitely be reporting them however because they mainly hire young women and I believe itâ€™s intentional. They donâ€™t think they know any better.

If you are an employee, usually when you are assigned a shift and do not perform that is grounds for firing.  If there are health safety issues, there are proper procedures and they would need to be reviewed to see if you followed them for not performing the tasks requested by your employer.  If there are possible gender discrimination issues, there are also proper procedures you are usually required to follke reporting it to human resources so they can investigate.Please contact a local employment attorney to discuss your issues and see if the employer did anything illegal.###44192.6923611111 in addition: If one is familiar with nursing jargon or lingo? Stating that a nurse has or is abandoning" their assignment is a "bad thing." Because leaving or quitting after getting report from another nurse is taking legal responsibility for those patients. Legally it can be considered neglect which is also punishable by the board of nursing as well. I know that I was not abandoning my assignment because I never took report from another nurse.

Iâ€™ve been working for a company for over seven years and I was laid off during Covid because I couldnâ€™t return the date that they wanted me to return .I asked for family leave because Im at high risk due to my asthma, had to care for my daughter which school closed during Covid and my grandmother and nephew I had to care from them as well due to my mother being a nurse sheâ€™s an essential worker and had to be at work which had several positive cases .

My Employer laid me off stating they needed workers to work in order to get a loan that was being offered and workers on leave wouldnâ€™t help them. Well they also stated that I can come back at a later if a position was open and I did just that and they refused to rehire me and itâ€™s Retaliation because I couldnâ€™t come back when they wanted they told me other workers weâ€™re able to work it out and get to work and they have more children and issues then me . Which I find Absurd because every situation is different. Is this considered wrongful termination? Thank you in advance for your time. 44210.8666666667 It is fact specific and your facts seem to be more you wanted to then you needed to.  Here is what the employer will say, from what I can decipher from the things you wrote.###)  Your household seems to be you, your school aged daughter, your mother who works as a nurse, grandmother and nephew (no age or school status provided).###)  No one in the household had symptoms or was exposed to be recommended quarantine except maybe your mother but that was unclear from your facts.###)  Your mother worked in a covid environment and came home, but that was OK?###)  The schools being closed is an excuse you can use to a point and there might be time limits on how long you can and still get unemployment, and you also had other adults in the household.  Family leave doesn't mean paid all the time and the paid part can be limited.It will also depend on the type of work and if it was something essential that needed to stay open, etc.As you can see, there are lots of things to look at.  You can always file a complaint with the state labor and workforce department, or contact a local labor attorney who can look at all the details and ask more questions to see if you have a case.Good luck,###44213.7916666667 Okay I worked for this company a month postpartum from aa c-section which this company knew.

I had worked enough hours to cover one week of missing pay. As a result, I was fired.The situation:I was displaying symptoms of Covid-###, sneezing, and a fever. I notify my employer through the online system. I was automatically given two weeks off. I was required to submit a negative test result and a doctor's letter stating that I was ordered to self-quarantine. I submitted the negative results but did not submit the doctor's letter; I did not have health insurance and could not afford the out pocket cost to go see a doctor. I requested to return back to work the next day but was denied. I notify the employer that I do not health insurance and could not provide the doctor. The employer said unfortunately, you will be charged two weeks of work of miss pay. I told the employer I will be fired if you charge me.

I replied with an email stating that I would like to be paid within two weeks. Now I am asking for legal advice on this website. What should I do? Should I talk to a lawyer?

Medical exemptions are only being considered for those who had a severe allergic reaction to other past vaccinations.  In the beginning they were allowing more exemptions since they didn't know, but as time goes by there is more confidence in the vaccination not causing issues which would justify a medical exemption.If you are wanting to fight the issue, you will need to find a local attorney that might be able to help.  With how new everything is, the challenges to mandates are very difficult right now.###44505.1361111111 I had originally filed for a religious and medical exemption back in August.

After the investigation was over i  still felt like I didnâ€™t do enough so I left a negative review of the daycare.  It detailed some of the things that were wrong with the place and how they operated, but I left out the details about the abuse. They sent me a cease and desist. It says I now canâ€™t be in contact with any of the kids that attend there, previously attended there, or their parents. The issue is that I already have been working with a child that previously attended the daycare. If they find that out, can they take legal action against me? Also, would it help me or hurt me to take down my review? I live in ###. 44515.7166666667 It's a little strong, but to the point.  You are not legally allowed to try to take clients that were there while you worked there, whether you get them to switch from there or they already left.  After they have been somewhere else for a year or so then come to your business would not be as big a deal.I do not know what you wrote, but do not write more.  And if anything you wrote is false or you don't have the proof to back it up, you might want to remove it.  It is called defamation and if you are hurting their business without proof or your statements you can be sued for their losses because of it.  There are too many keyboard warriors these days that just get online and write without thinking of the consequences.  If you ant to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau or if there was an employee issue that should be a concern of the labor department, that is different.

Hereâ€™s the letter. If you need a better photo let me know.44515.9645833333 Iâ€™ve been working for this this company for ###.###. For that position I was supposed to be crossed trained for the platform side (who opens the accounts). I never revived training during the first ### , staffing , not having a steady manager and now COVID ( no training available).However Iâ€™ve seen several people who I have worked with hired and crossed train on teller and platform side. Before my most recent manager came we had one who spoke to our district manager and told him I was interested in moving up . And he agreed and was happy to move me up but I had to wait because there werenâ€™t any classes. Next thing you know a new person was hired in the position I was supposed to move up to and I was again stuck . Now I have a new manager and explained the same thing to him and I was able to receive training but not move up ( to what is now since we have merged called a relationship ###, my position is a universal ### the equivalent of Branch ###II). The guy who was hired was a white male and he worked in my branch for a while then was transferred to our sister branch but I never got moved up only crossed trained. Fast forward my coworker who use to be a team lead told me she saw the pay for a new teller we had who came in with no experience or degree and he is getting more than me. And I do so much more work , also now with my training opening simple accounts. I spoke to my manager only stating someone is working here with no experience and being paid more than me , I would like a raise. He said he would speak to the district manager but he knows that he will asked what have I been doing to prove I deserve a raise basically. I said thatâ€™s not right I work myself to death and someone comes in ( a white male no experience) and gets paid more than me. Now I have been looking for other work and openly expressed it to my manager. But I just recently found out he promoted the new guy who has now been here for only ###â€™ve had! And I told him I said I told you whatâ€™s been happening to me and you did the same thing to me. Now heâ€™s really going to be getting paid more and trained in less than a year when my training had been dragged out . He said you were looking for new work but I said you didnâ€™t even present it to me to be considered. I am a black women who is being overlooked when opportunity is present and paid less than people who walk in with no degree or experience, for what seems to me is racially ###. 44525.6375 You will need to consult with a local employment attorney.  What might seem like racial discrimination might not be there.  There are lots of factors as to experience that accounts for differences in pay.  The new person might have a degree or advanced degree.  If you are telling your employer that you are looking to leave they might question your loyalty.  In an industry that includes sales, personalities of the employees and how they interact with customers matters.  All these things are factors that need to be looked at and much more.  It isn't just black and white.  It will take time for an attorney to look at all the factors to determine if there is discrimination or just business decisions.  ### does have an equal pay law but there are factors that need to look at there also.  You can contact your county bar association for a referral if you can't find one on your own.###44525.6909722222 Hello, My name is ### ### and I'm searching for some legal advice. I'm twenty-seven, I work in New ### for a company that's based in New York, called TransPerfect. I've been at this company for some time, ###, and I had two positions. I am currently a service desk analyst, which is basically that falls in the line with IT". My team handles Health Science sort of things especially lab trials and lab data. I started this position in ###'ve felt I've been mistreated in my workplace/amongst my team. I work from home but I deal with a team station out of Pune; I am also the only ### American on my team. During my time my current boss had an understanding that I was new to the Service Desk Career and needed to "had my hand-held" throughout my position. My training was improper and didn't truly guide me in any way.For the next ### months I was given ### training from the Pune team and was told to review training videos that consisted of low-quality barely audible instructions. Meetings where I had ### ###. Even after getting such ### training and informing my boss on the quality of training I felt it wasn't addressed properly amongst my peers. Instead of stating to his team that they upgrade training or even add just a bit more effort it came across as "more like a rumor" as if I was just accusing the team of failing to train me. This sort of training and mishandling has led to me improperly progressing tasks at my job and lead to me feeling alienated by my team affecting me mentally and leaving me to believe that I had learned everything on my own.There's a lot more than I can even fit into this advice letter ### from employees disorganization on the team that led to me working more on projects that could've easily been done calls from my boss being left to deal with projects and other tasks on my own even when the boss directs them to help me in some manner and being unprofessionally insulted at work in front of my boss.But ultimately this all came down to this scenario where I asked my boss for more time to complete a "constant project" that I manage. I was never late with delivering these projects but I was now because of the number of tasks that were building up due to lack of employees. This led to my boss again completely ignoring what I requested alienation beration and later on a ### parole violation. The evidence that were used against me were even pieces of evidence that were from my first offense and from my days of training. I decided to collect evidence of this and was told to seek legal help. Do I have a case for this?"44538.6319444444 These employment cases need a thorough review of the evidence.  You should contact your county bar association for a referral to an employment attorney.

I was waiting by the phone.  I learned afterwards that I was supposed to call them at ###  How do you go about filing court of appeals (unemployment compensation appeal)43438.9131944444 Your initial appeal is to an appeals tribunal which is the hearing which you referred to missing due to thinking they would call you instead of you calling them.  An appeal from the Appeals Tribunal is call an Application for Review to the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission and all it takes is submitting something saying you want an appeal.  I'm assuming that you have already done that since you are asking about filing an appeal to the Court of Appeals.  In order to file such an appeal you must file a notice of appeal but based upon your reason for appealing it is a waste of time.  There are numerous appellate court opinions clearly stating that failing to follow the instructions contained in the notice does not constitute good cause for failure to appear.  There were a few cases holding otherwise when they first started using the conference call systems requiring you to call in rather than the referee calling you but those cases were based on the fact that the division changed its procedure without first changing the state regulations dictating how a participant was to participate in the hearing.  At that point the division went through the process of correcting the regulations and getting them approved.  Since that time the cases have all squarely held that failing to call in is not good cause for not appearing.Sorry but you are out of luck if you based your reason for not participating on your assuming the referee would call you.43439.0111111111 I worked at ### hair salon in overland park, ###. I put in my two weeks notice back in mid to late july and started the new company in august. However, ### has refused to send or have me pick up my last paycheck. I didn't know that they refused or never sent it to me until i called. The owner was very hostile on the phone. He even asked me how i like it as in not receiving my last paycheck. It should be about ###.###. So, that is the back story.  They still refuse to send it to me.     My question is: How can i write an email asking for my paycheck or is there any legal options in order to get it? 43440.9236111111 Send an email requesting the check as you want to give them a chance to make it right before you are forced to file a complaint with the Department of Labor. That should be sufficient to get them to respond. If it doesnâ€™t then file a complaint with the Department of Labor. 43440.9819444444 I went to work for a contractor in Missouri. I worked on a building at university of ###. I never got any money and the guy kept tools I left in his truck. How can I get what is owed to me?43442.3423611111 You can file a lawsuit if you cannot convince the party that hired you to pay voluntarily. Youâ€™ll have a better chance f success and of collecting if you hire an attorney but if you cannot afford one then you can sue pro se. 43443.8097222222 I work for a state agency and we have employees that are new and some have been there for ###. Most are between that. The head of the agency and I believe their supervisor have recently decided that employees need to read and sign a form in front of a notary who is also an employee saying that we will support the constitution and not join any groups, etc. that support ### the government. I have a problem with this. I am a loyal citizen and will always be so I find it offensive. However, along with other documents about internet protocol, dress code, etc. that have been signed in the past when employment started where my signature was enough; I feel it gets worse when having to sign in front of the notary which I think makes it a legal document. I of course don't want to be terminated but don't want to sign either at least where it can be used as a legal contract. I don't trust my employer and most state agencies are not required to sign this. Do I have any legal rights if I am terminated for not signing or signing under duress?43442.9506944444 Practically speaking, I see no problem with signing this form.  Complying with the constitution and not ###" the government seem like things we all should be willing to agree to.  I'm sure this is not your reasoning but for ### sake if an employee was planning to join a group with the goal of ### the government violating this agreement would be low on their list of concerns.if you refuse to sign and get fired you have the same rights as any other citizen- the right to hire an attorney and sue if you were fired for an illegal cause:  because of your race religion or some other protected status - not sure being a government ### would count but an employment law specialist attorney could give you more info.Also as an aside you should know that in general a document with your signature can be used against you whether your signature is notarized or not. I hope this information helps. Happy Holidays!"43455.6798611111 In order to use a subpoena there must be an active lawsuit. You cannot just get a blank subpoena and us it to require someone to turn over documents. Trying to do so is illegal and can get you into considerable trouble. 43448.9027777778 My previous employer refuses to give a copy of documents I have signed, stating that I must file a subpoena. I have a subpoena but am unsure as to the process of filing it to get documents that aren't related to an existing case. 43448.8763888889 There is none. Your former employer has no obligation to provide a copy to you unless you have sued them and requested it in discovery or have subpoenaed the documents in the course of litigation with another party. 43449.2270833333 What files are used to gain copies of documents when the company with holding has demanded /declared the requirement of a subpoena?43448.9423611111 Hello,On ###th I was terminated from my job. It felt mutual that my boss and I decided it was best for me to part was because the workload was beginning to change and grow and I could not keep up with it and my work ethic was suffering because of my bosses unrealistic standards and ability to not train me on new tasks correctly. I got let go from the job. The termination process was short, I got my last check and she told me to gather my things and leave. Before leaving, I deleted all files off of my computer. None of the files I had removed were in any way tied to the company or inaccessible to other coworkers elsewhere. During the termination process or any time during my job was I told not to remove files from my computer. They were simply old files of images or personal files that would not be used again. My intention of deleting them was simply to allow the person taking my place to not have to deal with a bunch of unwanted files on their computer. Today I received a letter from my former boss explaining now that I owe her $2,000.###, and she put a stop payment on my final paycheck so I did not receive it because I deleted these files. She is also now saying I owe her money because a precious client cut her contract because of a mistake I made while working there. I feel she is harassing me at this point. I have already filed for unemployment. Is any of this legal? And what can I do at this point? 43452.95 There is a statute that provides monetary penalties against ### employees damaging an employer's computers including deleting files.  So yes the employer can do this and you may want to get an attorney to assist you with the case.  As for owing the employer money because of an alleged error leading to a customer cutting a contract that will not fly nor can the employer stop payment on your payroll check to get compensated.  That is a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  To be clear, the FLSA doesn't preclude the stop pay on the check but rather it prohibits an employer from taking deductions from an employee's check that would result in the employee getting paid less than minimum wage.  In this ### by stopping payment on the check the employer has in essence reduced the amount paid to zero so I think it clearly is less than minimum wage and therefore a FLSA violation.I suggest that you contact an employment attorney in your area that routinely represents employees to discuss your situation.43453.7097222222 I'm employed through a temp agency and whenever they give us an assignment they make us sign a contract stating the pay and how many hours and days we will be working. I just signed one stating that I would be working at ### health for ###. Yesterday we where told that ### health wants us to work all ###. I need to know What can be done about this A.S.A.P.43462.8513888889 Naturally I cannot interpret a document without having access to it in its entirety but it is highly unlikely that the document which you signed would qualify as a written employment contract.  The document you signed almost certainly didn't provide a duration that you would be employed and say that you could only be discharged for cause.  I have represented several temporary agencies in the past and while they provide information about the assignment such as you describe the document will never qualify as a written employment contract.  The reason being that would create a problem for the agency if its client decided that it no longer wanted to use a given person which is one of the benefits of using a temp agency.  I'm certain that that your employment remains at will employment.  As such, the employer can always change the terms of employment at any time.  If you do not like the new terms of employment then you are free to refuse to accept them but that will result in you no longer being employed.  The only exception is that pursuant to Missouri law an employer may not lower your wage without ###.Bottom line, I don't blame you for being frustrated about having to work ###'t any legal protection that you can turn to.  You are, of course, free to take the document which you believe constitutes a contract to a lawyer to interpret but I wouldn't get your hopes up.43462.9256944444 It is free to file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC or Missouri Commission on Human Rights.  I recommend that he meet with a couple of local employment attorneys to see if anyone would represent him on a contingency basis.  Employment suits are tough, even for parties represented by counsel, so expect it to be a challenge to find representation but it won't cost anything to try.  When he meets with an attorney, he should be well organized and bring a written summary of the facts.43465.8118055556 my son got fired from his job today.  He is gay and his mother worked at same company and was fired in October, but got ### from employer.  He was fired for both being gay and in retaliation for his mom's ###.

If you cannot find an attorney to represent you on a contingency basis, that means that no attorney thus far views your situation as you do.  Employment cases are tough, so itâ€™s challenging to find contingency representation. 43474.1534722222 Again, thank you.43479.9145833333 Can they force" you to perform you job duties?  No.  However they can discharge you for refusing to perform your job duties and odds are that you will then be denied unemployment benefits.  Unless you have a written employment contract (and you likely don't unless you are in a union or a highly paid executive) you are considered an at-will employee.  As such you can be discharged at any time  and for any reason or even no reason at all.  The only thing an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon you being a member of a protected class.  The protected classes are based upon race sex age religion national origin or disability.  Since you are talking about not performing assigned job duties the issue is not related to you being a member of a protected class.I think the real issue here is a misunderstanding on your part regarding your legal liability associated with these ###s.  First off every company that ### out products to a vendor will own those products so I'm confused as to what you mean by "prepaid by the ### corp."  Did you mean to say prepaid by your employer?  If so that makes more sense.  By checking in the freight items you are attesting that those items which you check off as being there are in fact in that pallet delivery.  That is true whether or not the items were prepaid so that really has no bearing on your situations.  As for being financially liable I'm guessing that a supervisor may have said something to emphasize the importance of you accurately checking the ### contents rather than just checking off that everything was there.  It is doubtful that you would be held financially accountable for any missing items directly as that might very well violate the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) depending upon how the employer chose to deduct such losses from your paycheck.  What is more likely is that you would be disciplined and ultimately discharged for repeated errors in checking in the items.Bottom line if you refuse to perform your assigned job duties you will be discharged and likely denied unemployment benefits.  Accordingly I strongly encourage you to return to work and perform your assigned job duties.  I would try to speak with someone in management about you having been told that you would be financially liable for any errors  to get ###.  If your employer insists that it is going to start deducting any ### then you may start looking for another job elsewhere.Best of luck to you."43479.7770833333 I am employed by ###, and ### pays for, and orders our cleaning supplies. The pallet comes in, to the attention of, ### ### at ###.  I've never heard of, requiring a Day ### (cleaning lady) to check in freight. Thank you for the information. I do wish there was an open line of communication, between all of the three players. This has been the most hostile working environment I've ever worked in. And probably will be, trying to locate an attorney to represent me. What type of attorney, do I need to look for?  I have worked for ### for ###, and have always completed my job. But, because of their lack of ability to find a person to work the night shift, I have worked 12, ### ###. I was hired for ### ### ###, but tried to step up and help.

I recently found out, that it is prepaid, and have refused to check-in" the freight pallet. I have no problem putting the stock away but don't feel as though I should be financially responsible for this freight.

Can they force me to do this?Thanking you in advance### ###"43479.7006944444 You are welcome.  You asked about an attorney but do not say for what purpose.  As I explained, based upon what you referenced in your initial post you do not legally have a leg to stand on.  In your last post you mentioned that this was the most hostile work environment you have ever worked in so perhaps that is why you are asking for the name of an attorney.  If that is the case, you have not provided nearly enough information to suggest that you have a viable case for that either. The ### hostile work environment" has been tossed around quite a bit in recent years but unfortunately the ### does not mean what most people think it means.  The ### came to being in the context of sexual harassment cases but can be applied to other employment discrimination matters.  However it does not apply simply because the environment is hostile.  If I were your boss and I yelled and screamed at you everyday that would not be a hostile environment case UNLESS it could be proven that I was doing it based upon you being a member of a protected class.  So if I scream at you because I'm a sexist jerk then you have a case.  If I scream at you because you are a ### fan that is perfectly legal and you have no recourse other than to find another job.If you wish to speak to a claimant's employment attorney to see if you have anything to pursue you can try calling ### ### or ### ###."43479.9125 I was a Community Living Supervisor at Easter Seals Midwest. I quit my job on ###. I have submitted my final appeal for unemployment. During my hearing the Human Resource rep from ### misinformed the ### regarding the staffing crisis. I was working anywhere from 60-###. Due to my position, I didn't have a choice because if I didn't work, the individuals ### supported would have been home alone when they were supposed to be receiving care. I provided support with medical appointment, financial tracking, daily ### care and so much more. The individual I provided support to required total care. I was physically lifting ### daily, sometimes ###-###, to transfer an individual. I drastically started losing weight. I suffered from a ### 9/###. I also had a hysterectomy on ###. Again, my restrictions were ignored. I understand that no job is perfect but I don't want to die to make a living. I want to sue for prejury.43479.7819444444 Perjury is a crime so it is not something for which you can sue someone.  The prosecutor would have to file charges and pursue the case and I guarantee you that won't happen.  As far as the law on overtime is concerned, that is a fairly broad question.  I assume that what you really want to know is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requirements for when someone is paid overtime.  Overtime pay is to be calculated at 150% of your normal hourly wage rate and paid on every hour worked over ###.  If you were not paid properly for overtime then you should contact an attorney experienced with FLSA claims.43479.925 I worked for a construction company and they havenâ€™t paid me any money as well as kept my tools.

I'm glad they are working with you on this.43494.9569444444 I was fired yesterday for doing my job, $###, and I was fired even though there was no proof of me stealing any money. However they say they fired me for using a register that wasnâ€™t assigned to me. But we do it all the time, and itâ€™s suppose to have been locked by the other cashier when she is not near it. I was fired because I was seen helping a customer, by giving them there change. I wasnâ€™t seen stealing or pocketing he money. I am on disability and have been since ###, and they are trying to drag my name through the mud without any proof and are ### me with ### if I go back into the store. I have ###. Iâ€™ve been targeted and discriminated against and Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s going to ruin me.43494.64375 It is unlikely that the employer would disclose that type of information to prospective employers. Most employers have a policy of only releasing dates of employment and job titles. If the employer were to be found releasing such claims the employer would be subject to getting sued for slander. 43494.6736111111 Iâ€™m sorry to hear that this has happened to you. It must be very upsetting to feel you are being accused of stealing. What you need to understand is that unless you have a written employment contract you are considered an employee at will. The significance of at will employment is that you may be discharged at anytime and for any reason or even no reason at all.  The only thing that an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon you being a member of a protected class (race, age, sex, religion, national origin or disability). As a consequence, being discharged due to a cash shortage with you accessing another personâ€™s ### is perfectly legal and permissible. If you have evidence that the real reason for discharging you is due to your disability then you may have a case of discrimination but nothing in your post supports such a conclusion. 43494.6652777778 Thank you so much for the information. I have actually gone to hr and we are working on resolving the issue. Again thank you so much for now43494.9451388889 There is no such thing as an ### offense."  The employer's policy manual may provide what type of discipline warrants immediate discharge versus ### discipline but virtually every policy I've ever seen for cash ### is fairly harsh.  However even if the employer's policy doesn't provide for immediate discharge it does not change the fact that as an at will employee you can be discharged at any time and for any reason - or even no reason at all.  Accordingly it is not illegal for the employer to discharge you for this reason even if it is against the company's own policy. The ### wrongful ###ination is a ### as it leads people to think that they can pursue a case if the reason for the discharge was wrong.  That is not what the ### means.  It is limited to cases of:Illegal Discrimination (employment decisions based upon a person being a member of a protected class - race sex age religion national origin or disability);Retaliation for either pursuing legal rights protected by law (FMLA ### Workers Compensation etc.) or for ### (reporting illegal conduct to the authorities).If it does not fall into one of the above categories then it is not wrongful ###ination."43494.8631944444 What happens if they try and put the missing money on my employment record and it keeps me from getting a mother job? I donâ€™t want my good name ruined due to something I had nothing to do with? Thatâ€™s my main concern, I donâ€™t want my job back43494.66875 What if I find out it was a ### offense? I was never written up for the problem. 43494.6819444444 I have been forced into doing my supervisors duties. I have gone to ###. After over ###. In response I have been the target of anger and backlash. Yesterday I got ambushed with a conference call asking if I wanted to keep my job, because I am ### the business by not doing my immediate supervisors duties. I am in possession of emails and recordings. Should I ask for a face to face meeting with all the supervisors, or should I retain a lawyer?43502.625 No my boss is under a contract to operate ### ### ###.  I have been doing all operations for ### ###. I also went to ###.  They offered an asst. Manager spot with no raise in pay I declined, refrained from doing the job for ###.  43502.69375 No she is salary with bonuses. I just went to my bosses and explained that everytime I try to stop she doesn't do her job. If I dont do it there will be no schedule no truck. When I finally refrained my fears came true and no schedule no truck. My supervisors told me to stop, it was her job. Yet now that I have stopped im a problem. Scheduled to run a shift by myself. Not making a fun work environment43502.7027777778 So the fact that when I stopped we ran out of food. Not being paid for job duties that are contractual is not illegal?  This is  a corporation in multiple states.  Thank you for your help.43502.6798611111 So you are merely referring to the employerâ€™s contractual obligations to a customer. That will have no bearing on your issue and you will still be responsible for performing whatever job duties your employer assigns you. I donâ€™t blame you for being unhappy about being given additional responsibility without being compensated. However if managed correctly it could result in greater pay down the line. 43502.7 What makes you think your job duties are contractual? If you are referring to the job description provided by the employer that is not contractual - merely a description of what job duties you are typically expected to perform - with no legal limitation as to what you can be asked to do.If you are working pursuant to a written employment contract then you are not an at will employee but generally that only applies to highly paid executives or union employees. Are you in a union? If so, then you may have additional protections. If not, then the law is as I described it in my original response. 43502.6881944444 You havenâ€™t identified anything that is illegal so Iâ€™m not sure what you would need a lawyer for at this point. I can appreciate that you may not like doing your supervisorâ€™s job duties for him/her but it is not illegal for the employer to ask you to perform those duties. It is also perfectly within the employerâ€™s rights to take disciplinary action against you for refusing to perform those duties. What you need to understand is that you are an at will employee and as such you may be discharged at anytime and for any reason or even no reason at all. The only thing an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon you being a member of a protected class (race, sex, age, religion, national origin or disability).43502.6763888889 That sounds like you potentially have a viable sexual harassment employment case. What you need to do is contact a local employment attorney that primarily represents claimants (employees) to discuss your options. Many such attorneys handle these cases on a contingency fee basis so it will not cost you anything out of pocket. What you need to understand is that there are very short time frames associated with these cases which, if not met, will preclude you from pursuing your case. In other words, act promptly. 43502.68125 The store manager sent naked photos of her to ny phone and when things didnt go well she cut my days and then fired me after I complained to the store owner and corporate43502.6548611111 Since I wasn't interested and also complained to ### store owner my days were cut short and shortly I was fired43502.6569444444 Hello,I'm currently suspended from work facing termination for a false sexual harassment claim. As background, I'm a manager at a ### business located in ### Summit, MO and the accuser is a ### old girl who has a history of making false accusations against managers and other staff (that they're racist, ###, abusing drugs, etc.) that has already resulted in two other managers being ### in the past ### (I've only worked there that long so I can't verify any further rumors). One of those two managers in question attempted to fire her before being fired HIMSELF, but was unsuccessful (our upper management is very dysfunctional and the VP of the franchise and the girl are in frequent communication). I have numerous pieces of physical evidence as well as footage from our locations security cameras that can be pulled in my defense to show that it was in fact HER that was ### with ME (touching, offering to have a threesome with her and/or my girlfriend, writing affectionate notes, ### me on Facebook, saying she likes older men, etc.), all while she was in a relationship with another ### old girl who is on staff (she is bisexual).I assume this happened because her girlfriend found out about all of this and accused her of cheating and threatened to break up with her, so now the ### old accuser is trying to accuse me to get out of being caught and dumped.Ordinarily I'd rely on upper management to be a fair and neutral third party and that eventually the investigation would reveal that I'm innocent, but after speaking the the two now ###, apparently the VP had been telling them to fire me for MONTHS, but thankfully they refused (as a result of which the first senior manager put in his two weeks notice and then was promptly fired the next day in retaliation).This girl is a ### and needs to be stopped before she does this ### to anyone else, and I can't rely on upper management to doing anything about it - What should I do?43507.8152777778 I'm sorry to hear that you are in such a spot.  Unfortunately, there is no legal basis to protect you from being fired if management chooses to do so and that is not a wrongful termination.  You are almost certainly an at will employee.  As such, you can be discharged at any time and for any reason - or even no reason at all.  The only thing that an employer may not do is make an employment decision based upon you being a member of a protected class.  The protected classes are race, age, religion, national origin, sex or disability.  Since you would be discharged for alleged sexual harassment that is a perfectly permissible basis to discharge - even if the employer is wrong!While it does appear that this girl is a piece of work that should be stopped, I just don't think that you are likely to be successful in doing so if upper management was trying to get rid of you even before this.  I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but that is the reality.43507.91875 I worked ###. I became ill with severe irritable ### syndrome in 2011. I had many hours of sick & annual leave they let me use while promising I was a valued employee they didn't want to lose. I was a crew leader for a prison work van. I was in a rural area so we didn't have ### ### & we didn't pull a trailer with one. We were expected to go to the ### area along the highway leaving our prisoners unattended. I asked to work at the county shed while seeking medical care, and not be out on the highway, this was allowed for a time. I asked multiple times for a toilet on my crew assignment. I was stalled and never received any help. I was put back out on the road & due to this I began to have panic attacks. This became very debilitating for me. After all of my leave was depleted I was forced to give up my ###. Now all highway crews with ###  have a trailer with a toilet, due to my disability they corrected this shortly thereafter. I didn't sue at the time but I haven't been able to get my disability approved and I am barely surviving. I have been under continued medical care but I continue to suffer and now have severe depression along with ### and panic issues. It's been ###. I understand It is ###. According to the ### defines a person with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities and includes major bodily functions such as digestive, & ### functions. I don't feel social security is considering the limitations on my life in approving me for disability benefits. I would appreciate any help or guidance you can give me. Thank You. 43510.8277777778 Thank you, appreciate your quick response 43511.6104166667 The statute of limitations for employment related claims is two (###) years so you are long past the time when you could have taken any action on your situation.  Employees like yourself virtually never have written employment contracts unless they are union collective bargaining agreements.  While the statute of limitations for a written contract is going to be ten (10) years, that is only going to be for actions based on the contract itself - not claims of discrimination associated with the employment related to the union ###.Sorry that you are having a difficult time.  If you are seeking disability then you really should have an attorney as it is a long and difficult process in which you really need representation.43510.8854166667 I literally cried when I read your reply. I sincerely appreciate your help. Thank you very much. -###43521.0666666667 I work for a privately owned company, ### Dollar City. Do I have a legal right to tell them that I want to go to Church and I am not able to work until service is over. They are refusing to allow me the ability to go to Church. I am willing to come in as soon as church services are over but they are not willing to give me that time off. Thank you. 43510.9902777778 You are free to make that a condition of working there and ### Dollar City is them free to tell you that you no longer work there. As a private company it has no obligation to accommodate your church service. While the employer may not discriminate against you based upon your religion, that doesnâ€™t mean it must accommodate you unless it is accommodating employees of other religions. 43511.7409722222 Iâ€™m sorry to hear that you are going through this as it must be very frustrating. I note that you say you should be paid for your last week working as well as the following week (the remainder of your notice period) along with the overtime hours which were missing. Just so you know the employer may agree to pay you for the balance of your notice and not have you work it but it isnâ€™t obligated to pay for it. You can simply be let go immediately without paying you for the time not worked. Accordingly you may not be entitled to pay for that week. Unfortunately there isnâ€™t any easy way to get this resolved and contacting the DOL or an attorney are really the only options.  If you are certain you didnâ€™t get paid for the OT then you can probably find an attorney to assist you on a contingency fee basis so there is no out of pocket on your end. 43514.8013888889 My recent employer refused to put my pay on ADP for me to view. When I did get print record from office manager it shows no extra hours I worked outside of my ###. I was to receive time and one-half $22.### ###. I asked for my pay to be given to me but have not received an answer. I gave two weeks notice but one week into was asked to leave. My total pay that should have been given me was my current pay plus my next weekâ€™s pay plus the extra time I worked and was not paid. What recourse do I have outside of contacting Mo Dept of Labor and an attorney. I am a widow on a small budget and this is a significant amount to me. 43514.7791666667 Thank you so much for your response. I have done the correct leg work thus far. Hope ### out for all ###. Sincerely,### ### 43514.8659722222 You are almost certainly an at-will employee.  As such, you can be discharged at any time and for any reason, or even no reason at all.  So if the employer discharged you based upon allegations about your actions that is perfectly permissible.  That is true even if it can be conclusively established that the employer was wrong about the underlying facts.  The only thing that an employer may not do is make employment decision based upon you being a member of a protected class.  The protected classes are: race, age, sex, religion, national origin and disability.  So for there to be a case of wrongful termination there must be some evidence that the employer's actions were based upon you being in one of those protected classes.There is a common misconception that general harassment, sometimes referred to as a hostile work environment" is a legitimate basis for an employment claim.  The error comes from the fact that those terms are used to identify a form of sexual harassment but are not applicable generally.  In order for you to have a claim for wrongful termination you must be able to show that you were discharged because you were a member of a protected class. There is one other basis for a wrongful termination claim - retaliation.  However the retaliation must be for you asserting your legal rights or for ###.  So if you are fired for filing for leave under FMLA; a reasonable accommodation under the ###; made a worker's compensation claim; submitted a report of illegal discrimination (based upon a protected class); or reported illegal activities of the employer to the legal authorities then you could have a wrongful termination claim.  Note that retaliation for your claim of harassment by this other employee does not qualify as a claim of illegal discrimination unless you can show that the harassment was based upon you being in a protected class.So after reading the above what leads you to believe that you have a claim for wrongful termination?  In other words what protected class do you believe you fall into that was the basis for either the original ### actions or the employer's subsequent actions against you?  What evidence do you have to prove that the actions were based upon your race age sex religion national origin or disability?If you can establish the above then you may well have a viable case and you should seek an attorney that routinely represents employees in employment cases to handle your case for you.  It is important to remember that these cases have very short timeframes with which to take certain actions so do not wait to meet with an attorney or you may find that you are no longer able to pursue your claim.Best of luck to you."43515.975 i alerted my managers of harassment and nothing was ever done. When I set up a meeting with my managers, i requested to not work the same days as the harasser and they agreed to put her on opposite days. Thatâ€™s following week of the change she retaliated by going  I HR and making false accusations of my character and events that did not happen. I tried to call the area director and he never respond to four different calls from me. I also called HR to understand why was me being threatened to be assaulted by her family members on their property ok. They decided to terminate me for inappropriate behavior that i never displayed. I was lied on and betrayed to be someone I never acted like or portrayed at work or outside of work. 43515.7701388889 Double check to make sure that it wasn't already taken out.  That would have been the better route as it ensures that you are covered and don't have to worry about it.  If the 10% wasn't held back there is no special place for you to keep the funds.Those funds were not a pension as that is a payment from an employer once you have retired.  As for ### accessing your bank account it does not have any such legal right to do so nor would it engage in such a practice as it is not related to its function.  You are entitled to unemployment benefits if you lost your job through no fault of your own even if you are ### Gates and have a ton of assets.43517.7013888889 I was laid off from my job- last date of work was ###.  I have been receiving unemployment checks through Unemployment. I had some medical bills - out of pocket costs from last year for both my children and I's care that I haven't been able to pay off and they wanted them in lump sums. I decided the only way I would be able to pay them in my current situation or near future is to withdrawal from my ### (b) account- despite the fees and penalties so that I could pay these bills. My check was deposited yesterday and as I began paying bills it occurred to me- is this reportable as income to unemployment?  Will my unemployment benefits be stopped due to this?  I don't believe I will be able to live off of this amt for long and was planning on using the brunt of it for the medical bills and electric ### payments I would be otherwise unable to pay with just the unemployment.  Also, I will need to save the 10% penalty back for taxes at the end of this year so that I hope that is not considered earned income- or where I need to keep it. I had just figured it was like a severance payment and not reportable as income (as this is how I kind of viewed it). 43517.6486111111 I'm sorry that you are having to go through this difficult time as I know how hard it can be.  There should be no impact on your unemployment as these were your funds not income from wages.  However, you should not have gone this route as those funds were protected from any creditors and you will need them in your retirement.

I know it was not a light decision but one I felt like I needed to make. I had originally hoped it would qualify as a "hardship" distribution but it seems like from the paperwork that my plan did not qualify for that after I was no longer an active employee. I am also concerned that DSS and/or unemployment is going to look at my bank account and get the wrong idea about it all.  Is there any way to prevent this? Is there anywhere special I should hold the 10% I will have to pay in at the end of the year?"43517.6930555556 Due to language doctor used filing out paper work such has chronic back pain.

Yes any doctor can fill out paper work. I am working on referral for second opinion. My current neurosurgeon will not fill out anything because they where not the first doctor to take me off work.

I'd like to know what you think. I lost my ### to practice law due to poverty. Do you think that that is right? I think it is in violation of the Fourteenth ### Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. We talk a lot about access to our courts and have filings without fees, or at reduced fees. I can't practice my profession. The Bar has been no help. Please give your thoughts.###.PS It goes without saying that my failure to pay dues is the only reason I can't practice. I was always in good standing. 43546.0451388889 At my telephone hearing with appeals tribunal if employment security division, the referee allowed evidence to be admitted even though I objected to and did not receive a copy before hand. This evidence directly effects the case as it is copy of  policy I violated. I admitted to being aware of policy but was trying to prove itâ€™s not legal or fairly enforced and not available to refer to but referee cut me off and gave ###.Now I have case filed with southern district appeals court but Iâ€™m not sure how to reflect in my brief these issues while sticking strictly to law. Iâ€™m also confused as the referee gave an extremely specific definition about first hand knowledge and that my witnesses werenâ€™t worth calling but the rep. For my employer did not fit in his criteria and was not witness to any of the events and gave a different answer every time asked what my discharge was about. How did all these things get overlooked by so many officials or am I wrong? I was discharged for misconduct and I know there have been revisions to this statute but I definitely donâ€™t deserve misconduct by any stretch of the word. I was sick and went home after ###â€™t answer my call. Before this I hadnâ€™t missed any days, had recently been given a raise and promotion. I need that unemployment as Iâ€™m not highly employable or skilled as fast food workers are a dime a dozen and I worked very hard but I donâ€™t dispute discharge just denial of benefits43554.2743055556 If the employer showed that it made a reasonable effort to get the policy to you that would be sufficient. More importantly you said you admitted being aware of the policy so that concludes that issue. As you noted, the statute was significantly amended in ###. Accordingly whether or not you believe that your actions amount to misconduct generally is of no consequence if the statutory definition says it is misconduct.Without knowing what the allegations are itâ€™s difficult for me to say if they are valid or if your assertions have merit. You were trying to show that the policy wasnâ€™t legal but it is exceedingly unlikely that the policy was illegal. Iâ€™ve handled over ###,###. Whether or not the policy was fairly and consistently enforced is a legitimate argument but you must be able to show that the employer was aware of the policy violations to show unfair or inconsistent enforcement. Simply stating that ### has done the same thing many times is meaningless unless you also can show that management was aware of the policy violations at the time. Management canâ€™t be guilty of unfair or inconsistent enforcement if management wasnâ€™t aware of the violations. As for your witnesses, the Tribunal will never allow someone to testify about the exact same things that you already testified about as that is corroborating testimony. As for anything else that your witnesses could testify about they must have firsthand knowledge. While the employer witness may not have had firsthand knowledge about all that he/she testified about that would be permissible to the extent the testimony was based upon business records. You should also know that while the appeals so far have been designed to allow a layperson to do them the court of appeals will require strict compliance with the legal rules. Easily 95% of the appeals Iâ€™ve seen by claimants have ended up just being dismissed by the court for failure to follow the courtâ€™s rules.Most importantly, if you are desperate for the benefits as you stated you should know that the appeal to the court of appeals is not like the appeals youâ€™ve already done. This process wonâ€™t be done in a short time but rather a year from now. You need to focus on finding work far more than this appeal.43554.7104166667 I recently walked out on my job at McDonald's due to ###. One of the employees mom and aunt both work there and have been there for ### so I felt i had no manager to actually go to. I have a bi racial daughter and my husband is black. Would this be some type of law suit. I lost my job due to me walking out.43559.6833333333 Who did you report this to before quitting? While what you describe might be a basis for a claim you must have given the employer an opportunity to address the issue before quitting. Just quitting denies the employer any chance of correcting the problem. 43559.7131944444 Hello there. Last summer I was laid off of my hotel position due to decline in travelers because of the pandemic. My school district was back and forth with my union on whether to reopen schools when Covid cases were high (our peaceful protest was on the news). During that same time I became a caregiver for my younger brother who have heart failure. It was difficult to find open places (due to stay at home orders) or work-from- home positions that could accommodate my restricted schedule because my brother needed continuous care (I was feeding and ### him at the time). I applied for unemployment and was approved. I was fully ### on my application and placed both employers and positions on there. My employment was verified and I was approved to receive benefits. I never received a call about my employers until months later. A guy stated that I had reasonable assurance" ( I didn't have a clue what that meant-I had to Google it) and told me to stop claiming benefits when I started work which I did.  School eventually started ###. I stopped claiming benefits. Soon after I received an overpayment of benefits notice and that I owe over $###.  Another notice stated that I had reasonable assurance and that the decision was no fault of mine. My question is why didn't they just deny the benefits from the beginning? Did anyone actually verify my employers? If "reasonable assurance" was mentioned when I informed them I was a teacher I would have sold my clothes or did whatever I needed to do to take care of my brother and children. My children reside with their father so thankfully I didn't have to worry about food except for when they're with me. I filed an appeal on this decision. Division of security already filed a Certificate of Assessment with the local court and is now sending garnishment notices. I called and was told that the division is backlogged on appeals and is working on the ### (mine is ###20). I was also informed to not worry about the notices or court filing: they do that automatically and it's not processed unless the hearing doesn't go well.  Is there any way I can combat this when my hearing arrives? With this pandemic I wasn't sure if there would be work to return to so I had to do what was necessary for my family. It feels like being a teacher something I love to be is hurting me more financially than any other job I ever had. Any assistance or suggestions you have will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking time to read this. "44232.2729166667 No need to apologize at all. You are only trying to help me see the ### of this situation and I appreciate you for that. More than you know. I will ask the referee to remand the matter. Thank you for volunteering your time, not just for me, for everyone you have helped. I wish you much success and an abundance of blessings. Take care. 44239.3493055556 The fact that only the school employment makes perfect sense as that is the only employment that was seemingly an issue. You need to understand that ### does not look at your whole situation but rather each employer separately. If there is an issue with one employer then you will receive paperwork on that employer regarding the issue. There would be no reason to talk about the hotel employment if there were no problems with that employer regarding eligibility.Ordinarily, you would not be entitled to benefits as a result of the loss of hotel employment based upon the statute I provided in my prior response. While I do not profess to know the reasoning for the statutory provision, I suspect that it is based upon the notion that education employees are deemed to be paid for a full year's worth of work despite being off for the Summer. That makes sense since teachers still have to eat and pay bills all year long even if they aren't in class for ###-###. However, if teachers are being paid for a full year's worth of work and simply having ### off then from an economic standpoint they aren't really unemployed during the Summer off. While it is customary for many teachers to get interim jobs during the summer months to supplement their income, those jobs are not going to be the basis for unemployment benefits since educational employees have a reasonable assurance of going back to work in the Fall.The CARES Act passed last ### provided for increased benefits of $### (PUA) for those that otherwise didn't qualify for unemployment but nevertheless did lose employment due to the pandemic. I suspect that contrary to your assertion that you received PUA benefits, that you did not in fact receive them. The extra $###. PUA benefits would only be granted to those that didn't qualify for benefits under the normal rules but still lost employment due to the pandemic. That is your precise situation. At your appeals hearing the Appeals Referee is likely to limit the discussion to whether or not you were entitled to benefits under the normal rules without any discussion of PUA. The reason is that the hearing will only cover the issue listed on the Notice of Telephone Hearing. Anything not related to the issue on the notice cannot be addressed in the hearing as it isn't legally before the Appeals Tribunal. What will almost certainly happen is that you will be denied since you aren't actually entitled to benefits under the normal rules. What you must do is bring out that you worked for a hotel during the summer and lost that employment due to the pandemic. Finally, at the end of the hearing, YOU MUST ASK THE APPEALS REFEREE TO REMAND THE MATTER TO A DIVISION DEPUTY FOR A DETERMINATION ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE ENTITLED TO PUA BENEFITS DUE TO THE LOSS OF THE HOTEL EMPLOYMENT.Sorry for putting it in all caps but I wanted to make sure that you recognize how critical it is that you tell the Appeals Referee to remand this for a PUA determination. If you fail to do that you will be out of luck unless the Referee thinks to do it on his/her own. 44236.7222222222 The reasonable assurance issue deals with the normal situation where a teacher is off for the summer as the natural part of being a teacher and they are not entitled to unemployment for the summer. So to the extent that you claimed benefits for weeks during the summer when you would normally be off as part of your normal work schedule as a teacher, those weeks are going to be denied. I'm guessing that you are taking the position that you normally get other work during the summer months to supplement your income. Unfortunately, I am not aware of any legal basis for an entitlement to benefits on that basis in light of the statutory exclusion for teachers of reasonable assurance. That statutory language is contained in the following statute beginning with Â§ ###:###00065288.040.  Eligibility for benefits â€” exceptions â€” report, contents. â€” ###000487.  A claimant who is unemployed and has been de###ined to be an insured worker shall be eligible for benefits for any week only if the deputy finds that:(###000652)  The claimant is able to work and is available for work.  No person shall be deemed available for work unless such person has been and is actively and earnestly seeking work.  Upon the filing of an initial or renewed claim, and prior to the filing of each weekly claim thereafter, the deputy shall notify each claimant of the number of work search contacts required to constitute an active search for work.  Unless the deputy directs otherwise, a claimant shall make a minimum of three work search contacts during any week for which he or she claims benefits.  No person shall be considered not available for work, pursuant to this subdivision, solely because he or she is a substitute teacher or is on jury duty. ###.  (###000487)  Benefits based on service in employment" described in subsections ### ### ###00065288.0###4 shall be payable in the same amount on the same ###s and subject to the same conditions as compensation payable on the basis of other service subject to this law; except that:(a)  With respect to service performed in an instructional research or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution benefits shall not be paid based on such services for any week of unemployment commencing during the period between two successive academic years or ###s or during a similar period between two regular but not successive ###s or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the individual's contract to any individual if such individual performs such services in the first of such academic years (or ###s) and if there is a contract or a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform services in any such capacity for any educational institution in the second of such academic years or ###s;(b)  With respect to services performed in any capacity (other than instructional research or principal administrative capacity) for an educational institution benefits shall not be paid on the basis of such services to any individual for any week which commences during a period between two successive academic years or ###s if such individual performs such services in the first of such academic years or ###s and there is a contract or a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services in the second of such academic years or ###s;(c)  With respect to services described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subdivision benefits shall not be paid on the basis of such services to any individual for any week which commences during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if such individual performed such services in the period immediately before such vacation period or holiday recess and there is reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services immediately following such vacation period or holiday recess;(d)  With respect to services described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subdivision benefits payable on the basis of services in any such capacity shall be denied as specified in paragraphs (a) (b) and (c) of this subdivision to any individual who performed such services at an educational institution while in the employ of an educational service agency and for this purpose the ### "educational service agency" means a governmental agency or governmental entity which is established and operated exclusively for the purpose of providing such services to one or more educational institutions.(###000652)  If compensation is denied for any week pursuant to paragraph (b) or (d) of subdivision (###000487) of this subsection to any individual performing services at an educational institution in any capacity (other than instructional research or principal administrative capacity) and such individual was not offered an opportunity to perform such services for the second of such academic years or ###s such individual shall be entitled to a retroactive payment of the compensation for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim for compensation and for which compensation was denied solely by reason of paragraph (b) or (d) of subdivision (###000487) of this subsection.Additionally you are likely to have a problem due to the fact that you were not available for work as defined by the statute since you were caring for your brother. As you acknowledged above your "restricted schedule" interfered with your ability to secure employment. The Missouri Division of Employment Security (###) looks at whether or not you would be able to accept employment if it was offered. Things like going to school or caring for a loved one that makes it difficult to be able to accept employment are considered to show that you are not "available" for work under the statute. The relevant provision of the same statute is above in Â§ ###000487.That said the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits provided for under the CARES Act may provide relief for you. Unfortunately the way that ### has approached these is to tackle everything through the normal process first and only address the PUA afterward. I would press that you were entitled to PUA due to the hotel job being shut down due to COVID-###0004879."44232.7402777778 Yes, that is correct: I would normally seek employment to supplement income during the summer months. I did receive PUA benefits, but they are including that in the determination as well. In the mail notices, none of them even mentioned the hotel job, only my teaching one. So it seems as if they based their decision solely on my Board of Education employer. That's weird because the online application accepted my hotel employer and documentation that supported why I was laid off. When I have this hearing, the only thing that I can argue is the PUA benefits correct? There isn't anything else that can be done since this wasn't a normal situation? 44235.3125 You are welcome and I'm happy to help when I can. Best of luck to you.44239.6284722222 My work fired me on my off day and called me the next day to fire me over the phone. They stated my schedule was no longer working for them after it was approved months ago and no one said anything to me about it needing to be changed or wrote out any termination papers. The weird thing about this is no one in the front business office knew I was fired and neither did human resources. They found in the system it said terminated but there was nothing stating why on file. I have worked there since ### ###'t know why I am really being fired. I even got a text two weeks ago from my boss stating that she changed the schedule around for the holiday and sent me a screenshot of it stating after this one it would go back to normal. Can I take legal action ? That doesn't seem like protocol to me?.. very confused..43575.1069444444 Thank you. 43575.1402777778 Unless you were a union employee you were an at will employee. As such you could be discharged at anytime and for any reason or even no reason at all. The only thing an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon you being a member of a protected class (race, age, sex, religion, national origin or disability).  So unless you believe (and have evidence to support that belief) that the discharge was due to you being a member of a protected class you donâ€™t have any legal basis to sue. If you feel there is such evidence then you should arrange to meet with a local employment attorney that primarily represents employees to fully discuss your case. 43575.1395833333 An employer is permitted to use whatever criteria it wishes in deciding whom it will hire provided that criteria is not based upon the job applicant being a member of a protected class.  The protected classes are limited to race, religion, sex, age, national origin or disability.  The class of those individuals with a prior criminal record is not a protected class so the employer is perfectly within its rights to deny you employment.  No doubt it is extremely frustrating to be denied employment based upon something so far back in your past.  While I can certainly appreciate your frustration, there simply isn't anything that can be done about it from an employment law standpoint. The only thing I can suggest is the possibility of getting the conviction expunged from your record.  You didn't indicate the nature of what is on your record.  Some things can be expunged whereas others cannot.  Quite frankly, I do not do expungments so I wouldn't know if it were an expungeable matter or not.  What I recommend is that you search for a lawyer that does expungments and speak with him/her to see if you can obtain some relief there to make life easier for you going forward.Best of luck to you.43581.7069444444 Can a job not hire me for something that showed up pn my record something that that happen  over ### ?43581.4840277778 I can appreciate that you are not pleased with the ultimate outcome reached but I see no ethical issues associated with what you describe.  Just because the individual in question had legal training did not alter the nature of the relationship as you knew that they were acting on behalf of the employer and therefore adverse to you.  As far as your union is concerned, a union has no obligation to provide legal counsel for you at its expense. 43584.6527777778 If an employee has been subject to an major adverse action by being given a proposal for dismissal by a ### and also been instructed that they have to respond to the proposed action and communicate through a certian ### agency representative then after the dismissal has been sustained and acted upon then the employee finds out that the agency representative he was required to communicate with is in fact an attorney, then is/was there an ethical obligation for the designated agency representative or the agency itself  to divulge that the employee representative has  had legal training? What if that representative was issued the discretion to draw up paperwork concerning the dismissal such as a stay or last chance agreement? Would ethics dictate that this would need be revealed so that the employee could make an informed decision wether or not to be represented by their own counsel? Also if there were a union involved would they be obligated to provide an attorney so the employee would be on equal ground to negotiate in their own best interest? Whats the law for matters like this and then what is common practice in everyday life?43584.0916666667 Good Afternoon, My company that I was employed at for three years and three months; ### Portfolio Debt Equities, recently laid off 75% of the company, including myself. I feel as though I was discriminated against and not kept as a current employee due to my ###. I was employed as the Client Services Supervisor; highest paid and most ### employee in my office. ### chose to let me go but kept ### $###. Two of the employees I hired directly and ###. I was cross trained on all job functions and should not have been let go, as I was a staple of knowledge for the office. I feel as if I was chosen to be laid off due to my approved maternity leave schedule for ### ###-17, ###. With a staff of only four hourly employees after the company lay off, I would not be able to contribute to the remaining office tasks with my approved vacation or maternity leave. I also fell as if I was let go to save the company money on my hourly wage along with maternity benefits payout. Can you confirm if I have a case? Please feel free to contact me at ###-### with any questions. Best, ### ###43595.8791666667 Ms. ###While you may very well have been chosen for layoff because of your pregnancy, I did not see any specific evidence of it in what you wrote.  The fact that you were part of a larger layoff is not helpful.  Being the highest paid in the office is also a negative, and would make economic sense if the company is trying to reduce costs via the ###.   It isn't possible for an attorney on this forum to speculate about your potential pregnancy discrimination claim.  While you could confer with an employment attorney first, you will likely be advised to file your complaint with the EEOC first as required.  The attorney can review the specific evidence you have to support your claim.  After you file with the EEOC, an attorney can request a right to sue" letter from the EEOC to expedite moving your case to court.  A "right to sue" letter simply means that the EEOC is closing its file and you now can file a lawsuit.  It does not mean you have a good case or any case at all.If you believe your employer has discriminated against you because of your pregnancy you can file a charge of discrimination with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In fact you must file a charge if you want to file a discrimination lawsuit; it's a legal requirement.To file a charge you must provide some basic information about yourself your employer and what happened that you believe was discriminatory. You must file the charge within ###(s). If a state or local agency enforces a pregnancy discrimination law this time limit is extended to ###. Once the EEOC gets your charge it will send a copy to your employer. The EEOC may invite you and your employer to mediate the dispute may investigate your claims or may even litigate on your behalf (this is extremely rare). If it decides you missed the deadline for filing a charge or it doesn't have jurisdiction over your claims the EEOC may dismiss them.  ###The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function here:  ###Best wishes."43595.9354166667 So essentially your basis for contending you were wrongfully terminated is that you can prove that you didnâ€™t do what the employer said you did, correct?  Unfortunately, that is not what a wrongful termination is based upon. As an at will employee you can be discharged at anytime and for any reason or even no reason at all. So the fact that the employer was wrong about the reason (or even blatantly fabricated the reason) is immaterial to a wrongful discharge case. What you need to understand is that the only thing that an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon you being a member of a protected class (race, age, sex, religion, national origin or disability) or in retaliation for you asserting legal protected rights (FMLA, ###, Work Comp, etc.).  If you were fired for one of those reasons you might have a wrongful termination case but simply being fired for a bogus reason is not a wrongful termination case. If you have reason to believe that your discharge was due to you being a member of a protected class or in retaliation for asserting legally protected right such as FMLA then you should contact a local employment attorney that primarily represents employees to discuss your case. 43597.2965277778 So, they say I was Live ###" in the establishment on my day off not in uniform or anything. ###: I have video evidence I wasn't live ### in the facility and ###: they say I was due to my set up.

As for the individualâ€™s liability, you likely donâ€™t have much of a case due to the fact that Missouri eliminated per se slander back in the ###.

The type of case you are representing yourself on is very complex and there are many deadlines associated with such a case.  I would strongly advise you to reach out to lawyers that handle these types of cases to attempt to get representation.  Most of them handle these cases on a contingency basis.  I no longer handle these types of cases but I certainly can get you in touch with the right people.  Since you are in ### County, I would recommend contacting ### (National Employment Lawyers Association), ### City Chapter.  I may be able to get a few names for you as well.  If you have previously been turned down from an attorney, ask at least three others.  Another attorney may have a different outlook on your case. There are several different meanings to the ### agent" in the law.  From your documents attached I believe you are referring to the company's "registered agent." A registered agent is a person you can serve a copy of the Petition to and that person or entity will get the document to the proper people.  Service to this ### is legally binding on the company. If this is what you are looking for then you need to look on the Missouri Secretary of State's Website (Missouri Secretary of State).  There you can search business entities and get the name of the registered agent and address for the company to serve.  You would then need to request a summons from the court to serve a copy of your Petition to the registered agent for the company.  I would recommend that you have it served by ### County's Sheriff's Department but they will have a fee for doing so. They can walk you through how to do this and make sure it is done properly. Here is a link the to the rules on Summons' and obtaining service: Rule 54.   Once they have been served they will have ###.  You will then get an attorney to contact and send your discovery requests to.  Again I would strongly recommend you get counsel on this type of case.  They are difficult for even the lawyers who have expertise in this area of law.  I hope this information is helpful to you.  If after reading this you have questions about this issue or if you would like for me to assist you with finding an attorney that may be interested in helping you please feel free to respond. Good Luck!  ### R. ###"43605.7256944444 Normally, the company would designate a person to answer the discovery.  It is normally someone in human resources, a vice president or other corporate executive.  You do not need to name an employee to answer the questions for the company.    Adding an employee as a party is a much different situation, especially in a case like this.  The Statute in Missouri recently changed and depending on whether your case falls before the changes or after the changes can greatly change the answer to this question.  There is a lot of information that I do not have to help you on this.   I will get you in touch with a few lawyers in your area to talk with.  Hopefully they will be able to assist you.  As soon as I have a few names I will reach back out. 43605.8034722222 Thank you so much Ms. ###, I need the employees (these persons are what I was ###  agents") to answer the interrogatories.  Is there a Petition I need to submit to add them to the lawsuit in order to get my ### answered?  from what I understand I cannot they are not "party" to the lawsuit  (yet) and do not have to ### the interrogatories. Their answers are very vital to the caseRespectfully ### ###"43605.7868055556 Thanks again for yor help.  I understnd it would be hard to add persons to the case, but can I get my ### answered by the registered agent on file.  I can pose the me questions to him and he would have to supply the answer.  Is this correct 43608.2395833333 This is an employment law matter.  I was discriminated against by an agent of a corporation becasue I am disabled.  I endured extreme amounts of ### to the point I was forced to quit (Constructive discharge).  The corporations agents in authority failed to act to protect me the employee.  Therefore, I am suing the corporation, but in order to get my discovery (evidence) I need to name the agents as part of the suit and sue them as well in order to get  my interrogatories answered. I have ### / name them43605.6604166667 Yes, it ### be very helpful if you could get some names of attorneys that would accept my case on a contingency basis to assist me.43605.7930555556 My employer has had me filling in" as a general manager for close to ###. I have been fulfilling all duties of this role on top of the duties of my own role. Despite receiving no training for the ### role I have been repeatedly reprimanded for not performing the tasks at the standard they would expect from a trained ###. I am also reprimanded for not performing duties that the ### can perform but that an employee in my role cannot. I am the employee that all other employees recognize as the person in charge and am also the person that the ###s at other store reach out to for assistance. I currently receive none of the benefits a ### receives and am still paid only for my previous role which is barely half of what the other ###s make.I have applied for the open ### position but after several months have not received an interview. I feel that if I can be asked to fill the role for half a year now then they should be able to pay me for it or at least allow me to interview for the position. I find it ridiculous that I can continuously perform the role while not being allowed to make an attempt at the hiring process for the role.The company I work for also refused to find our store coverage to help cover management duties and also threatens to write us up if we receive overtime. Due the ### position being salaried I often cannot perform both the duties of the role I'm paid for and the ### role within the ###. My current supervisor threatens to write me up if I don't get the tasks done but also threatens to write me up if I stay late to finish them. This causes me to frequently have to work off the clock to avoid punishment. I plan to file a complaint about being forced to work off the clock but is there any action I can take related to them forcing me to fill a role I'm not compensated for?"43619.7659722222 The employer is free to change the terms and conditions of employment at any time just as you are free to accept or reject those changed terms.  I would agree that it sounds unfair for the employer to expect you to perform all of those job duties without compensating you or at least strongly considering you for the job.  However, the law does not require that an employer treat you fairly so I'm afraid that you have no legal remedy for that aspect.It is illegal to work off the clock so you should not be doing that.  If the employer has expressly instructed you to work off the clock that is a serious problem and it can be sued or audited by the US DOL for violating the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  Because of that most employers have strict policies ### any work off the clock and will fire an employee for doing so. If your manager is expressly instructing you to work off the clock then you have a good case but if the manager is just complaining about you not getting everything done and telling you that you can't have overtime that isn't the same thing as telling you to work off the clock.  The manager may be expecting you to start delegating your non-### type duties to others so that you are able to complete the ### tasks within the time prescribed.  It may also be that the ### to make you ### is based upon a perception that you have failed to engage in such delegation thus far. One of the most difficult transitions is to a management role in the same facility in which a person has been working alongside the folks that are now to be supervised.  It may be that your boss is wanting to see you let go of your old responsibilities and start demanding more of your former co-workers so that you can succeed as a ### before considering you in that role.43619.8513888889 FMLA is a federal law that guarantees ###.  During those ###, your employer cannot terminate your employment.  Once those ###, then your employer is no longer required to give you any additional time off.

I have ran out of fmla and now my employer say that I can be terminated if I donâ€™t start coming to work. I have tried every possible solution to where I can stay home with her but I donâ€™t qualify for any. I also talked to childrenâ€™s hospital who said they would not have a problem giving me an extension on my fmla but my employer said it wasnâ€™t possible that I had used up all I was allowed for the year and could not reapply. My only question is are they allowed to do that?43636.7284722222 I truly did not want to leave the families that I supported but feel unsafe working for a company who don't make more stringent guidelines for employees, especially those that are in ### positions to avoid this kind of thing. I had never met this woman face to face and had been professional and respectful everything we had spoken in the phone. What bothers me the most is her readiness to judge my job performance based on the color of my skin is bad to begin with but to share that with a person who don't know me and is ### me to provide care for her family member could have been lethal to my reputation as this company employee was my supervisor43668.1194444444 I work in the Healthcare field and was with this company ###. I had a upper management person make false statements to a family I supported through this company in regards to my professional conduct as well as my race. Is this considered discrimination? I no longer work for that company and am extremely upset that this employee who has never even met me felt comfortable in saying what she did about me.I was fortunate that the family knew she was not correct in what she said but am aware of the possible damage she could have caused for me both on a ### level had the family not known me and seen my work ethics firsthand.43664.9444444444 If the comment was ### but didnâ€™t result in an adverse employment action, then it is not unlawful race discrimination. ### 43668.0694444444 Iâ€™m glad that the statement was not believed.  Defamation cases are tough in Missouri because you must prove â€œactual damage.â€  It doesnâ€™t sound like youâ€™ve suffered ### financial damage as a result of the statement that was not believed.  Here is an example of defamation.  You interview for a job and list a person as a reference.  You are about to get hired but the potential employer calls your reference.  The reference falsely states that you are a drug addict and had been fired for stealing.  Then you donâ€™t get hired.  Thatâ€™s an extreme example but I think you get my point.  I will leave your question open for two days in case you have a follow-up question. 43665.0506944444 Perhaps.  A big challenge would be proving that race was the reason by your employerâ€™s comment.  What proof could you present?43668.1048611111 What defines employment discrimination? If the person used my race as grounds for making negative ### about my work ethics is that considered discrimination? Thank You in advance for your input in this matter.43668.0486111111 Would my choice to leave the company constitute a adverse employment action?43668.1034722222 You may file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC.  Your challenge, however, will be to prove that race was the reason behind your employer's comments.  i don't know if you have other examples to show, because one incident standing alone, when race wasn't mentioned, is tough to link the reason to race.

Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Dept. of ### website:###.   Is it legal for an employer to reduce the wages or number of hours of an hourly employee?  The FLSA requires that all covered non-exempt employees receive at least the applicable Federal minimum wage for all hours worked.   In a week in which employees work overtime, they must receive their regular rate of pay and overtime pay at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for all overtime hours.   The Act does not preclude an employer from lowering an employeeâ€™s hourly rate, provided the rate paid is at least the minimum wage, or from reducing the number of hours the employee is scheduled to work. ###If an employer fails to pay you as required, then you may file a complaint: ###You may also choose to file a complaint with the Missouri Department of Labor (https://labor.mo.gov/DLS/General/owed) although Missouri law has less strength than the federal law.43665.6458333333 I am a pay per visit field clinician with a home health agency, which means I am only paid per each visit I do - like a doctor.

I maintain that I should be paid for each hour because these duties are not subsumed in my regular visit duties, my visits where I was teaching her took longer because I was teaching her, and I passed visits to her so she would be documented as the treating clinician.

If you are and have made complaints that have gone unanswered then you may need to speak with an employment attorney that routinely represents employees. If you are not a racial minority and are simply offended by the statements Iâ€™m not sure you have much standing to assert a claim. If you have been retaliated against as a result of making a complaint you may be able to pursue that even if you wouldnâ€™t have a case directly as a minority. As for seeking help through legal aide I donâ€™t think that they handle employment discrimination cases so you likely would need to hire an employment attorney. Many will take these on a contingency fee basis which means the lawyer gets paid a percentage of your recovery so you wonâ€™t have any out of pocket costs. The first step in any employment case is the filing of a complaint with the EEOC or MHRC because you cannot file a lawsuit against the employer until you exhaust your administrative remedies and get a right to sue letter. I recommend that you try to hire an employment attorney first so that your complaint to the EEOC or MHRC doesnâ€™t end up being a problem later on but you certainly can start by filing the complaint yourself. Good luck. 43682.6402777778 Since being hired I have complained to HR, and the Executive Director about the use of racial and derogatory statements; as well as trying to work the issues out directly with the Director who is targeting me; especially after finding out I had complained about the ### comments made; I have others in office who can complain as well about the way they are treated. . .

I lost my Insurance through the company due to no income.  I filed a complaint with the MCHR and EEOC I do have case files for both.

(a non-profit organization). I received an email on ### from someone who was impersonating my boss asking me to purchase 10 $###. I forwarded the emails to the Financial Manager and asked her what exactly I was supposed to purchase. She told me I could purchase the cards at ###. Believing the email to be from my boss, I went to ### and purchased the gift cards ($###,###). The email stated it was for a charitable donation. The ### of my boss asked me to scratch off the gift cards and send a picture of the numbers to the supervisor of the organization" who was receiving the donation "### ###" at ###-###. Believing the email to be from my boss I sent "### ###" pictures of the gift cards as I was asked.The ### then asked me to purchase ### $###. I went to ### to purchase more gift cards (and luckily ### did not have ###). I returned to work and told my boss that ### was out of EBay gift cards. My boss didn't know what I was talking about. I showed my boss the email thread between "my boss" and I. My boss freaked out and said she did not send any emails to me and that I had failed to a scam. I immediately called the bank EBay ### and the police to get help.Before I left for work on ### my boss asked me to meet with her the Financial Manager and another employee. My boss told me the money had to be repaid somehow so it was going to be my responsibility to pay back the $###000. $###. Being a victim of the fraud incident I was stressed from the day and the incident and agreed and signed a paper.On ### I told my boss I should not be held responsible for the repayment of the money and that I was not going to repay the money because I was a victim of the fraud incident. I also told her that I spoke with the Financial Manager or the organization before making the purchase. Neither I or the Financial Manager found suspicion in the email or the purchase request.On ### I was terminated. On ### I received my final paycheck. $###. Additionally I was paid about $###.Something seems fishy about the whole incident.Q1: Legally can this organization hold me responsible for the repayment of the money? I was a victim.Q###: Legally can this organization terminate me because of this incident? I was a victim.Q3: What next steps should I take?Q4: Who should I contact to take next steps?"43700.7784722222 You indicate that you were the victim of a fraud but then state that the organization wanted you to pay the money back which suggests that you paid for the cards with the organization's money.  Non-profits are held accountable for how they spend their money so this could seriously impact its operations beyond the amount at issue.  The employer is permitted to charge employees for expenses incurred as a result of the employee such as this.  The only restriction is that your effective pay rate not drop below the minimum wage as a result of the organization making deductions from your paycheck.As for your termination, you are an at will employee and as such can be discharged at any time and for any reason or even no reason at all.  Accordingly, you can certainly be discharged for this reason.  The only thing that an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon you being a member of a protected class.  The protected classes are based upon: race, sex, age, religion, national origin and disability.  People that fall for scams is not a protected class.Sorry but I do not see anything further that you can do in this case as the employer was well within its rights.43700.7916666667 Hi,i was recently terminated from a position due to absences. However, I am diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and ### disorder. I sometimes miss work due to the overwhelming panic attacks I suffer. My absences were the direct result of my illnesses yet I was terminated siting those absences as the reasoning. I disclosed that I have a disability but am unsure how the ### Act works. If Iâ€™m having a panic attack and call out, my employee looks at me as if I canâ€™t perform the job. If I say Iâ€™m sick and call out then I look lazy. There is now winning scenario for me. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s  to do. I have reached out to their HR team and they informed me they will take it up with a supervisor yet I havenâ€™t heard anything. Whatâ€™s the point of having the Americans with Disabilities Act if you are just going to be terminated for your disability?43707.9451388889 Thank you for your response. I did not educate myself on FMLA procedures so that is my fault. I have never known if itâ€™s best to disclose or not. I appreciate you taking the time to answer this for me. 43708.6527777778 The ### provides protections for those that are able to meet the requirements of the job but need a reasonable accommodation in order to do so.  Normally the first step when having a medical condition that leads to you needing to be off work would be a FMLA issue rather than an ### issue. Where a person has a medical condition such as you describe you would need to seek ### FMLA.  The procedure would be to speak to your employer in advance to submit the required paperwork which has to be completed by your healthcare provider to justify you qualifying for ### FMLA and on what basis. So did you pursue FMLA? If you failed to seek the proper protections under the FMLA then I donâ€™t think you are likely to be able to successfully assert a claim. If you already pursued and obtained FMLA but have exhausted the maximum amount of FMLA then you may be able to pursue additional protected time off under the ###. Again that must be done in advance and approved by getting your healthcare provider to complete the necessary paperwork for a reasonable accommodation.If you failed to take these steps prior to being discharged for attendance then it is unlikely that you will be able to successfully pursue an ### claim. 43708.5916666667 You are welcome. Best of luck to you. 43709.0875 I need help with my appellants brief I don't know how to do it for unemployment third appeal southern district43717.7930555556 If you are at the point where you are in front of the Missouri Court of Appeals it is highly unlikely that you will be able to prevail.  The reason being that this is not just the court taking another look at things but rather looking to see if there was a legal error by the Labor & Industrial Relations Commission.  That is an exceedingly difficult burden to meet.  Additionally, unlike appeals before the Appeals Tribunal and the Commission which are very informal, you will be required to comply with all of the same briefing rules that attorneys must follow.  There is no way that I or any attorney can describe for you how to properly draft an appellate brief.  What I can do is refer you to the Appellate Rules on the court's website which can be found Rule ### -- Procedure in All Appellate Courts and the Southern District Court's Rules at Southern District Local Court Rules  There used to be a ### that the court put out called the ABCs of Appellate Practice (or something like that) which every newly licensed attorney considered the bible of appellate practice.  Unfortunately, I could not locate it on the court's website just now and I had heard before that the court had discontinued its publication.  The key is that you must follow every little thing in the rules, no matter how silly it may appear to you, or the court will consider your brief non-compliant.I have only seen one (###) claimant successfully submit an appellant brief to the court - all of the others were dismissed by the court for the claimant's failure to comply with the rules - only to have the court deny her any relief.  I am aware of a case in which the court appointed one of the top appellate attorneys in the state to represent a claimant (which is virtually unheard of) and that attorney was successful in getting the Missouri Supreme Court to change its interpretation of the law.  That particular case had some extremely sympathetic facts and dealt with an area of the law that was rather confusing so I suspect that had a lot to do with it.  I've never heard of the court appointing counsel for an unemployment case other than that one instance.While I don't mean to be discouraging, the simple reality is that it is extremely difficult for an experienced appellate attorney to do much for a client at this point in the process.Just in case the above links do not work correctly the following are the actual ### for the linked webpages abovehttps://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=993https://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=224Good luck."43717.8763888889 Mechanic's lien statutes are strictly construed so if you make any error the court will toss it out and you will have nothing.  Additionally, since you are actually putting an encumbrance on real estate if it is not proper the property owner can sue your company for slander of title.

Alternatively, ### ### in ### is fairly well known and may be able to direct you to someone that can assist you.

Currently having it taken in for repairs, but am worried engine is completely destroyed.Is my employer responsibility for any of the tow ###? What will I need to do if they try to fight it?43737.7201388889 Update: the engine is completely shot and is needing to be replaced. I'm assuming this isn't something I'm going to be able to get the company to cover; even if I can show the engine was fine prior to this?43737.8527777778 I have been trying to get my unemployment every since ###rd and they seems to give me the run-around because they said I quit a job which I did do to the hours that they was giving me however they told me that they were going to give me more hours but I was napping seeing it there instead they were sending me home early and I just didn't like that all the time they was just sending me home and not other people and I feel like I was just getting treated differently ### the ones that have been there longer than I43748.5833333333 Hi ###:I am very sorry for your recent health issues and your job loss.  I hope you are doing better now.I cannot tell from your facts whether or not you have actually been terminated.  So, the first steps I suggest you take are ###) to find out if you still have a job and ###) to decide if you want to return to it.If you want to return to this job, you should inquire about FMLA leave.  As you may know, FMLA is a federal law that requires certain employers to provide up to ### (unpaid) and protect your job while you are out.  There are rules and you must also be a qualified employee.  Mostly, that means you must have worked there over a year as a full time employee and not have already used up your ###-year period.Also, your illness may provide you with some additional protections under the ### - Americans with Disabilities Act.  This Act says that your employer must not discriminate (which includes termination) against you because of your disability or what they regard" as a disability even if you do not actually have a mental health disability.  However for the ###'s protections to help you you must be able to perform the essential functions of your job.  This means if you (or your doctors) do not think you are ready or can/should return to the workload required your company would not have to hold a job for you.  In short you must be able to do your job with (or without) reasonable accommodations.  A reasonable accommodation can include a transfer to a less stressful job if such a thing exists at this workplace.Think about whether the above information applies to you.  If you think it does you should contact some Employment Law Attorneys in your area.  These types of attorneys usually provide free consultations.  Speak to one or two of these folks and see if they think you can bring a successful case for an FMLA or ### violation.I wish you the best in all your future endeavors."43770.6555555556 I am looking for legal resources and advice on whether my case is valid. Iâ€™ll attempt to keep it brief.I have been with said company ###. I had a lower salaried management position. About a month and a half ago I was informed my position was going away. On Monday ###-### ###20. Another person in the office who had the same job title was reduced and her responsibilities were split between me and another manager in st. ###. This feasibly doubled my work. Then the week of ###-### ###-###.Last weekend on ###-### ### I attempted suicide by overdose. I was unsuccessful and notified my father and girlfriend who came over to monitor my condition and mental health. I notified my area coordinator at work what had happened and informed him I would be unable to assist with the weekend event that was scheduled for that day. He ### me to seek help at a local hospital to which I did. I was checked out at ### hospital and released with a return to work for ###. I notified my HR manager via text who had already been brought up to speed about my condition by the area coordinator with my permission. Thursday ###-###. I started receiving work calls immediately which I had to refer to my boss. At approximately ### I was called by a ### ### from California who identified himself as a HR contractor working with my company. He stated my position was being reduced effective immediately and I was ### ###. I gave him my email which he sent the appropriate letters over. I have not signed the NDA or responded to the email at this time.After this call I called my area coordinator who stated this was not about the position going away and said my medical incident had been spread around the office. He stated by Tuesday 10-15-###. He stated he confronted HR who accused the area Vice President if releasing the info and entered his office closing the door. HR could be heard in the ### office stating â€œshe was not going down for thisâ€ and â€œwe could be sued for a million dollarsâ€. In subsequent calls with my area coordinator he stated the area VP called him and informed him due to my mental state I was a risk to the company and had to be let go. I have recorded some of these conversations with my area coordinator who wishes to stay anonymous but urged me to seek legal counsel.43759.6548611111 I recently applied for a lead installer position at Premier Surfaces and they gave my private information to ### and Home Depot without my permission or even telling me.  They shared my information for third party background checks because they do business with those ###.  I was not applying for a job at Home Depot or ### and never wanted them to have my information.  43762.0055555556 Yes.  When you applied, you likely agreed to terms such as background checks.  If ### and Home Depot is affiliated with that business, then that is apart of the background check.  If you wish to withdraw your application, you should let them know, otherwise you are subject to a background check.43791.7125 If an employee has received an overpayment of PTO, can an employer withhold the employees entire paycheck without notice until said overpayment is paid back? 43773.8333333333 If there was an overpayment the employer is certainly entitled to take deductions to get its money back.  That said, any such deductions may not reduce the individual's pay below the minimum hourly wage as that would be a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  To illustrate I will use $10/hour as your pay and $### as the minimum hourly wage.If you work ### $### $400.  If minimum hourly wage was $7.###, ### $###.  Based upon these numbers, your employer could deduct up to $###.  If the employer were to deduct more than $###.To find out the most that can be deducted from your paycheck you have to do the following calculation:Your hourly rate X hours worked during ### = Gross Pay Earned$### X hours worked during ### = Gross Pay at Minimum WageSubtract Gross Pay at Minimum Wage from Gross Pay EarnedNote that $### minimum wage is actually $###.  I cannot recall if the FLSA calculation must be based upon the federal minimum wage since it is a federal statute or if the statute applies the Missouri minimum wage rate.  If the Missouri rate is used then you need to replace the $7.### $8.###.If your employer is doing this and taking more than is permitted you should make them aware that they cannot do so legally as it is a violation of the FLSA which will cost them dearly.  Encourage them to speak with a local business attorney to ensure that they do this correctly.43773.9256944444 Hello, my husband worked at a trucking company call ### in ###, missouri. And they will not pay their employees correctly. They are ### them. My husband was suppose to get per diem.. and he hasn't seen it on his check. They keep coming up with excuses and my friend ### worked there as well and it's been over ###'t gotten her last check either. We just want our paychecks reasonable. 43775.61875 Also, I never filed for FMLA, I had only been with the company since ###, and I was under the impression you had to be there a year to get that.43780.7006944444 Good Morning ###,I am sorry to hear about your hospitalization and your employers response to your medical needs.In order to answer your question, I do need more information.  Can you please tell me what communication, if any, you had with your employer both before and during your hospitalization?  Also, had you ever notified your employer of your depression or the related symptoms.  Did you ever take FMLA or other leave because of your depression?Any other information you are able to provide will help me to better answer your question.Thank you,### 43780.69375 Hi ###, I notified my employer before I went into the hospital that my doctor was sending me into the hospital because of my depression and suicidal thoughts. They were aware of my depression before this happened. I was unable to contact them while I was in the hospital, but when I got out Friday I tried to contact them and all weekend. I intended to go to work on Monday today, but because of my illness I called to let them know I was still needing treatment and they suggested I resign. ###43780.7 How large (number of employees) is your employer and how long have you worked there?  Your ability to request medical leave is dictated by your length of time with the employer and the number of employees they have.###43780.7013888889 I missed a week of work while being hospitalized. I just want to know can they do that since it's a medical condition?43780.6729166667 Ok so there are at least ###'m guessing at least that or more in support staff. I've been there since ###rd of this year.43780.7055555556 Thank you43780.7277777778 You are correct with your understanding of your right to FMLA.  Because you have not worked there for a year, you have no right to medical leave under the FMLA.However, the Americans with Disabilities Act does provide all employees some coverage and the ability to ask for a reasonable accommodation.  Assuming you have not had any disciplinary issues leading up to your hospitalization and the fact that you had notified the employer of your depression both before the present incident and before you went into the hospital, you should be covered under the ###. Remember, I am working with limited information but my suggestion would be to ask your employer for a reasonable accommodation while you are working through your depression symptoms.  The courts have found time off from work to be a reasonable accommodation as long as you plan to return.  The sticking point with the ### is that you must be able to fulfill the essential functions of your job and it sounds like you were ready and willing to return to work today.If your employer merely asked you to resign, I would think an open dialog with them regarding your needs under the ### and your willingness to work should help them understand where you are coming from and hopefully they will be able to work with you.I hope this helps.  Good luck dealing with your employer and I hope you are able to start feeling better.###43780.7236111111 From your post it appears likely that you are going to run into the statute of frauds, which requires certain types of agreements or contracts to be in writing, or they are not enforceable.  See:  https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=###&bid=24148&hl= ###.  Statute of frauds â€” contracts to be in writing. â€” No action shall be brought to charge any executor or administrator, upon any special promise to answer for any debt or damages out of his own estate, or to charge any person upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another person, or to charge any person upon any agreement made in consideration of marriage, or upon any contract made for the sale of lands, tenements, ###, or an interest in or concerning them, or any lease thereof, for a longer time than one year, or upon any agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof, unless the agreement upon which the action shall be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person by him thereto lawfully authorized, and no contract for the sale of lands made by an agent shall be binding upon the principal, unless such agent is authorized in writing to make said contract.It is possible that something in writing short of a formal contract can avoid the statute of frauds.  You should check to see if you have any correspondence which would serve to evidence the terms of your agreement.  This might (possibly) even include e-mail or texts, although I don't know ### if there have been any Missouri appellate cases ruling that electronic communications constitute a writing" or not.As to the liens you mention you have filed you did not indicate exactly what type of liens your filed or when you did this.  If you properly and timely  filed mechanic's liens prior to the sale you might have a basis to enforce your liens against the property.  If you filed the liens after the sale you may have given the new owner the right to sue you.  You absolutely should have a conference with an attorney promptly to review in detail what you have done and what you should do now concerning the liens.  The attorney can also review the factual and legal history any documents of any kind you may have to give you an opinion as to the possibility of filing suit against against your former employer.The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function which may be useful in finding an appropriate local attorney:  ###Best wishes."43781.6888888889 I filed a Mechanics Lien against ###.  ### ### and two others that are still for sale.  Can I rescind a Lien once it is filed as that property has sold? 43781.8034722222 While living with as a partner and working for this person as an employee from ### 2015, I was promised the sum of $10,###.  That property ### on ###.  This person made no effort to contact me and has not responded to any of my communication attempts.  I've filed ### on the properties but fear this may have been a mistake.  There was no written proof on my end only his assurance that this compensation plan was noted in the company minutes. Do I have any rights in this situation at all?43780.9208333333 You really need to see an attorney to review what you have done and determine what should be done now.  It isn't clear that you had any right to file a mechanic's lien if (###) you were an employee, and (###) if the work was done several years ago.  You probably will need to file releases of all the liens, but should at least have a consultation with an attorney.  It is not possible to give a definitive opinion based on limited information on this forum.  If your liens were not proper and you failed to follow the mechanic's lien law, it is important you undo your actions quickly and properly.  An attorney's assistance is needed.The Missouri statute concerning mechanic's lien is Chapter ### -- https://revisor.mo.gov/main/ViewChapter.aspx?chapter=4###943781.8326388889 Aren't evaluations done on the employers dime? And they didn't ask for an evaluation when I started working. I've already been working for over a month. They weren't concerned" about my injury until they found out I have ###. When I read the ### it said after employment is already started they can't REQUIRE medical examinations just voluntary and they are refusing to let me work after I've already been working. Effectively firing me after I got better from an injury if I can't shell out hundreds to see a doctor. Can they really REQUIRE me to spend my own money to get confirmation from a doctor that I can do my job after I've already been doing it? "43782.7652777778 I strained muscles doing normal activities, was given ###, got better. My job won't let me work until I take a job description to a doctor, no insurance, to get approved on my own dollar. They found out I have ###, already been working for ###. The director said he was unaware but he clearly was because he was on the phone with the person I told. The director said its to protect their insurers. Asked for reasonable accommodation and they refused. Is this legal? I am at will employee for government funded non-profit. 43782.7333333333 The employer is merely trying to obtain confirmation that you are physically able to return to work without risk of reinjuring or worsening your existing injury. The employer is perfectly entitled to ensure that you are able to perform the work safely. You also say you asked for a reasonable accommodation which suggests an ### disability. If that is the case then the employer is just following the law in asking you to obtain an evaluation from your healthcare provider regarding any such accommodation. Bottom line, the employer is not only within its rights but is actually doing what it is required to do under the circumstances. 43782.7472222222 You represented to the employer that you were injured and couldn't work.  The moment you did that you could be required to provide proof that you are now able to return to work without restrictions.  This is not only permissible, it is standard practice among employers.  Since the injury at issue occurred off the job it is not the employer's dime to confirm that you are fit for duty.   As for having to pay hundreds of dollars to get confirmation that you are fit to work, there are almost certainly free clinics in the ### area affiliated with the local hospitals.  They may charge you $###'t be the hundreds that you are assuming it to be.Good luck.43782.7993055556 ###,Thanks for posting you question.  I'm glad to try to point you in the right direction.  If the employee said something about you that was untrue and it cause you damage (loss of a job or damage to your reputation), you can sue that person for Slander.  This is a complicated lawsuit, and is something that I'd strongly recommend you get an attorney to handle for you.  The question you have to always ask is even if you win the case and get a judgment against him, does that person have the money to pay you?  Otherwise it might not be worthwhile pursuing.If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reply to this message.  Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck with this matter.###43795.7993055556 Also the employee was trying to take photos of me and he's been accused of harrassment by other employees 43788.6416666667 I was suspended from my job (with pay) because an employee told them I assaulted him. And because of this I may not get a full time position i was seeking. My question is, is there anything I could do about this legally to be compensated for being accused and basically defamation of character, etc43788.6402777778 If you quit you will not be entitled to unemployment as you will have voluntarily quit without good cause attributable to work or employer.  Only if you wait for the employer to discharge you will you be eligible for unemployment benefits.  That is true even if you are certain that the employer is about to discharge you but hasn't done so yet.  Note, if the employer sits you down and tells you that it is discharging you but it will allow you to ### a resignation instead that is called a quit in lieu of discharge" and is treated as a discharge for unemployment benefits purposes.  The key difference between a quit in lieu of discharge and you quitting just before they are going to discharge you is which of you is making the decision to sever the employment relationship.  In a quit in lieu of discharge the employer has already decided that you will no longer work for the employer and it is merely giving you the choice of having it characterized as a quit for when you apply for other jobs.  If you quit on your own immediately before being discharged then it is you that has made the decision to sever the employment relationship - not the employer.  The reason is that there is no way that you can truly "know" that you are about to be discharged so you are the one making the decision to sever the relationship.As for the employer's so-called "contract" requiring you to remain there for another year I doubt it would be enforceable.  For a contract to be an enforceable each side must give something of value.  We call that consideration and it is a necessary element for a contract to be enforceable.  Clearly your agreement to remain for another year would be consideration on your part but what was the employer offering to give you to ### the pot from what you were already getting?"43789.8854166667 My coworker told that I had an interview. My job tired a contract saying I will not look for a job for at least another year. If I declined they don't know if they will keep me. I declined cause I need more pay and better opportunity. If I put my ###. Can I still get unemployment43789.6916666667 A couple more ### also originally contacted me on ###. i have my full work resume and ### resume in there and i was not on indeed to do any volunteer work and that is a site for jobs. Also my name is listed on the ### website as an assistant coach. All the other coaches that were listed on there were paid coaches. There was another coach on the staff that wasa volunteer and his name wasnt on there. Im the only coach that wasnt paid on that site. I been talking to HR also and the lady i talked too said that they didnt have any of my information on file but my name is on the site. My issue is if he clearly communicated to me that i was supposed to be a volunteer then when i was asking about being paid multiple times through text and in person that was never said. He never said anything about being a volunteer until those final ### after the season was over. If i wanted to volunteer i couldve stayed closer to home and wouldnt have to work ###. I wouldnt volunteer for that. Do you think i may have some kind of shot to win a case against them43791.5652777778 Also i have the ad that was on indeed that says it was a paid ### position. Nothing on this ad says anything about instructional assistant or it being a volunteer position 43791.625 Based upon the text messages you provided I don't see that you have any evidence that you were to be paid.  The initial texts appear to say that for you to be paid it had to be approved by the AD.  Those texts also contain a statement by the coach that you shouldn't show up for practices until you get confirmation that you are going to get paid.  As I read all of the texts it appears that you ended up showing up for practices anyway and are now surprised that you aren't going to be paid.  You did not provide a single text that shows the coach agreed to pay you for your services.  You reference having completed tax forms and everything" but the only thing mentioned in those text messages is getting fingerprinted which has nothing to do with getting paid.  Since you are going to be working with minors you are required to undergo a background check including being fingerprinted but that is required of virtually coaches even for little league if they attempt to participate in national ###.  Certainly not related to getting paid.Employment agreements must be in writing to be enforceable under the statute of frauds.  The courts won't enforce an oral agreement based upon the evidence that I saw in those texts.  Perhaps you have something more meaningful that you simply didn't include but those texts don't get you there."43790.9263888889 Evidently you simply want me to tell you that you have a great case but I cannot do that. I have outlined multiple times that you have what I consider to be a fairly weak case. I understand that you see it differently but that is to be expected as it is difficult for you to look at the case with an unbiased view. You said that you were on Indeed and that is for employment not volunteering. While that is largely true, what you forget is that the position you were offered was an instructional assistant and that it wasnâ€™t a paid position since you lacked the necessary degree requirements. You then rejected the job offer so the fact that you first connected on Indeed really has little relevance. Your name listed on the website may have some value but it by no means is strong evidence that you and the school district agreed to pay you. One serious problem that you will have difficulty getting around is why you continued showing up and ### when you werenâ€™t getting a paycheck. Until you can explain that you canâ€™t begin to convince a judge or jury to rule in your favor. What you donâ€™t seem to be understanding is that this isnâ€™t about you presenting evidence that you wanted to be paid or even that it may have been reasonable for you to think that you would be paid. To win you must convince a judge or jury that the school district agreed to pay you. Without that there is no â€œmeeting of the mindsâ€ as is required to prove your case. 43791.6013888889 I returned to practice after i filled out the tax paperwork and i thought the situation was handled. I do have more texts of us discussing me being paid and him telling me what i need to do to get paid. Would these be enough because here he is telling me that other coaches that quit needed to be dropped for me to be paid43790.9402777778 I was hired to coach a high school football team. I was supposed to work for the district as an instructional assistant but i didnt take the position. Since i dont have a degree i wouldnt have been paid as a coach but i didnt accept the position and discussed this with the coach and we ### about me being paid for ###. When it came time to get paid he told me it was a volunteer position and it was clearly communicated to me. I filled out tax forms and everything to be paid. Do i have a case to sue to be paid?43790.8847222222 It proves that it was discussed. It doesnâ€™t prove that it was agreed to by the school. The texts that you have provided merely shows that you wanted to get paid but the coach expressly told you that you werenâ€™t getting paid and couldnâ€™t get paid at least until ### left and the AD authorized hiring you. Iâ€™m not saying that you canâ€™t win that case but it will be an issue of your word against the schoolâ€™s with those texts generally helping the school more than helping you. 43791.2048611111 Iâ€™m glad to see that you have a good explanation for your continuing to work while not receiving a paycheck. That will alleviate what I saw as an insurmountable problem. It still comes down to what was agreed to between you and the coach. As such I think it is a long shot and isnâ€™t a case I would be willing to take as an attorney. It is up to you whether or not you wish to commit the time and effort to pursue. Good luck.  43791.6347222222 The lady in HR told me i would be getting paid and i went in to fill out tax paperwork the next day. I ### out the paperwork and gave them my direct deposit info for pay and everything. Is that still not enough? And he asked me about my college credits also when i asked him ### getting paid. Thats should prove that there was a discussion between us about me being ### it43790.9979166667 The position i was contacted about on indeed was for football. At the interview is when the instructional assistant was discussed and that was a position working for the ### from football. The requirements to be a paid coach are ###....which i paid for both of ### review was supposed to be free but he asked me if i completed it as we were leaving ### first game and it was due the next day.  I actually missed some days of practice due to this and then went back after i filled out the tax paperwork. Thats what i was told by the lady in HR that i needed to do to be paid. This isnt a weekly pr bi weekly ### was paid a stipend at the end of the season. I understand i may have a weak case because i dont have every thing needed but im trying to see if i have a legitimate shot at winning because i wouldnt have even coached over there for volunteer ### was supposed to be my first time being paid after volunteering coach at the youth level for ###43791.6152777778 Those additional texts just say what is required regarding the fingerprinting which would be required regardless of you being paid.  The only comment about being paid was that ### had to quit.  The other texts make it clear that for you to be paid the AD had to authorize you getting paid and before that could happen that other coach needed to quit.  Just because that coach ended up quitting would not automatically result in you getting paid.  You would have to be hired in that capacity after the AD authorized hiring a replacement for that other coach.  You need something far more clear than what I have seen so far.You say that you returned to practice after you thought that the situation was handled.  So what exactly occurred that made you think that the situation was handled?  It seems like you simply assumed that you would get paid once ### quit and left but that isn't a reasonable assessment of the text messages that you have sent thus far.43790.9791666667 I was working for a Graphic Company and me and one of the press ladies had gotten into an argument because she was very rude and hateful and we got in an argument on Friday before Thanksgiving and then the winds there right before Thanksgiving I got pulled off the floor and got told I was being laid off because they were running out of work but they also told me that they were going to have one of the hand printers do my job and my guess my problem is is that I have three other people that were hired after me but none of them were laid off it was just me I guess I'm just wanting to know is there anything I can do to try to fight it and it just it don't make no sense to me none of it does if you can get ahold of me I'd really appreciate it thank you. I I forgot to mention that they never even came and talked to me about the situation between me and the lady that got into it43803.8965277778 What you need to understand is that you are an at will employee and as such you can be discharged at anytime and for any reason or even no reason at all. Accordingly, the employer doesnâ€™t have to justify getting rid of you by lay off or discharge. The employer is free to lay off whomever it chooses and there is no requirement that it lay-off folks with less seniority than you. If the employer is really letting you go because of the incident with the co-worker it could just as easily have fired you regardless of whose fault it was and then protested your claim for unemployment benefits. By telling you that you are being laid-off it cannot contest those benefits and you will be able to tell prospective employers that you were let go due to business downturn rather than having to say you were fired. While I recognize that you would rather still have a job, this is the next best thing that the employer could do for you. 43804.2493055556 I was recently let go for sexual harassment never got told what I said or did that was harrassment I think it was retaliation for me saying something to the manager about his assistant manager telling me I need to fuck another employee to get rid of the tension and the only thing that happened to her was she was told not to say it again she still has a job and I get fired shortly after for sexual harassment. I have messages from the Manager saying I told him about it happening.43808.6333333333 Hello,I am sorry this policy has changed! I hope I can provide some helpful information which can help you when you meet with your management about this issue.Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, tipped employees must retain all tips or be a participant in a tip pooling arrangement where employees who customarily and regularly receive tips (for example, servers).  It sounds like perhaps you participate in tip pooling.  Under this arrangement, the employer must notify tipped employees of any required tip pool contribution amount, may only take a tip credit (i.e. where the employer takes a tip credit towards its minimum wage obligation equal to the difference between there required cash wage and the federal minimum wage) for the amount of tips each tipped employee ultimately receives, and may not retain any of the employees' tips for any other purpose. I have attached a Department of Labor Fact Sheet which you could print out and bring with you when you meet with your manager. This Fact Sheet walks through the scenarios I detailed above and can help provide you some leverage when asking for disclosure of tip amounts. Here is also a website which might be helpful as you put together your talking points on this: ###. It looks like you should be notified, at the very least, your tip amounts as those belong to you and not to the employer - even in a tip pooling arrangement. I cannot see any legal argument as to why they are able to keep those amounts secret. Best of luck!43819.6916666667 I'm a waitress at a chain restaurant. I only work events where the money is split between servers (sometimes bartenders and ###). The ### has now stated that we aren't allowed to know how much the party tipped us. I use that information to check my check every ###. Is this legal?

I worked for a general contractor earlier this year, and quit since he would never pay me on time. He never provided year to date earnings and deductions on my pay stubs.

Thank you. 43831.9701388889 Iâ€™m sorry that you are in a miserable work situation.  Hopefully you can avoid a better job.   Now for the bad news.   There are two ways that employment lawyers to cases.   Hourly.  You likely pay $200+ per hour and spend many thousands of dollars.  If you lose, you get nothing.  Contingency.  The attorney invests his or her time into the matter (likely thousands of dollars worth) and gets nothing unless you win or settle.  Based on the facts you described, I donâ€™t believe youâ€™ll find a taker.  Much of what you described is ### rather than unlawful discrimination.   I encourage you to focus on finding a better place of employment, where your skills and efforts are appreciated and rewarded. 43831.9798611111 Visit the EEOC website.  It describes the categories of actionable discrimination and the steps required before a lawsuit. What has been done to you?43831.9319444444 Can an employer pay a salaried employee hourly wages after they have been fired.43834.8340277778 Iâ€™m guessing that this question makes sense to you because you know all of the background but it isnâ€™t clear to me. My best guess is that you were discharged and your final paycheck includes a pro rated amount for your final day of work. I donâ€™t think that is improper since you didnâ€™t work the whole day and were discharged. As a salaried employee the employer canâ€™t reduce your pay for missing a portion of a shift generally but where you are being discharged I donâ€™t think that applies. Were you given your final paycheck at the time of discharge? Missouri law requires that you be paid your final paycheck at the time of discharge. If the employer fails to do so and doesnâ€™t pay you all amounts owed within ### (I think) ###. You could make a written demand for the amount that you feel you were shorted citing the statute and see what happens. 43834.8576388889 To be clear, I think that the employer CAN pay you a pro rata amount for the portion of the final day of work. Iâ€™m only suggesting that if you want to dispute it you can certainly try to do so using the Missouri statute. If you choose to go that route, you have to send a letter, not a text, and comply with everything in the statute. Which is ###. 43835.3798611111 Yes it was pro rated and i got fired at the end of the day and no i havent received my final check which i do believe i texted on the day i was fired ###  and again on ###43835.1506944444 Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re having to deal with this. No doubt it seems very unfair. Unfortunately, as an at will employee you can be discharged at anytime and for any reason or even no reason at all. So it doesnâ€™t matter if the reason is unfair or even if the employer is wrong. The only thing that an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon you being a member of a protected class (race, age, sex, religion, national origin or disability).43838.9097222222 The story itself is very complicated. However, the pertinent details I believe are these:I was terminated immediately and without time to full ### what I was being accused of at the moment. I signed what I considered to be a meaningless document on behalf of my provider, under the understanding he knew I and other members of his staff had reason to sign these documents that he had already signed electronic documentation addressing the situation in the patients chart. I was accused of falsifying his signature, even though I specifically turned down an offer to copy and paste his signature by one of his clinical staff for the exact document in question. I signed with my own generic signature. A letter addressing the exact situation written and electronically signed by the doctor himself was sent with the same form. This form is directly comparable to â€œformsâ€ I complete on his behalf by website, fax, and phone every day as a primary function of my job. I also sign electronic orders, encounters, and referrals in our system on my ###â€™s behalf based on their preferences. I have also been directed to falsify a Medical Assistant license exam by multiple members of both clinical staff and the administrative upper management in the past. I understood that I needed it for access to certain programs essential to my job. I would have gladly studied and taken the exam properly, but I was explicitly not given the opportunity. I feel as if I have been wrongfully terminated, and I feel like there is documentation both in the computer system we used primarily and in emails to show that everything I had been accused of was something I expressed concern about to management for related issues on multiple occasions. I need to know if there is anything I can do, as this has left me in an incredibly dangerous financial position as a single mother. I also planned on using this experience to apply to my future career path.43838.8576388889 My position at US Bank was Termed ### while I'm pursuing a Disability case with the Hartford Group (###) with ### ### ###-### and State(Appeal is active). My Manager was aware of my High Blood Pressure, ### and Acute Migraine but he failed to put me on light duty and the stress of the Senior Manager caused me to go to the Hospital several times with pressure ranging from ###. There was an internal investigation completed and shes no longer employed by US Bank for her ### toward me. I need help filing the correct case against US Bank, please advise.43840.8298611111 Before leaving for the Marine Corps in ### I worked for Walmart as an Auto Care Service Technician. I was never informed of my rights under ### by my employer. After being discharged in November I found out that Walmart had fired me for Job Abandonment". So I re-applied to the store I previously worked at and another store. The other store contacted me first for an interview so I went in and told them the reason I had left and that I was hoping to be hired for the position I had previously held with the company. I was told I was needed more in another position and that my pay would be reduced back to base level. I've read through what I found on ### on the Department of Justice's website and I believe this is a clear violation. I told my management team and then was told they were unaware of any such law. Am I correct in saying that it is a violation to put me in a completely different job?"43842.8680555556 I apologize but I cannot assist any further with the question.  I suggest that you post it again and I will not respond so that someone else can tackle this for you.  Good luck.43843.7444444444 I gave Wal-mart a verbal notice the day of my interview. And continual notices throughout my employment there. I wasn't fired until after I had already left for active duty.43843.3569444444 I was unable to provide them orders when I first left for recruit training. Because I was under orders to give my orders to no one and to not open the packet for any reason. I was told that giving a verbal notice was acceptable.As for when the notice was given it would have been during the initial hire prior to leaving.43843.6826388889 It doesnâ€™t appear to involve the ### as you were let go from Wal-mart for job abandonment rather than leaving for active duty. 43843.04375 Iâ€™m not following you. What do you mean by you gave verbal notice at your interview? Are you talking about the interview upon returning after active duty? What you did at that point has no bearing on the issue.The issue is that you seemingly failed to provide Wal-mart with your orders prior to leaving. You needed to do that to be covered under the statute rather than just stop showing up for work. 43843.6444444444 Good Evening,Can you please clarify the date you were terminated?  My understanding is that you were terminated on ###.  Is that accurate?Thank you,###43845.0402777778 I was terminated from my job due to attendance on ###,###&T from medical issues, I had done all the recquired paperwork but the 3rd party company that ### uses kept denying my paperwork even though ###'s did the paperwork and my primary even had the company on the phone to do the paperwork so the questions could be answered correctly so that the paperwork would go through, after multiple failed attempts, even with my primary on the phone with ###, it was still denied, my doctor then became frustrated with the whole ordeal and fired" me as a patient due to this then in turn since I couldn't get the paperwork done I was ultimately fired for Points. I had to have a ### and was out of work for ### and had ### which my orthopedic doctor said would be a side effect. This happened about a month and half after my surgery. I relied on the union to help me with this but after ### so in short my case was denied. I would like help in some form as to what I should do next. My union appeal has been denied twice. I feel that I am getting the short end of the deal I worked for ### for ### ###. I would still be there if it weren't for this."43843.6034722222 Unfortunately, there are statutes of limitation on both ### and FMLA claims.  What this means is that after a certain period of time, if a claim has not been brought, it cannot be brought.For an ### claim, you have ### ###.  The last potential violation by your employer is the date of termination which was ###.The FMLA operates differently than the ### as you can actually take an alleged violation straight to court without going through one of the Commissions.  That said, the typical statute of limitations for an FMLA violation is two (###) years.  There is a three (###) year statute of limitations if you can prove a willful violation of the FMLA.  Proving a willful violation of the statute is very difficult because the employer only needs to show he acted in a reasonable fashion when faced with the leave request.  From the information you have provided, it appears ### did not have the correct FMLA paperwork to provide you with the requested leave, which is likely sufficient for them to show they acted with a reasonable intent when they terminated you.Additionally, the FMLA only provides protected absence for twelve (1###) weeks in a year.  You stated that your ### had you out for three (###) months and then you needed additional leave for pneumonia/laryngitis.  Three (###) months roughly equates to thirteen (1###) weeks.  If ### terminated you after you returned from your ### and requested additional leave, they would not necessarily have violated the FMLA because you would have been outside of the twelve (1###) weeks of protected leave.I know this information is not necessarily helpful to your situation.  If you feel that ### did make a willful violation of the statute, you should locate an attorney in your area to see if he or she will bring the case for you.  It is important for you to act quickly because there are only six (6) months left for you to allege a willful violation of the FMLA.Please let me know if you have any questions about the information I have provided.Thank you,Jessica43846.6208333333 Yes my termination date was ### and for the past ### ###/###, and I believed the union was there to help me, I paid my dues and  I signed paperwork for them to get my medical records from the doctors, and I just found out after ###+ years that they didn't do it, I would check in every week or so to find out if the union needed anything from me, not once did they tell me they couldn't get my records, since the doctor had fired" me due to having to do the paperwork so many times (not to mention my doctor charged me $###/### paperwork) it has been extremely difficult for them to give me my medical records which I obtained some of them last month and did give to the union and since then I have been denied once again in a letter from around January of this year. The doctors office stated they didn't keep the facsimile papers showing how many times they had faxed the paperwork to ###. "43845.6347222222 I was supposed to start work Monday morning at 6:###-DOT drug test for a legal prescription for medical marijuana that I do not have to and not required to take during working hours only at night for my sleep insomnia. I told hr I would stop taking my medical prescription and give a clean iron sample and HR refused to give me the opportunity even tho I already had the job and was going to start work      I told HR in the beginning of my interview that I will not pass a drug test for my prescription and HR said it was ok as long as I had documentation to prove.  I refused to take a job opportunity with another company to pursue employment with bills electric Because they assured me that I had a job to start Monday morning 43844.8569444444 You seem to be presuming that because you have a medical marijuana prescription that you are not subject to an employer's drug testing policies.  Since medical marijuana legalization is very new in Missouri, I doubt there have been any appellate court opinions applicable to your situation.  But the general rule in other states has been that employers can choose not to hire a person based on marijuana use (legal or not).More than twenty states allow residents to use marijuana for medical purposes. These "medical marijuana" or "compassionate use" laws typically require the user to have a written doctor's authorization to use marijuana often for particular diseases or disabilities. If a patient meets the criteria he or she cannot be prosecuted under state law for crimes relating to the use possession or ### of a certain amount of marijuana. Federal drug laws still apply however.If you live in one of these states and have a valid prescription for marijuana you may be wondering whether an employer can refuse to hire you based on a positive drug test for this legally prescribed drug. So far in most states the answer seems to be yes. The California Supreme Court has ruled that the state's medical marijuana law applies only to criminal prosecution not to the workplace. Likewise the Colorado Supreme Court has held that an employer may fire an employee for off-duty use of medical marijuana even though the use was lawful under Colorado state law."   https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/drug-tests-job-applicants-if-33051.htmlI would suggest you confer with an attorney specializing in employment law if you wish to get a definitive review of your situation and your options (if any).  The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function here:  ###Best wishes."43845.21875 As an at will employee you can be discharged at anytime and for any reason or even no reason at all. So if the employer ultimately ### you for its belief that you are dealing drugs the employer is within its rights even if you werenâ€™t dealing drugs. The only thing an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon you being a member of a protected class (race, age, sex, religion, national origin or disability).As far as your assertion that the employer defamed or slandered you that is not correct. Defamation requires that the statement be published (made to a third party). All you have mentioned is that one of your bosses made a statement to you, not a third party. Additionally, to the extent that it is discussed amongst your bosses it isnâ€™t published as the employer is considered one party.I donâ€™t know why you havenâ€™t yet received your check since it seemingly should have arrived by now if promptly mailed. I suspect someone simply forgot to mail it and youâ€™ll get in the next day or two. If not that is a legitimate problem. 43845.1215277778 First off you ought to file for unemployment benefits as you don't get any benefits for the first week (waiting week).  The employer is required to give you your paycheck at the time you are discharged.  It is not clear from your post that you have been discharged.  It may be that the employer is trying to get your final paycheck together to give to you when it ### you.  On the other hand, it may just be that it is investigating the allegations and may conclude that there is nothing to the allegations.  There is a Missouri statute which I have copied and pasted below which addresses this situation.  Once you have been discharged if you still do not have your paycheck you will want to send a letter referencing this statute and demanding that you receive your full pay.  Pursuant to the statute, if you do not receive your full pay within seven (7) days of sending the letter you will be deemed to continue earning pay at the original rate for up to ###.###.  Payment due discharged employee â€” exceptions â€” penalty for delay. â€” Whenever any person, firm or corporation doing business in this state shall discharge, with or without cause, or refuse to further employ any servant or employee thereof, the unpaid wages of the servant or employee then earned at the contract rate, without abatement or deduction, shall be and become due and payable on the day of the discharge or refusal to longer employ and the servant or employee may request in writing of his foreman or the keeper of his time to have the money due him, or a valid check therefor, sent to any station or office where a regular agent is kept; and if the money or a valid check therefor, does not reach the station or office within seven days from the date it is so requested, then as a penalty for such nonpayment the wages of the servant or employee shall continue from the date of the discharge or refusal to further employ, at the same rate until paid; provided, such wages shall not continue more than sixty days.  This section shall not apply in the case of an employee whose ### for work is based primarily on commissions and whose duties include collection of accounts, care of a stock or merchandise and similar activities and where an audit is necessary or customary in order to determine the net amount due.The problem with the claim for defamation is that you must prove that you lost money as a result of the defamation.  No doubt you are familiar with the notion that statements which harm someone's reputation are compensable.  That was what was referred to as per se slander or libel and was the law for a long time.  Under per se ### damage to the reputation was presumed so there was no need to prove actual damages.  Unfortunately, the Missouri Supreme Court did away with per se ### close to ###.  The loss of your job (if it ends up occuring) would not qualify as the Employer is free to discharge you at any time and for any reason or even no reason at all.  Additionally, as I explained before, discussions between employer's employees are not considered to be third-parties so the loss of your job would not be a monetary loss for purposes of a slander claim.43846.7770833333 I have had several staff and residents at my place of employment message and come to me telling me of what has been said about me and the accusations against me. Several of my coworkers are relatives of personal friends of mine and my friends have come to me out of concern for what they've been told...

So bottom line, you cannot get help for this matter at this point.43853.7826388889 Dear Ms. Gargus,There is a great deal of detail in what you wrote and in the snippets of text attached.  This forum is for specific civil law questions.  Unfortunately it is not a way to obtain a comprehensive legal opinion about a particular personal legal situation.  It would not be appropriate for an attorney to give you specific guidance without reviewing and discussing all of the factual and legal history, documents, reports, full text history, company policy manual, etc.   Compare for example I separated from my wife in Illinois and moved to Missouri last year.  Can I file for divorce in Missouri?" with "Should I divorce my wife?"  The first is a specific civil law question the second asks for an opinion.From what you wrote in its most basic form the problem boils down to this:  you made a report to HR and are dissatisfied with the results.  In order to determine what actions if any are still possible - and equally importantly if you do have legal options whether or not it is in your best interests to pursue this further -- requires a thorough consultation with an employment attorney.  Only then can you get definitive legal advice and discuss your options.  I suggest you organize all of the related materials and schedule a consultation with a local attorney who handles employment issues.  Even if you determine not to pursue further action it would probably be worthwhile to have a full understanding of your options.  Best wishes.MISSOURI ATTORNEYSEARCH FUNCTION (MOBAR SITE):   ###"43859.9736111111 I am autistic. My employer and coworkers were notified upon the official diagnosis soon after I began working there. A married male superior also befriended me as soon as I started working there. He eventually revealed his interest to be sexual. I had already told him I was not okay with sexual relations with married men. He pursued anyway. Initially, I went along with it pretending to want sex with him, also. I was afraid for several reasons to report him. The night I finally told him I wouldn't sleep with him, he started a fight. Told me I didn't have the mental capacity" to do anything he does at work. I reported the incident to a manager and filed a complaint with HR. I was also asked to provide screenshots of the texted conversations. I was even told this man had been reprimanded before for sexual harassment before I ever worked there. After the internal investigation he was allowed to keep his job. Instead they wrote me up for harassment and bullying because in one text I told the man his bullying behavior is why people at work don't like him. They chose this punishment instead of the verbal unofficial warning which is the first step in the company's ###. They also said if I do anything like this again that instead of a second write up that I will be fired immediately. Nothing was done about the hate speech and disability discrimination. They just believed him that he never wanted or intended to do anything sexually even though he goes back and forth in his story. On top of that they determined that I am just as much to blame for befriending him and following his lead out of fear. This man is also personal friends with the HR representative at work. She claims that she is everyone's friend but this man is the only person at work known to sit in her car during smoke breaks. Am I blowing this out of proportion? Should I get over it and just not engage with people for fear of being manipulated? Or am I in the right to feel like I need to legally stand up for myself? I am very lost and confused here. I had a couple of audio recordings of my private meetings with management but was advised that it was illegal to obtain those so I threw out the flash drive."43859.7006944444 ###,Thanks for posting your question.

It is not for locating an attorney or an attorney reference service.The Missouri Bar does however have an attorney search function here:  ###That site may help you find an appropriate attorney to retain for advice and representation.Best wishes.43865.6291666667 I recently was fired from my place of employment on Monday, ### after creating an Etsy shop called the Birthworker Supply Co last week. This Etsy shop was meant to be a one-stop shop for birthworkers (doulas, midwives, lactation consultants, etc) to buy supplies related to their practice and clients. I had created an supply list via Excel sheet and the supplies include: bulb syringes, placenta models, infographics on birthing positions, ### ###, pill capsules and other items. I also planned to sell body care through the Etsy as I've enjoyed creating lotions and ###s since childhood. The body care was to be limited to: Hand salve, lip ###, Rosewater, and ### ### for chest feeding folks. Currently, I was selling a Hand ### and Lip ### on the Etsy shop. I marketed it through my personal social media (which is not affiliated with my place of employment) and received orders from people unaffiliated with my place of employment. My employer found this to be a violation of my non-compete contract which I signed at the beginning of my part-time employment. However, the packaging of the product was different, the products (hand ### and lip ###) are not sold in the store either. The store sells: loose leaf ###, tea ###, ### ###, and ### butter. None of which I had any plans to sell. My boss pulled me into this meeting and fired me without warning. A board member happened to be in the office, and I requested that she be included in the meeting. She agreed that I should be terminated, however, they have not taken this situation to the rest of the Board. Additionally, I was informed that I needed to delete the Etsy shop, Instagram, and Facebook page. I was also informed that I would be unable to work as a doula as I was certified through this employer's doula certification pre-employment. Additionally, three weeks ago, she overpaid me around $500. She called me requesting that some money be taken out of my paycheck each pay period until the $###. The organization is also a 501(c)###-profit. I have also requested copies of my employee contract and also my employee evaluation from the organization. I am wondering if I have any grounds for recourse?43865.6701388889 Let me begin by saying Iâ€™m sorry to hear that you are having to go through this. I know that economic uncertainty is very stressful. To begin with, you need to understand that you are an at will employee unless you had a written employment contract providing employment for a specified period of time. Accordingly, you can be discharged at anytime and for any reason or even no reason at all. The only thing an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon you being a member of a protected class. The protected classes are race, age, sex, religion, national origin and disability. So unless you can prove that you were discharged for being a member of one of those protected classes your discharge was perfectly legal. Although the employer is likely well within its rights to discharge you, it seems questionable whether it can establish that you were discharged for misconduct" sufficient to deny you unemployment benefits.  Accordingly I would be sure to file for benefits as soon as possible.Additionally there are some issues with the employerâ€™s actions regarding the non-compete agreement. Let me begin by noting that without reading the non-compete agreement in its entirety I cannot evaluate its terms or its enforceability.  All I can do is provide general informaiton about the enforceability of these agreements generally.  Non-competes are really agreements prohibiting unfair competition rather than all competition. Many businesses have employees sign non-competes thinking that they will protect themselves from competition but that is not the correct use of such an agreement. In order for a non-compete to be enforceable it must involve the protection of a protectable property right.  For example if you worked somewhere that had specialized techniques for making something that was not known to others the company would have a legitimate property interest in prohibiting you from being able to leave and take that same knowledge to compete against the company.What this company seemingly is alleging is that you had access to its confidential customer list which can be a property interest sufficient to warrant protection from competition using the customer list.  The problem is that while the customer list may be a sufficient basis to warrant protection in such a case it should be limited to competition pursuing those actual clients.  Additionally Missouri courts are reluctant to grant an injunction in cases where the defendant has been discharged without cause.  That doesn't keep the business from pursuing damages against you but typically the only thing that the employer really wants is the injunction.  Once it learns that it won't get an injunction it normally isn't worth pursuing.  Note a Missouri court will have little ### granting an injunction where the discharge was for good cause.Bottom line if you are only interested in suit for the discharge I see very little chance of prevailing but you can (and should) contact a local business lawyer experienced with non-compete litigation to discuss protecting your internet businesses."43865.8652777778 Dear Mr. ###,I believe you may be confusing different legal issues.  There are state and federal limitations on wage garnishments.  However you have an agreement with your employer by which you have apparently authorized deduction of your rent charges from your paychecks.  This sounds like a contract dispute and not a wage deduction dispute.  Garnishment limitations are not applicable to employment agreements which includes (in effect) voluntary income rent deductions.  You did not mention if the employment/rental agreement is in writing, so I am assuming it is a verbal contract.  If you are referring to federal law which limits certain withholding so that the employee must receive minimum age, there are exceptions to this -- in particular for lodging.Under federal law, thereâ€™s an exception to the general rule that paycheck deductions cannot bring an employeeâ€™s pay below the minimum wage. Employers may deduct the cost of providing lodging and meals to employees, even if that causes the employee to take home less than the minimum wage. In fast food restaurants, for example, many employees work minimum wage jobsâ€”and employers often charge employees the cost of one meal per shift.  https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-can-you-deduct-from-employees-paycheck.htmlIf your rent is equal to ###% of your pay, it may be time for you and your girlfriend to seek other employment and move on.  You could contact a local attorney to review your employment contract.  You could also try to resolve this with your employer/landlord by reducing your agreement to a written document, if there is none.  An attorney on this site cannot offer an opinion as to what you should do.  However you decide to proceed can impact both your employment and housing, and there are obvious considerations regarding the future relationship between you and your landlord/employer.  It seems there are three main choices -- work this out with your landlord/employer, hire an attorney for advice and representation, or move on to other employment and living arrangements.Best wishes.43896.9708333333 My girlfriend and I work for a hotel. We live and work at the location so we pay rent as well. We had an arrangement with the owner that we'd receive our paychecks then proceed to remove what we needed to in order to survive off of and then pay the remainder to the rent. The owners have now decided to deduct about ###% of our checks each towards rent WITHOUT our consent. I looked into the wage laws of Missouri and I read that they are allowed to deduct whatever they so please as long as they don't deduct past the point of where we worked minimum wage for the hours we worked. I'm confused on who to contact or what to do about the situation. 43878.9493055556 My husband and I would like to apply for a small business gov't grant, and don't know how to do it. We have no idea what the requirements are, or what we need to provide to apply for grant money. That's why we need some legal advice, but have no money to pay for the service.Thank you,Melba and ### ###43880.1166666667 Dear Mr. ###,It isn't really possible for an attorney on this site to evaluate what sort of claim you have, if any, under the circumstances.  You will need to schedule a consultation with an attorney who handles Labor/Employment Law for Employees.  The Missouri Bar has an attorney search function which you may use to help find an appropriate local attorney.

You donâ€™t appear to be a member of a protected class (race, age 40+, sex, religion, national origin or disability).43888.0215277778 I quit my job I absolutely loved due to a childish coworker making me miserable everyday, harassing me, she has made other people quit & I feel discriminated because I am young and was only there for ###â€™t want to fire her because she â€œ### the black cardâ€ and sheâ€™s been there so long! On a DAILY she messed with me and another coworker. 43888.0055555556 I was terminated on ### from Freeman Health System. I had worked in the Human Resource Office since ###.  My attendance record was nearly perfect with the exception of the occasional tardy or missed clock in occurrences.  I had received a raise in ###.  Their discharge reason was falsification of ### Kronos. Two circumstances were questioned.On ###, I had gone to the pharmacy at my workplace to pick up a pain med prescription because I was in a lot of pain. The details of what I did are included in the attached letter.  My normal clock in time was 8:###. As I was parking on the street, I saw my boss driving in her car and she waved at me. As the letter states, I was at my work area at 8:10, well within the break time allowed in their attendance policy. I submitted a fair treatment appeal and they responded they felt the action of discharge was appropriate.On ###,  I clocked in at my normal site and drove to the Business Center to pick up checks at the Accounting office several blocks away. Freeman thought that I should have driven to the Business Center and clocked in there.  After picking up the checks, I returned to my work area. They agreed I was in my work area at 8:###. My unemployment has been denied.  I have appealed their decision and have a 2nd phone appeal interview ###/### 12:###0.An agent of the federal department of labor agreed that I should have been on the clock while driving from site to site to pick up checks.   I have sound reasons backed by fair labor standards for the break and for driving on the clock from site to site for work duties.  My colleagues would clock in for the morning and go straight to get breakfast or coffee in the morning nearly daily in the same location I was in when I picked up my prescription.  The coffee shop is next to the pharmacy.  I do not see a difference (other than the fact that I drove). I believe driving actually saved me time of having to walk over to the hospital and walk back. My question is: what are my options and how should I proceed at the appeal hearing? I contacted two local attorneys and one said it would be cost prohibitive for getting attorney representation to attend an unemployment hearing.  I have read about other possible arguments like wrongful termination, discrimination, etc, but I do not know if my circumstance would meet any of those reasons to pursue anything beyond trying to appeal for unemployment. I know Missouri is an at will state so even without the reasons they gave they could still discharge me for no reason, but I feel there may have been other reasons for the discharge that weren't disclosed.  I think I should be allowed to receive unemployment to help keep me afloat financially while I find a new job. 43892.2916666667 I worry that you have not received any response.   I myself have no knowledge abbut such hearings.   I do see that the lawyer at these website does such things:http://www.kcarplaw.com/preparing-unemployment-hearing-missouri/http://www.timslaw.com/missouri-unemployment-claim-appeal-process.htmHere is some information, but it is from out of state:   https://www.palawhelp.org/resource/what-you-should-know-about-the-unemployment-aI wish you the best.    ### ###43895.6493055556 I worry that you have not received any response.

Those are the special classes that are provided special protections. Otherwise as an at will employee you can be discharged at anytime and for any reason or even no reason at all. If you feel that you can prove that you were discharged for being a member of one of those protected classes you should arrange to speak with a local employment attorney to discuss your case.  If you are just thinking that the discharge was â€œunfairâ€ you need to understand that fairness is not and never has been part of employment law.As for your unemployment claim, both sides must submit any documents that they intend to introduce at the hearing to the appeals referee AND to the other side by the time of the hearing. So you should receive a copy of any documents the employer intends to use. Likewise any documents you want to introduce must be sent to the employer even though the employer already has them   Otherwise you wonâ€™t be able to introduce them. To be clear, there is no requirement that the documents be submitted sufficiently in advance that the receiving party have time to review them - just that they arrive no later than the time of the hearing.  If an in-person hearing the documents are typically presented at the time they are being introduced as evidence.You can try to subpoena documents but you will have to identify specific documents - not just all hard copy and digital documents - and establish that the documents are required and relevant. Appeals Referees are typically not very receptive to such requests but in the right case they will issue a subpoena. You cannot take depositions as the statutory framework doesnâ€™t provide for any discovery aside from the possible subpoena of documents. While you are certainly able to object to any evidence at the hearing, your objections are limited to â€œlegalâ€ objections such as relevance, hearsay and lack of an evidentiary foundation. Objecting to testimony which you disagree with is both improper and likely to get a reprimand from the Referee. 43894.7979166667 Possible unlawful termination and denial of unemployment compensation has occurred and appeal has been filed(Missouri UI). Do I have the right to acquire all hardcopy and digital evidence from the employer?  Can I depose the employer's witnesses?  Can the employer present evidence at the hearing that I have not been provided, pre-hearing? Can I 'object' during the hearing to contest an employers statement?43894.7618055556 Hi ###:I am sorry that you have been ill and that you are requiring a surgery.Whether or not your insurance will cover a future surgery has nothing to do with when you put in your notice to leave your job.  These are two separate issues.You can quit your job anytime you want - the law does not require any advance notice so unless you and your employer have agreed to something else by a contract, you can leave whenever you choose.  However, be aware that your health insurance coverage may end with your job.If your current health insurance is through a large employer, you should ask your HR officer about COBRA.  COBRA allows you to continue your health insurance coverage even after you leave your job.  However, your health insurance premiums will be very expensive on COBRA.  This is because your employer is likely paying a significant portion of the cost of your current premiums and they will not be paying that portion when you leave your job.  This means that if you need your current health insurance to cover a future surgery and you will not be able to afford the COBRA premiums, you should not quit your job until after your future surgery.If you choose to quit anyway and COBRA is available, make sure you get the paperwork filled out and returned to the proper place and the premiums paid on time so that you have coverage for your future surgery.Another option you might consider, is whether your new job will have health insurance coverage.  If it will, find out if there is a probation period or how soon that coverage could start.  If it starts right away, that new policy could cover your future surgery.  You will have to make sure that your current doctor and the hospital where the surgery is planned will accept your new health insurance.  Also, ask about what your deductible and co-insurance costs will be so that you know your out-of-pocket expenses in advance.There is one other concern about switching to a new job when you know you have a surgery coming up.  You will not have FMLA coverage on your new job until you have been there for ###.  This means that there will be no federal law to force your new employer to hold your job for you when you are out after surgery.  Be sure to ask your new employer what their policy is on missing work after a surgery before you are eligible for FMLA protections which should pick up again after your 12-month anniversary.Surgery is expensive even with health insurance and planning for time off work is very difficult.  Please be sure to read this answer over carefully and think about your options before making any sudden moves.Best wishes in all your future endeavors.43899.8652777778 I'm on fmla and going back to work have been off for ###, fmla  While I was off they posted my position but never filled the position  I was upset and my doctor told me it would be in my best interest to find a better job anyway  I did find one.

It is not a site for learning how to represent yourself.  While you have the right to attempt to represent yourself, most people lack the knowledge and skill to successfully handle their own cases.  If you chose not to retain an attorney, you will need to familiarize yourself with the administrative procedures before the particular state agency.  As a pro se litigant, you need to be knowledgeable about the substantive law, discovery available and the rules of evidence.  The decisions about how to handle your case, witnesses to call, evidence to present, objections to evidence, etc. will all need to be made by you since you have chosen to act as your own attorney.You would be well-advised to retain competent legal counsel for advice and representation.  An attorney on this site cannot determine how you should handle your own case, nor would it be appropriate to speculate about this.  An attorney familiar with the applicable substantive law can determine the best way to proceed.

It has been a month now and they keep tellime that the title/deed is being processed. I called the title company twice and they are telling me nothing is being processed. There is a contract with the employer. I have fulfilled my part, they have not. They have stated that I will not get the property until the house I remodeled sells. That is not what we agreed on in the contract.43907.7451388889 I suggest that you at least have a consultation with an attorney to go over the contract, and make sure your position is legally sound.  If so, then your attorney can send a demand letter on your behalf to try to shake loose the money you are due.If that does not work, depending on the mount of money involved, you'll need to decide whether to file suit with an attorney or file representing yourself in a small claims case.  Most courts have online small claims pamphlets or brochures online.Best wishes.43908.74375 Who or what kind of lawyer do I need to talk to about hours cut, no brakes, lack of safety for my self as I am also pregnant.Had allergic reactions to a chemical working with Waffle House.### City Missouri43913.6534722222 You will need to speak with a local employment attorney that primarily represents employees instead of employers.  That said, you should know that contrary to the public's perception, there are no laws that require an employee to receive breaks during their shift.  Additionally, an employer is free to change the terms of employment at any time, including cutting hours, just as the employee is free to not accept those changes.  In terms of your concerns about a lack of safety due to your pregnancy, I'm not sure what you are referring to.  As to your allergic reaction, have they required that you continue working with that chemical?  If not, then that is hardly an issue.  If they have required that you continue using that chemical is it related to the current COVID-###?  In other words, is it something that is being used to ensure ### and protection from the spread of the virus?  If that is the case then I can certainly understand the employer's insistence that it still be used.As stated at the outset, if you are going to pursue this matter you should contact a local employment attorney that primarily represents employees instead of employers.  You should do so promptly as the passage of time can limit your rights and possibly preclude you from pursuing your concerns.Best of luck to you.43913.7041666667 I can appreciate your belief that your privacy had been intruded upon by the employer asking for confirmation of the negative test results.  However, from a practical standpoint, the employer is attempting to ensure that your mother does not spread a highly contagious disease that the government is taking extraordinary measures to contain.  From a legal standpoint, your mother is likely an at-will employee and as such can be discharged at any time and for any reason or even no reason at all.  Accordingly, the employer is well within its rights to not allow her to return to work for two weeks.  Under the circumstances, she would not be entitled to be paid for the time off work.43914.8861111111 I fell ill on Thursday, ###th and on Saturday, ###st, had to be tested for COVID-19.

I have a copy of my contract, a photo of his email if you need it.43915.9486111111 I can look at the contract for you if you attach it.  As for the unemployment benefits, that is correct as the legislation hasn't yet been passed by the US House of Representatives.  I specifically stated in my post that it was likely to get passed in the next day or two.  At present, it has been passed by the Senate but the House was hoping to get it passed today or tomorrow.  Once it is passed by both the House and the Senate and signed by the President then it will apply.  I would try to apply again next week and if you are told that there is no such coverage available then ask to speak with a supervisor as the person you are speaking with may not yet know of the changes.43917.7055555556 I typically charge $250 (which is my hourly rate) to review a standard contract. As this is part of the pro bono program I can cut it to $150. What you need to understand is that it is doubtful that you will be entitled to the full amount since you arenâ€™t working for the full period. Additionally, this business likely cut you lose because it couldnâ€™t afford to pay you with the business losses from COVID-19. Because of that I donâ€™t think it is wise to spend much time or money pursuing this. 43927.2708333333 Thank you.###43927.4791666667 Thank you.Would you be open to reading it?

Then they are passed off to me to set up in a room, take an xray and so on before the doctor comes in. The hygienist has been working on ### the office because she has no patients to aid in stopping the spread of covid 19. But no screening has been done on any patient that was brought in the office for me to see. Nether of my coworkers would answer me when I asked them if they would be comfortable seeing patients as I had been doing. No one there believed it was there responsibility to screen even though the doctor apologized because he should have been having them screen patients. Then today I'm being pushed around in text telling me what I'm saying isn't true and asking me to resign. 43923.9666666667 If you were laid off then you are eligible for unemployment benefits to begin with. However, if your employer extends a suitable offer of work and you refuse it that can disqualify you from benefits. The issue is whether or not you are available for work as required to be entitled to receive any benefits.  So unless the job being offered is very different from your normal job you can be denied benefits. If you normally perform work for the employer as a lawyer or accountant, the n offering you a maintenance position is hardly a â€œsuitableâ€ offer of work but if you normally do blue collar type work then this work offer could very well lead to you not receiving benefits. I canâ€™t assess it any more accurately without more specifics. 43926.1381944444 Work said I would lose my benefits if I did not return on this next Monday.

But, isnâ€™t that breach of contract?43927.4388888889 What you need to understand is that you are an at will employee and as such the employer can change the terms of employment at any time. Whether or not you accept those changes is up to you but you have no legal basis to force the employer to honor what you agreed to. 43927.2770833333 You can sue anyone for anything but that doesnâ€™t mean that youâ€™ll prevail. That document isnâ€™t considered an employment contract under Missouri law as it expressly states that it isnâ€™t a contract for any specific period of time. So you do not have a viable case for breach of contract.  43927.5263888889 I apologize my question is should I have checked the box yes or no when it asked if I receive pension?since Iâ€™m not receiving pension from my past employer Iâ€™m receiving QDRO.

Unemployment is asking for information about my pension from my employer and of course pension isnâ€™t coming from my past employer. I was laid off because of shut down due to ### Virus and need to claim unemployment 43931.6465277778 Thank You for your time. I appreciate it43931.78125 You have not actually asked a question. I assume you are wanting to know what you should do at this point. You simply need to convey your error to the Division Deputy assessing your eligibility. The reason for asking the question is that you are not eligible for benefits (or must include the amount of pension) to the extent that you are receiving a pension. I expect that the Deputy will be contacting you via phone to discuss the issue at which time you can clarify that the amounts received are not in place of wages. In the event that you are denied benefits, you should promptly appeal the Deputyâ€™s Determination. It will then be set for an Appeals Hearing where you can clarify the situation to an Appeals Referee. 43931.7236111111 You should have checked â€œNO.â€ 43931.7694444444 I have a question regarding a manager editing a time clock entry. For example, I would clock in at 6:### 7:###. Is this legal? is this within the power of the company/manager? I know this is vague but i didn't know where to find answers43931.7215277778 I suspect the employer just doesnâ€™t realize what it is doing is wrong and once it realizes that it will stop. The amount that it is saving canâ€™t be enough to justify the risk.The reality is that it is doubtful that it would be worth pursuing for your own benefit. So if it were me, I would simply mention to the employer that it probably shouldnâ€™t be doing that as it is a violation of the FLSA and if it is caught the employer will have to pay twice the amount that it should have paid to begin and possibly penalties on top of that. If you want to pursue it I would just  file a complaint with the US DOL wage and hour division. 43931.7680555556 Thank you for the quick reply. I work for sun belt rentals. I didn't know there was no need to worry about you telling my employer. The time clock was definitely edited and Iâ€™m not sure exactly what I need to do next as in do I need to document my time clock every day and gather evidence orâ€¦? I know this is a free consultation but Iâ€™m in between a rock and a hard place and I am seeking the advice of someone more wiser than myself as I was referred to this website from a lawyer friend of mine deal in labor laws. Thank you 43931.7479166667 You failed to list the name of the employer which is necessary for an attorney to be able to identify if he/she has ever represented that employer.  The reason that is necessary is that it is a conflict of interest for a lawyer to provide advice to someone if they are or have represented the opposing party.  If you are concerned that the attorney would inform your current employer of the inquiry, that is not permitted so donâ€™t worry about that. Iâ€™m willing to provide general legal principles in response to your question.Iâ€™m guessing that you were scheduled to begin work at ### and that is why the time was changed to be consistent with your scheduled start time. The problem is that you must be paid for all hours that you actually worked pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  So if you actually performed work between 6:45AM and ###, that work is not being included in your pay and is a FLSA violation. If you simply clocked in early but didnâ€™t actually start work until ### then technically the change was just correcting it to properly reflect what you worked. If that is the case, then it is risky as the US DOL is going to place the burden of proof on the employer to prove that.Generally, I strongly advise against changing folksâ€™ time entries and instead institute a strong policy against employees ### in early. Obviously, if the employer is just blatantly reducing your time worked to cut payroll expenses that is a violation of the FLSA and will result in serious consequences. 43931.7381944444 I worked for ### ### Fitness Center. It was closed due to covivid-19. My option was to go to the front lines and take peopleâ€™s temperatures or go home with no pay. I have an asthmatic son and lost a son years ago years ago to complications from flu. Yesterday was the anniversary and is a hard time of year. I chose to protect my family. Do I have a claim for unemployment because I turned down another position where Iâ€™m not trained or hired for?43935.1277777778 Sorry to hear about your situation. I think under the virus we are living with that you should apply for unemployment. I doubt it will be challenged, unless you have already applied and have been turned down. If that is the case, follow the rules and appeal.Good luck to you. Stay well.43935.8118055556 Hi Mr. Singer.  You are in a tough situation.  I do not think you qualify for unemployment until you use up your PTO.  Once you do, you will actually be a part-time worker and entitled to apply for unemployment - you will not get the full amount, but a portion of the usual unemployment.  You may also qualify for all or part of the federal COVID-###, along with the usual state unemployment.  Good luck and feel free to follow up with any additional question about this problem.43935.7548611111 I am  in apartment maintenance.  There are ###.

They are working one guy m w f and the other t th then we switch. ### it legal to force us to use our pto to fill gaps and can i claim unemployment since they cut my income in half?43935.7375 Generally speaking fear of contracting COVID-###. If the employer is engaging in unsafe practices that might be a basis provided that you have addressed the issue with upper management, given it time to address it and it isnâ€™t addressed. 43936.9798611111 So I've been planning to move to Long ### in New York for months with an intended move date of ###. However, due to the COVID-###, I am considering pushing that date back, especially with additional stimulus bills coming from ###, and the present difficulty in acquiring a decent job there within my wheelhouse. However, those reasons also make timing crucial in regards to my question, displayed in the subject line. In order to qualify for unemployment when quitting a job in Missouri, good cause must be demonstrated. I work as a behavioral support professional.Does the current pandemic qualify as good cause" for unemployment if I should quit by providing my ### notice particularly considering the lack of support demonstrated by my company via lack of ### provisions and insisting that should clients want to we should violate stay-at-home orders?"43936.8979166667 I am a seasonal employee with ### in Park City, UT. I work there from November to ### every year and in ### SC from May to October. The season ended early because of Covind19. I am receiving unemployment. I am moving to ###, SC in an attempt to begin the Summer season. I contacted my last employer there, Zero ###. The owner said that he might have a position for me in ###; but, has to get his full time people back to work first. I received a phone call from HR at ###. They informed me, and several other seasonal employees, that we would be hired back, at $###, for ###. I will be living in SC but am drawing Unemployment Insurance from UT. I would prefer to wait things out in SC and find employment there rather than go back to UT because it is high season in SC and low season in UT.  If I decline ###'s job offer will I become ineligible for unemployment insurance?43938.6784722222 Thank you.  I spoke to my employer in Utah and agreed to be hired back at $###, at ###, for ###, as long as I do not have to report to work.  This essentially allows me to have ###.  Thank you for your assistance. 43938.7923611111 Well, that worked out great for you.  Glad to hear it.  Good luck.43938.7951388889 You asked this question on the Missouri Free Legal Answers so naturally it is being posed to Missouri lawyers. The question you want answered is  going to be based upon ### unemployment benefits statutes so it would be best posed to an attorney licensed in Utah. What I can tell you is that under Missouri law the refusal of a suitable offer of work would be a basis for the employer to protest your unemployment benefits. I would assume that Utah has a similar provision but you need to ask a lawyer licensed in Utah to be sure. 43938.7569444444 ###, I can give you some advice over the phone about how to handle the hearing - that will be for free.

What was your job at the facility?  And are you working and living fairly close to ### City?43938.8486111111 I was terminated from my job on ###. Untill filing an appeal, I wasnt sur of the exact reason. They claim I falsified a contract. I did not. According to the documents I received due to the UI appeal, they verified the signature was not that if the person intended by showing her and asking her. But, I did not sign her name.They claim I signed as the facility representative but I dont know that it is my signature because I was never shown the document or asked. There were three other people getting contracts signed in that same time period. It is documented that my co worker was not in question on the date in question because she was not in the building. Not true. She was there and left early for a funeral.Even if the signature for the facility is mine, that does not mean I was present when the patient signed their portion. I told the hr department during the interview that I had left contracts with patients to review, and collected them at a later time.Also, several times, I had received contracts signed by patients but not a facility representative. In which case, I would sign them.I feel I was targeted and my employer was looking for reason to terminate me. On ###, I had a conversation via text with my Administrator in which I expressed concerns of a hostile work ### and the stress it was causing. Nothing was done. I was given a ### ###.

However, contrary to most people's impressions, employees don't have many rights as far as keeping their job. As I already explained, as an at-will employee, an employer can discharge you at any time and for any reason or even no reason at all.  The only thing that an employer may not do is make an employment decision based upon you being a member of a protected class.  The protected classes are race, sex, age (40+), religion, national origin, and disability. Since you were discharged for reasons unrelated to any of those categories there is nothing that you can do with regard to your employer's discharging you.That said if you are unable to obtain employment elsewhere because of what happened then someone is providing the information to others in the community.  If what is being said is false then you may have a basis for a slander or libel suit against whoever is making such statements.  ### requires that you prove the defendant:Made a statement about you to a third-party (published);That statement was false; andAs a direct result of the publishing of that false statement, you were damaged (lost money).In the old days, all you had to do was prove someone made a false statement about you and so long as it was of a nature that would hurt one's reputation you could recover.  This was referred to as slander per se or libel per se.  That is no longer the law in Missouri.  The Missouri Supreme Court eliminated per se ### in the ###980s so now you must prove actual monetary damages.It is important to know that defamation claims are not easy to win but the filing of such a claim may help to clear up your name in the community.  One other thing you may want to consider is requesting a service letter from the employer.  I have copied and pasted the Service Letter Statute below:###90.###40.  Letter of dismissal, when â€” failure to issue, damages â€” punitive damages, limitations. â€” ###.  Whenever any employee of any corporation doing business in this state and which ### seven or more employees, who shall have been in the service of said corporation for a period of at least ninety days, shall be discharged or voluntarily quit the service of such corporation and who thereafter within a reasonable period of time, but not later than one year following the date the employee was discharged or voluntarily quit, requests in writing by certified mail to the superintendent, manager or registered agent of said corporation, with specific reference to the statute, it shall be the duty of the superintendent or manager of said corporation to issue to such employee, within forty-five days after the receipt of such request, a letter, duly signed by such superintendent or manager, setting forth the nature and character of service rendered by such employee to such corporation and the duration thereof, and truly stating for what cause, if any, such employee was discharged or voluntarily quit such service.â€ƒ ###.  Any corporation which violates the provisions of subsection ###, said employer may be liable for nominal and punitive damages; but no award of punitive damages under this section shall be based upon the content of any such letter.You should also consider contacting an employment attorney in your area that routinely represents employees to discuss your case and see what other options you may have.Good luck.43939.7819444444 You havenâ€™t actually asked a question. Iâ€™m guessing you want to know what rights you have in this situation. As an at will employee you can be discharged at anytime and for any reason or even no reason at all. So the employer is free to let you go under these circumstances even if it was based upon a misunderstanding of what had happened. The ### PD has no liability as it is a governmental entity with immunity. I donâ€™t see any basis for any recovery for you in regard to the situation. 43939.0201388889 iwas working at a local resort . and met a guy online who sent a photo to me . i didnt want it or appreciate the photo . i had stopped talking to him.

Trying to call in for help is even more aggravation.43953.4270833333 I reside in Illinois and was in process of relocating closer to new employment I just received in Missouri. I worked ONE day and was placed on ### due to COVID 19. I had not ended my current job with DORS in Illinois thank goodness. I take care of one patient only ###. The NEW job that I had just acquired is ###-###. I want to know do I qualify for unemployment due to COVID and which State do I apply. I also am having a problem since I have called ###. Thank you.43943.5604166667 I understood that was the case. I should have said that as soon as you went to work for the Missouri employer at a higher wage rate and on a full time basis you became eligible for unemployment benefits if you lost that employment. So when you were ### from there you should be entitled to benefits. Now to be honest, you are likely to be told that since you only worked a day at the new job that you the actual amount of benefits may not amount to much of anything. That is because all of your wage credits are based upon the other part time job and you are still working there. You would have been better off from an unemployment standpoint had you actually quit that job when you got the new job because then you wouldnâ€™t have have any current pay to offset against benefits. However, with the new CARES act stimulus everyone that gets unemployment benefits gets an additional $###. So if you can establish being entitled to only $### $600/week benefit. 43944.2180555556 So would I use the information with my current job in Illinois with DORS? The hours with DORS has never decreased or ended since COVID began, my hours are still the same. The patient I care for has a specific number of hours a month that he is allowed to have someone care for him and those hours have not changed. I just wanted to know if I would qualify for unemployment with my new job in Missouri working only ONE day that was suppose to be full time.43943.8125 The new employer in Missouri WAS the higher wageAND FULL TIME POSITION that I only worked one day at.43943.9055555556 You need to access the system by logging in at: https://uinteract.labor.mo.gov/benefits/home.do  Once in the system you are going to want to file an unemployment claim but select PUA claim rather than a normal claim.  If that does not allow you to submit a claim then I do not know what you can do.43956.6541666667 You would have to assert that you were hired at the new job and ### after only one day in order to be eligible for benefits.  To be clear, I am not licensed in Illinois and do not handle Illinois unemployment claims so I cannot speak to Illinois law in that regard.  I know that most states' systems are fairly consistent in order to meet the criteria needed to get the federal matching funds that are occasionally sought.  You are correct that you likely cannot get benefits based upon no change in the number of hours worked with the original employer.  However, the instant that you went to work for the new employer you then lost the benefit of the higher wage rate and the full-time status.  Based upon that I believe that you would be eligible for benefits assuming that you were working sufficient hours at the original job to qualify as an insured worker.43943.8263888889 You would likely need to file in Illinois since you wonâ€™t have any wage credits in Missouri if you were ### in the first quarter that you worked for the Missouri job. I would go ahead and file as I think you should be entitled to benefits. Good luck. 43943.6451388889 Great!  Good luck, ### Teitelbaum43958.6055555556 Hi ###.

The restaurant temporarily is closed due to Covid. I am a single mother who depends upon my second job income. Child support is severely past due and I have not received child support due to lack of payment. Fortunately I am still receiving my teachers salary. I filed unemployment for the loss of the second job in hopes to get the Cares Act funding. I have been denied state unemployment as I am still employed at the school, which I fully understand.

From what I read, sounds like you have a solid reason to file a complaint.  Note that you have the option to file a federal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or a state complaint with the Missouri Human Rights Commission.  You generally must file your complaint within ###.  If you file with the EEOC, go to this website for filing instructions:  ###  If you file with the MHRC, go to https://labor.mo.gov/mohumanrights   Regardless of which forum you choose, you should file as soon as possible.  Also, the law that covers your situation is called Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of ###, ### 2000e - 2000e17, or simply Title VII."This law covers only employers that have ###.  I only bring this up because when I read what you wrote I got the impression that the local garden shop is a small operation.  If they employ less than ### then your complaint will likely be dismissed.Finally please note that you do not need to hire an attorney when you first file a complaint.  Simply follow the instructions of either the EEOC or MHRC to file the complaint.  It's pretty user friendly and a layperson can file the initial complaint.  You'll probably have to hire an attorney however afterwards especially when the investigation begins.  Also note that discrimination complaints take a very long time to investigate.  It may be years before your case gets to court.  Your attorney can explain the process.I recognize this was a stressful situation and I hope the information I gave you was helpful.  Best wishes to you. "43946.0256944444 I'm definitely gonna follow this link and file a complaint. AFAIK the company permanently ### around ###. I do know that they qualified for a coronavirus relief grant through the state that only applies to companies with less than fifty employees, but I also know that I can name at least a dozen people or so who worked there and I didn't know everyone so I'm confident that there are more than fifty employees.I am curious though, what is the likely outcome of filing a complaint? Like I said, I'm not necessarily looking to sue them for everything they have or anything, I just feel like unfair discrimination can't go unrewarded and something must be done, if for no other reason than to keep them from doing it to someone else down the road. Any insight to how this all might shake out?Thank you for your response. It's very helpful.43947.0576388889 I've been self-employed gardening for years. I pull a tidy salary, but work is occasionally scarce. This spring I went to a local gardening shop and joined their maintenance crew.They hired me as a crew chief, in charge of a crew of ###-###, starting at $15/hour with a 6-week probationary period on another crew. Then I requested a day off on a Friday to prepare for the sabbat Ostara.After I requested a day off to prepare for Ostara, things immediately changed. I could tell I was being treated differently. I had people ask if I was Jewish because I said  sabbat". I was ### for small things (like once where my crew chief berated me for blowing out the garden in the back yard then moving to the front instead of weeding the back first then he did the front anyways). They took away my crew and I worked under other people. I wasn't trusted in the shop or warehouse alone. Once I forgot to pray before work so I prayed quickly on a jobsite. The crew chief saw me and reported it to the owner who mentioned it later. Everyone who's ranked crew chief or higher has either been with the company for 5+ years or is related to the owner by marriage or by blood.One day a dog wandered onto the property then headed out towards traffic. I was on approved break and pulled out my phone to post a picture of the dog to a lost pets Facebook group. The next morning the owner cited phone use and said that my work wasn't "up to expectations" and fired me then offered to bring me back on as a "trainee" at $10/hour. I declined because going back to ### would be more lucrative than taking a ######% pay cut.Now because of coronavirus I'm having trouble finding work. A lot of my clients from previous years hired new gardeners because I was absent throughout the early weeks of spring or just don't have the money to pay.My spouse has convinced me that were I a good ### I would still be employed and in a better place financially. They're pressing me to investigate my legal options. Would I have a discrimination case on my hands or enough to wave in their face to settle out of court? What would I go after? I don't want my job back after the way they treated me but needed guaranteed pay. I was gonna make ~$###7k/y.Also with the weather and gardening being an essential service the shop isn't lacking money. They took a small business grant from the government while reporting March as their best year for ### sales since the 19###0s. I was working 40-###. They were also actively trying to hire more crew members because we were being overworked. Also spouse and I are trying to buy a house and being self employed may hinder that as banks tend to want proof of income."43945.8277777778 There is no way to judge the likely outcome of a discrimination complaint.  Like any adversarial process, it's never a slam dunk for either the employee, or the employer.  It depends on who can present the best case. For an employee who prevails, some of the possible remedies include monetary damages or equitable relief (e.g., giving you your job back).  It is also sometimes possible for a prevailing employee to get the employer to pay for attorney's fees.  These are some of the possible outcomes the successful employee can get, either at a settlement or at an adversarial hearing before a judge.43949.8381944444 After being laid off a month, I was told I have to return to work, or forfit my job before Stay-in order expires.  I was laid off via text message due to no hours, then I was told I must return without any understanding of why considering they have not provided anything to protect us from COVID19. I was first laid off, but feeling forced to return or forfit my benefits, which I was told my employer is paying for, when asked about why now I was essential when no one else is being forced back or have been still able to work, being non manager, its what the program rules state" I asked which program to be replied of a "No Clue".  Do I have to return before ###? "43947.7479166667 From an unemployment benefits legal standpoint, getting laid off is the same as being discharged. If you are asking if you can remain off work and still receive benefits the answer is likely yes. You should recognize that if you refuse to return now the employer may well refuse to let you return later.The employer could protest benefits on the basis that you â€œrefused a suitable offer of workâ€ but that would require it making a formal work offer and when rejected submitting a formal protest. Most likely the employer received a PPP loan that requires it to get its payroll ### back to what it was in order to qualify for loan forgiveness. If you are only looking to return on ### that may not be an issue since for it to be eligible for loan forgiveness the employer only has to get its ### back up by ###. 43948.5805555556 I don't think that there are sufficiently detailed rules to be able to assert that the facility is violating the health department's orders.  I wouldn't worry about the lack of sanitizer but instead, make sure that there is sufficient soap for washing your hands.

When you were unable to return to work at that point your employer was perfectly entitled to sever your employment at that point. The fact that your employer didnâ€™t do that contradicts the notion that it is discriminating against you for your disability. Based upon what you have described, you were not eligible for unemployment benefits since you were on a leave of absence. Even if you were discharged you still would not be eligible for benefits since you arenâ€™t able to work without restrictions. The decision whether or not you are eligible for benefits isnâ€™t up to the employer but rather the Missouri Department of Employment Security (###). What you need to understand is that the law has changed and now employers are required to respond to the notices it receives from ###. I suspect that Ms. ### may have felt that you took advantage of the employerâ€™s generosity in preserving your job when you contacted your union claiming ### by the employer. While it doesnâ€™t sound like she reacted professionally, I think you will have a tough time proving that she discriminated against you. That said, if you feel that you have sufficient evidence to prove disability discrimination then you should arrange to speak with a local employment attorney to discuss the issue. 43949.9013888889 I've been off work since ### for FMLA.

I suggest asking someone to help you with this if you arenâ€™t technically knowledgeable. Quite frankly, you may not be entitled to benefits based upon your description of what happened. Not working to avoid contracting COVID-###. However, that doesnâ€™t entitle you to receive benefits. In order to get benefits you must have been ### by the employer.

If you volunteered then you would not be eligible for benefits. 43949.9243055556 Dear Attorney 95,Thank you for your help. This is my last response to you. I have not gone to that exact link  but will try it. I received a different link which took me to a five page description of all that is involved with benefits. It was long, contradictory in parts, and quite complex fully to understand.I have heard that many people are having benefits declined despite Covid-###. This is probably true. Businesses are opening much too early in my opinion as it is still unsafe due to the  virus to have people cluster together.In any case, thank you for your input. Hope you stay well.

There is a new automated message today ###) Anyone who is unemployed due to fear of illness from the COVID-###. ###) Also, if your employer calls you about a position to come back and you do not accept because the pandemic is still too threatening, your benefits will be denied or terminated.I was shocked to hear this message as I looked up the eligibility requirements for the PUA, and the first issue of fear of the pandemic is stated very clearly as an acceptable reason for eligibility. ### and Noble in Mid-Rivers stayed open this entire time despite the fact they are non-essential. There was no obligation in anything I received to return to work until I felt it was safe. I am on ### by their choice, and my position was to be saved when it was safe to return. The store was following upper management orders I am sure. By not closing and having people walk in and out, touching books, etc., while not wearing gloves or ###, they were putting both employees and patrons in jeopardy.  All this being said, I believe my appeal will be denied.

The determination is ultimately based upon who made the final call as to who was ###. The present situation is unique but the legal issue is the same as when an employer offers an incentive for folks to quit/retire prior to a RIF (reduction in force). In those cases the Division rules for the employer if it finds that the employee made the decision by accepting the offer. Alternatively, the Division rules for the employee if it finds that even though the employee accepted the offer, the employer made the final decision as to who was allowed to take it.  So the same thing will apply to accepting volunteers to be ###. The Division promptly sends out a letter acknowledging that you submitted your appeal. If you havenâ€™t received such a letter you may need to appeal again. How did you file your appeal? If you mailed it you may want to try faxing it with a statement that you are resending it since you hadnâ€™t gotten a response from when you sent it in on ### date.If you are able to access via the website that is the best thing since it has all of the information about your case status.

A legal modification for a few months is difficult. A modification must be based on the earnings of both parents and must be calculated according to child support guidelines and that or a deviation approved by the court.  As a practical matter, a modification takes some months to get thru court and may involve attorney's fees that would be difficult to raise during a layoff.You should pay as much as you can of the ordered amount. Unemployment payments and your government emergency payment will be considered. You should consider talking to your ex spouse about her agreement that you both cooperate to see lawyers about legally adjusting the arrearage after you go back to earning the original amount.If you end up with some amount owed and no cooperation, you may have to file a motion to modify child support retroactive to the date of your layoff. Or, if you are contacted by Child Support Enforcement or your ex-wife's attorney, you will likely be able to negotiate a payment on past due child support.  Garnishment is only likely if you ignore your obligation. 43954.8013888889 Hello.Working for the University of Missouri, I am concerned for my fiscal well-being and paying child support.

As an attorney we are ### prohibited from offering assistance without knowing who the other party is to ensure that there is no conflict of interest.  When you use this forum you are protected from the disclosure of the information to the opposing party by the ethical rules as there is a quasi attorney-client relationship.  Note that would not be the case in other open forums as the public can see what is said between the lawyer and the questioner.I'm willing to answer your question as I don't represent any local school districts and my answer would not impair any prior client of mine with whom you might be employed.  The normal rule is that the employer doesn't have to pay you for vacation.  We normally see this in the context of a person quitting or being discharged. In the employee handbooks that I draft I include a provision that says if you are discharged or quit with less than two (###) weeks notice you will not receive any unpaid vacation or PTO.  However if the employer's handbook states that you do get paid for such vacation or PTO then I think the school district would have a problem in denying it to folks under your situation."43952.5833333333 I work for a private school and get ### ###.

The only thing an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon you being a member of a protected class. The protected classes are race, age(40+), sex, religion, national origin and disability. So yes you can be discharged for refusing to return to work. The St. ### County stay at home order does not impact the issue.As far as unemployment is concerned, you will no longer be eligible for benefits if you refuse to return to work.

You have worked for this benefit and you should use it.  Social Security makes its own determination about whether you are entitled to benefits and it will not affect that determination.43955.6375 Shaquila, while you are on short-term disability you are still employed, so you would not be eligible form unemployment.

Should I have parents sign a waiver stating the choice to return and any unintended consequences are theirs? Would this be covered under my general business insurance?Thank you for your time,### Peleshenko43955.6555555556 To begin with you need to understand that simply contracting the virus at your business isnâ€™t sufficient to establish liability. There must be some fault on the part of the business. Additionally, it is likely difficult for anyone to prove where they contracted the virus so it may not be that significant of a concern.That said, it would be wise to have adults sign a waiver and hold harmless agreement just in case. Note that a simple waiver by a parent will not be enforceable to preclude a claim by the child as the parent lacks legal authority to act on the childâ€™s behalf. Instead you need the hold harmless and indemnification language making the parent legally obligated to repay you for any amount that the child could recover from the business. While that may not protect your business (parent likely lacks the resources to indemnify) it will strongly discourage the parent from pursuing the matter. I suggest that you contact a local business attorney to draft an appropriate agreement for the parents to sign. 43955.6722222222 The making of false statements about someone is called slander and can be the basis of a lawsuit.  However, it is important that you understand that in Missouri you must prove an actual monetary loss as a result of the slander.  In the old days, all that was needed was to make a false statement that would damage someone's reputation and damages were presumed.  This was referred to as slander per se (or libel per se if in written form).  But in the ### case in 1993, the Missouri Supreme Court eliminated per se defamation requiring that any slander or libel case prove actual monetary damages rather than presume such damages.  As a result, unless you can prove that you lost some actual money or economic benefit you cannot prevail in a slander suit.So, if all you can say is that this person said bad things about you but you didn't lose any money as a result, you cannot win your case even if people in the community believe it to be true.43955.6965277778 my ex boss told the other employees that I was fired for stealing a whole shifts money drops.

Secondly, this is all kind of new to us attorneys as well. I would direct your attention to the Families First Coronovirus Response Act, enacted by the Federal Government to see if you may qualify for protection under the Act. Federal Register - Families First Coronovirus Response Act - here is a link to the language and explanations to date.  Here is a question and answer section to look at as well.  Department of Labor - Questions and Answers .  In your particular case you may want to see if your doctor would recommend continued self-quarantine because you are a vulnerable person and a co-worker was positive.  If you qualify under this section it can provide you federally protected leave for up to ###.  You could also talk with your human resources department and ask them for the information regarding EPLSA and EFMLEA. If they ask you to return I would certainly tell them of your concerns and ask about your options. Lastly, I would recommend that if you are asked to come back to work before responding, contact an attorney in your area that s###fically deals with employee/employer rights issues.  Any attorney that handles FMLA, disability, and other types of employment claims is normally your best bet.  I hope this provides you some initial guidance but if you have any further questions please do not hesitate to reach out again.  ### R. ### ###, ###, & ###, ###  43956.7638888889 ###, thank you very much for all the information.

Iâ€™ve made this company hundreds of thousands of dollars.  43958.7659722222 You are almost certainly an at-will employee and as such, you can be discharged at any time and for any reason or even no reason at all.  The only thing that an employer may not do is make employment decisions based upon you being a member of a protected class.  The protected classes are based on race, age (40+), sex, religion, national origin, and disability.  So unless you can establish that you were selected based upon your being a member of a protected class it is doubtful that you have a case for a lawsuit.  Seniority is not a factor in this determination but the fact that you are higher paid could be a substitute for age unless the other individual that you referenced is also 40+ years old.  I would also point out that under the current circumstances it is likely going to be difficult to convince a judge or jury that such an employment decision was based upon an illegal discriminatory basis.  The fact that the employer hired ### ###.The bottom line is if you feel that you have a basis for pursuing a discrimination case then you should arrange to meet with a local employment attorney that primarily represents employees rather than employers.  These cases have very short timeframes in which you must take action so if you intend to pursue the matter you should do so promptly.43958.6798611111 You didn't mention before that you were an ### American so that could be another basis of potential discrimination. It is quite possible that the decision to ### you was in fact based upon you being a member of a protected class. You simply need to understand that the mere fact that you were let go instead of someone else, standing alone, isn't likely to be enough to establish discrimination.  I did make the assumption in my analysis that there was a business need to reduce payroll since presently that is almost ### true for small businesses. If that is not the case with your employer that would add support to a claim of discrimination.Again, if you feel based upon the underlying facts of which you are aware that this was done because you are black or because of your age or some combination thereof then you may well have a viable claim and should schedule an appointment with an employment attorney as I mentioned before.43958.8173611111 Attorney 95-Thank you very much for your response.  I know this is still a new and fluid situation but I am a bit confused on how unemployment works exactly.So, ### determines unemployment eligibility, correct?

Please note, that I am not riding the unemployment train but am wanting as much information as possible so if and when this happens I am informed.

As for how much time does an employer have to give you before returning to work, there is no such time frame established. You are incorrect, however, in your characterization of the business dropping you from unemployment as that determination is made by the Missouri Department of Employment Security (###).  Having laid you off you are entitled to benefits.  If you are offered a suitable offer of work and refuse it then you will likely be denied benefits from that point forward with some caveats.  For example, if the employer offers you the position and insists that you return immediately or decide immediately that may not be considered reasonable on the part of the Division.  Additionally, there could be an argument that the job is not suitable as it is substantially different from the job that you had before.  That argument could be made on the basis that without table service you would be deprived of the level of tips associated with the prior work.  Alternatively, you can still claim unemployment even if you return to work for the employer if the hours are significantly reduced from the level of hours that you had worked previously.  You don't have to be completely unemployed in order to be eligible for benefits.  For example, if you are working ###-time by the employer and only work ###.Hopefully the above answers your questions and concerns.43959.7069444444 Thank you.  It is a nerve wracking question.  The establishment I am referring to Trezo Mare restaurant.  43958.9590277778 The reason you are being asked to provide the name of the opposing party is so the attorney can determine if he/she has a conflict of interest. We are ### prohibited from assisting someone who has interests diverse of a current or former client. No lawyer is going to share the fact that you inquired with your former employer but I cannot answer your questions without confirming that Iâ€™ve never represented them. 43958.8944444444 Under the statutory scheme simply means the unemployment statutes. Basically I was merely pointing out that employers are now obligated to submit protests if appropriate to apprise the division of the underlying facts so it can decide if someone is eligible for benefits under the statutes.You also asked the contract question separately and I have already answered it. I do not understand what the employer is attempting to do by asking you all to sign a contract either.43963.8722222222 Unemployment taxes are assessed against employers and do not come out of employee pay. The tax rate is based on the employerâ€™s track record. So an employerâ€™s tax rate goes up when benefits are awarded but can go down when the business has fewer claims that result in benefits. Because of that it is important for employers to protest claims where appropriate.  Additionally, the law has changed and now requires employers to cooperate and submit protests where appropriate to assist ### in ensuring that only those entitled under the statutory scheme get benefits. 43961.7895833333 I am ###. I am diabetic, I have multiple ###, a blood ### disorder, and a monitored brain aneurysm. I have worked for the same employer almost ###.

I have never been on disability although my doctors have strongly encouraged it.We have been off with pay for about ### 18th but now have been called back on the ###.   My question is, what are my rights when I return to work? The governor said if we're called back, we have to go unless we fall under ###, which I do not. I'm a little worried to return due to my comorbidities.  Could I take FMLA  or could I take a leave of absence without being fired? I need to stay employed because of my insurance. I have made numerous calls and sent e-mails all of which were never answered. I have searched the Internet and can't find any answers to my particular situation. What are my rights? Thanks for any help.43959.7590277778 I think you should be eligible for FMLA under these circumstances but you won't be eligible to be paid.  While on FMLA your job is protected for up to ###. You may also be able to seek protection under the ### based upon your being particularly at risk of serious complications if you contract COVID-19.You may also want to take this opportunity to consider pursuing social security disability as recommended by your physicians.43959.8833333333 Sorry. I have not spoken with my employer yet and Idont want to lose my job. ### County Public Library.43959.8263888889 You failed to indicate who the employer is so no lawyer can answer your question.  Our legal ethics rules require us to perform a conflicts check before accepting any representation to ensure that we are not about to represent someone with interests adverse to a current or prior client.  You need not be concerned about an attorney disclosing your inquiry to the employer as that would also be a violation of the ethical rules.  Once you provide me with the name of the employer I can answer your question.43959.7909722222 I had been working for a printshop (Speciality papers and supplies) when co-vid shut ### began. I was informed that I was a core employee and shouldn't worry but that I would be cut back to ###. The following week I showed up for my shift and the floor manager asked what I was doing there. I reminded him of what he told me the previous week. He then indicated there wasn't enough work that evening and I should wait for a call to let me know when there was work for me. In the mean time I have been doing part time work with a home health care agency still reserving time for potential work at the print shop. Fast forward to ###, I received a letter from ### & ### agency informing me that I might need to apply for COBRA because my coverage under the plan at the print shop ended ###-###. I did not terminate my employment and was never told I was terminated. Thru no fault of my own I now feel the need to scramble to make other arrangements for health care coverage. Is there any accountability on the part of my employer in this ### to have better prepared me for this? Can I apply for back unemployment?43959.8638888889 You were eligible to seek unemployment as soon as your employer stopped/reduced your hours worked so you did not have to wait. What I can tell you is that the Missouri Division of Employment Security does not provide any mechanism for receiving benefits retroactively.  I can appreciate your frustration but there isn't really anything that you can do about any of this.43959.8895833333 Hello Ms. ###,I will try to point you in the right direction for dealing with the problem you described.  I am really not an expert regarding the Covid-###. Since these laws are so new, very few attorneys are.  I believe you may be covered by a new federal law referred to as FFCRA.  The full name for that law is Families First Coronavirus Response  Act:  Employer Paid Leave Requirements."   This law is enforced by the Department of ### Wage and Hours Division.  You can check out their site on the Internet by Googling "###."  I also saw a phone number which was 1-866-4-US-WAGE.  I would suggest that you contact the Wage and Hours Division to inquire about your situation.  If anyone can help you I believe those people can.I know you must be frustrated.  I believe that many people are during these difficult times.  I hope you find some assistance from the government agency I suggested. Best of luck."43961.78125 I work at Dollar General here in Grant City, Missouri. My dad has cancer - I'm his caretaker.

I am sorry to hear about your condition; this is surely a tough time to be without health benefits and income.  I have tried to answer your question below and hope that it is helpful.  The short answer is yes, it may have been legal for your employer to deny you a leave of absence.  However, depending on the circumstances, you may be entitled to file a claim with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission for disability discrimination.  You may also be entitled to file a workersâ€™ compensation claim if your injury is related to the work you performed at your job.  I have discussed the laws relevant to this issue below.  After the legal discussion, I have made a few recommendations for next steps you could take. In North Carolina employment is â€œat-will,â€ which means an employer has a lot of discretion to retain or terminate employees, so long as they are not violating any specific law. North Carolina does not require that employers provide any sort of sick leave, paid or unpaid, however, employers must provide leave under federal law. The FMLA entitles eligible employees up to ###. Unfortunately, when an employee uses the ###, in most cases, an employee can be fired from their job. Under the FMLA, there is no right to be reinstated to job once you run out of FMLA leave.Under Â§8###5.######6, once FMLA runs out an employer does not have to restore the employeeâ€™s job if denial is (###) necessary to prevent the substantial and grievous economic damage to the operation or (###) the employee fails to give a â€œ###â€ certificate if necessary (see FMLA Â§8###5.###). Additionally, a job does not have to be restored if the employee is unable to perform an â€œessential functionâ€ of the position because of a physical condition, including the continuation of a serious health condition or an injury covered by workers' compensation. Also, the employee has no right to restoration to another position under the FMLA. Under the FMLA, since you have used all our ###, your employer has likely not violated the FMLA by terminating your employment.  Under the Americanâ€™s Disability Act (â€œ###â€), even if FMLA leave is used up, a person who qualifies under the ### can be entitled to additional leave, so long as it is reasonable.  This is known under the ### as a â€œreasonable accommodation.â€  Generally, an employer must make an accommodation for a disabled employee that qualifies under the ###, as long as the accommodation is reasonable.  This can include additional leave or other measures, like modification of a work schedule, providing tools or equipment that would allow the employee to perform her duties, or reassignment to an open position.   Depending on the facts, some Courts have allowed up to ###, however, denying leave cannot cause an undue burden to the employer. An undue burden essentially means that holding the job open for the employee to return would cause the employer a significant difficulty or expense. To determine if leave is reasonable there are several factors that can be considered including: the size of the employer, the number and location of its facilities, the cost of the accommodation, its financial resources, the impact the accommodation would have on its employees and the employerâ€™s ability to conduct its business. An employee with a disability who seeks leave under the employerâ€™s regular leave policy is entitled to whatever form of leave the employer generally gives to its employees, as long as the employee meets any eligibility requirement. Under the ###, the employer is in its right to terminate if it is an undue burden â€“ causes significate difficulty or expense â€“ to allow the employee to take leave.  But an employer must engage in a good faith dialogue with the employee in order to determine whether a reasonable accommodation can be made. Here are some suggestions for next steps: If you havenâ€™t already, provide your employer with a letter from your doctor regarding the additional surgery, recovery time/therapy needed, and when you would be able to return to your job. Also consider asking your doctor to state whether you could perform other jobs. Ask your employer for a detailed explanation in writing of why the leave request was not granted.Ask for an in-person meeting with your employer to discuss your leave request and why it was not granted.Ask if there are other reasonable accommodations that could be made.  For instance, could there be a shorter leave followed by a reduced work schedule to allow for physical therapy or other recovery?  Is there another position open that you could be ### to that you could perform even with your leg condition?  Your employer must have a good faith discussion with you to see whether any reasonable accommodations can be made. If your injury is related to the work you performed for your job, consider making a workersâ€™ compensation claim. If after taking these steps you feel you may need to speak with an attorney to make a claim, you can contact NC Legal Aid at ###-866-###, or you can contact the NC Bar Associationâ€™s  Lawyer Referral Service at ###-800-###, and for $### 30-minute initial consultation with an attorney who practices employment law. 43930.6902777778 I am a transit driver and begin having problems with my leg. My job told me to stop work and get myself better because it was my right leg. Dr. took me out of work had surgery and need another. I got approve for FMLA that ran out and request a LOA but was denied and the reason was, â€œthat business needs cannot support a leave request at this time.â€ It was done by manager & Human Resources manager.  My question is can my job deny me a Leave of Absence? So I was fired, now I have no health benefits, life insurance nor a job. Is this legal?43899.6583333333 In NC a police officer that retires not only receives the local government retirement but they also receive a supplement from the city they worked at until the age of 62. If a officer retires from the agency in good accord but itâ€™s a disability retirement wouldnâ€™t they still be able to receive this supplement? 43899.7993055556 Can you sue a company for pain and suffering for job related illness?43899.8104166667 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  Lawyers, based on how we are trained to think about legal problems, cannot answer a hypothetical, academic question like the one you posed, without ### facts.  Pain and suffering damages typically are not recoverable at law outside of personal injury or other serious injury cases, where the plaintiff has suffered some physical or serious psychological harm due to a wrongful act (negligent or intentional) by the defendant.  I do not have any facts to go on from your posting, so it would be difficult for me to offer anything beyond this general answer.  If you wish to follow up with a brief summary of what happened that led you to post this question, perhaps I can offer you a more helpful answer.  I hope all is well for you and your family as spring comes upon us. Best regards.43899.8180555556 Ms. ###:Thank you for your follow up.  While it appears that you were treated unfairly due to workplace ### and maybe even ###, there is nothing in these facts that suggests justification for a lawsuit.  Assuming you were an at-will employee, you can be fired in NC at any time, for any reason, or for no reason stated.  Exceptions include illegal discrimination under federal law--based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability or age if over 40--or violation of public policy, such as retaliation against an employee based on that employee's engaging in a legally protected activity.  Your termination as you described it here does not appear to fall under any category of illegal or actionable conduct.  It may have been unfair, but it appears to be legally proper.I wish I had better news to share with you.  Please feel free to consult with a local employment law attorney if you desire a second opinion based on a more thorough grounding in the facts than appears on this site, but I doubt that anything legal can be done about this.Blessings and best wishes to you.  I hope your employment situation improves very, very shortly.43899.9909722222 On ###th I went on FMLA due to stress of the then supervisor. Upon my return on ###th  i was made aware that she was no longer with the company. Before my move to home office i was in the Burlington office. Upon my return I notice my colleagues were acting differently towards me. The seem to not want to be seen talking to me and kept a distance. I also noticed that my leadership was not so welcoming upon my return. Home office was a very uninviting place. I had asked my VP if I may return to the Burlington office and explained why to her. She refused and said they wanted me at this location. They have not been supportive of me every since they had to let the supervisor go. My stress level started to go back up. I have never had a corrective action until I was under another supervisor while they filled the position of a new Work Base Learning supervisor. I did my job to the best of my ability without proper training or mentorship. I have been feeling that they wanted me out of the company because they had to let the supervisor go. I put my notice in on ###st. They ended up paying me the two weeks and said i didn't have to return. I have been singled and pushed out of an organization i loved. I am still seeing a therapist and Psychiatrist for the actions of the leadership. I took notes starting in ###. I really want to know if I have some sort of case. 43899.8465277778 Also the nc dol statute of limitation is ###. Please advise.43900.75 Good afternoon, Ms. ###:Thank you for your question.  I am sorry you have to deal with this situation, as I am sure you worked hard for your money.  Yes, you can file a small claims suit against your employer in the county where it is located as long as you do so within three (###) years from the date that it breached its obligations to you to issue checks that you can successfully cash or deposit.  The filing fee is $###, and the service of process fee for the summons is $###0.  You can find both forms at the local courthouse (Clerk of Superior Court's office) or at ###.Also, you can file a complaint for free with the North Carolina Department of Labor, and they will investigate your former employer and compel them to respond, on penalty of being fined or worse.  It has been my prior experience in helping clients that this is a very effective route of redress, and I encourage you to take it up--especially if some of your past checks are now more than three (###) years out.Hope this helps you somewhat, and I hope you get your ### money very soon.  Have an enjoyable North Carolina spring.43900.7201388889 I tried to cash ### $###.### ###. The checks were returned due to closed account and my old employer will not ### them. The checks were issued in 2017. What are my chances of winning my case if I file through small claims. Is there a statute of limitation? 43900.7006944444 Ms. ###:You are very welcome.  I would argue that it would be three years from the date you unsuccessfully cashed the check, since that would be a clear establishment of breach although be prepared for the former employer to argue that it was from the date of issuance, since that statute of limitations defense would work to its favor, and might actually cause the claim to be dismissed in court, regardless of how meritorious your claim would otherwise be.That's why, also, the NC DOL route is so attractive; it is not a lawsuit governed by statutes of limitations, and it costs you nothing to file the complaint.  You should see a link on the NC DOL site when you browse online.  Employers do not like to get in trouble with the state, so they usually respond when the DOL comes knocking (### speaking).Best wishes!43900.7388888889 My goodness.  Sorry to hear what you heard from NC DOL.  I would say at this point, based on the limited knowledge I have from this exchange, that your chances of prevailing in small claims here in NC would be about 60-###.  Whether that is enough of good risk given the relatively small amount of money involved is really a decision you have to make for yourself.  I wish this were easier for you to pursue, as I believe you have been treated unfairly.Thank you for your courtesy and professionalism.43900.7548611111 Thank you for the prompt response. Due to the high volume of complaints, they will not accept complaints for wages due more than one year ago.I live in ### now and it is inconvenient and difficult to go to small claims if I know my case will be dismissed. If my chances of winning are high, I would like to file.43900.7479166667 Thank you so much for your response. To clarify, is ###. The bank told me there is no time limit to cashing them and they were returned due to the account being closed. I appreciate any assistance youâ€™re able to provide me and I look forward to hearing back from you soon. Thank you again!43900.7319444444 ### company and its employees have discriminated against me and my religious headwear.  I was harassed multiple times with signing a leave of absence paperwork. I assured them that it wasnâ€™t in there policy for me to do so but they insisted on making me sign the paperwork anyway. After I finally made it a point that they were harassing me. They completely changed the subject from me signing paperwork to the time of my voice with customers and I havenâ€™t even started the official job. I let them know that I had pictures of others who also wore things on the head not for religious purposes and Iâ€™m almost sure if I ### shown her the pictures I ### been fired. I have a ###. I filled a complaint with the Eeoc and they are under investigation. Unfortunately I donâ€™t have the money most of the lawyers are looking for to try my case. They continue to go down on their pricing becauseâ€ they want me caseâ€ but I just do not have the funds upfront for them. This started Dec. ###  when I felt uneasy. I was still awarded the job but I had to take extra assessments that no one else had to do. I also got into arguing matches with two of the ladies due to the matter. All while others are safe without problem wearing bonnets and hats. 43901.7652777778 This is problem that appears frequently.  Lawyers do not want to take an EEO case on contingency basis, its just too chancy, as there is no way to figure out what the chances are of winning.  Getting up front money is almost always required. This has nothing to do with the accuracy, ### or wrongness of your situation.  No one should have to go through what you have gone through. It is just the type of thing the EEO prohibits.  While I like the facts in your case and the video sounds ### I cannot advise you to engage an attorney unless you can afford to loose all the money you spend to engage them.  Also, the amount you might be able to win is dependent on your damages, and since you got the job, albeit in terrible circumstances, the amount of damages is relatively low.  For most people if they have that much money hanging around, there are much better things to spend it on. with your job. Good luck 43927.8652777778 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for your question.  I believe you posted this exact question on ### Q&A forum a couple days back, and the answer is the same: if your workers compensation lawyer wishes to handle only the WC aspect of this case, you need to independently consult with an employment law attorney for a very close look at the sequence of facts leading up to your termination.  As I told you on Avvo, your ### and suspicions of retaliation are ### and credible, but attorneys, based on how we are trained in law school to be ###, are not simply going to tell you for certain whether a case exists based on a few sentences posted on a website.  Any attorney who is thoughtful and ethical is going to want to discuss this with you, either by phone, ### or in person, before ### out a certain opinion about whether you have enough ammunition to mount a case.  I can understand why posting on multiple websites is more attractive to you than investing time (and possibly money, in the form of consultation fees) in actual consultations, but again, attorneys are conservative and limited in their opinions when they do not know all facts, and have not had the chance to ask the client questions and conduct a thorough dialogue.  We are not trying to be difficult or playing hard to get; that is simply how we are trained to think.I hope that further consultation with employment law counsel will add to your clarity, and if necessary, facilitate your obtaining compensation, reinstatement, or any other relief appropriate to making you whole.  I wish you the very best this spring.43906.9083333333 Iâ€™m on WC I was referred to a neurosurgeon. While waiting on the neurosurgeon visit I received a letter saying Iâ€™ve been terminated because they didnâ€™t know if I wanted to return which is a lie. I filed for LTD on ###-### ###-###. I wonder if I have a case?43906.8861111111 ###,This must be very stressful, and understandably confusing.If your employer had ###, they would be covered by federal COBRA, which requires providing notice of how a former employee can continue group health insurance at the employee expense after employment ends.  For employers with less than ###, NC has a similar law.  When coverage ends (the last day of employment, or some date later), depends upon the exact terms of the employer's group health Plan.43927.8236111111 I was let go from a company ###, I still had access to the insurance, and was never notified about my policy ending until ###. I had a preventative apt. ###, medical office verified insurance was still active at that point. Iâ€™ve just been notified by the drs office the insurance is saying I lost coverage on ###. The employer does not have an HR Dept and didnâ€™t give me any information or exit paperwork. According to www.ncdoi.com employers must provide some kind of paperwork, and that unless there is notification insurance coverage canâ€™t end same day, typically goes to the next billing cycle. The insurance company has clearly back dated the date of coverage ending. Iâ€™m not sure what to do or who to speak to about any of this. Itâ€™s very confusing. 43914.8631944444 Good afternoon, Carlotta:Thank you for your question.  While I do not know much about this situation based on a very brief, one-sentence summary, you should be aware that if you are an at-will employee (as most employees in North Carolina are), you can be terminated at any time, for any reason, or for no reason stated; this is true even when the termination is unfair from the employee's point of view (and even when the employee rightly believes that the termination was unfair).  Exceptions to this include illegal discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability or age (if over 40), or violation of public policy (such as illegal retaliation, for example).  If you believe that illegal conduct occurred on the part of your employer, you need to soon consult with an employment law attorney, who can give you specific guidance on whether you can sue your employer, or privately demand a concession through an attorney, short of a lawsuit.  But if your main contention is that you should not have been fired for going down to ### in your down time, I personally agree with you, but as a lawyer, I can at the same time say that your employer's actions are legal even if they are unfair.Unless I have missed something very big here, due to the brief posting, that would be the beginning and end of any legal analysis of this issue.Blessings to you and your family this spring.  May you all have the strength, resources, good cheer, gratitude, strength of character and peace of mind to get through this to a better place.43916.9159722222 I was terminated for driving to ### this past weekend on my Days off witch was Saturday and Sunday 43916.7972222222 Good evening, Ms. ###:I hope you are well during the Covid-###, and I appreciate your posting such a detailed fact summary on NC Free Legal Answers.  I am very sorry to read of this situation at the law firm, as I know from my pre-lawyer experiences working for other people that few things in life can make a person more miserable than a terrible supervisor.  I have certainly had at least one or two supervisors I did not like, so I ### with your anger at being unappreciated and ###inated--especially at this already-uncertain time.However, from a legal standpoint, I do not see anything from my close read of your lengthy summary that would lead me to believe, as a lawyer, that you would have a ### claim for wrongful ###ination.  As you probably know already due to your legal knowledge from paralegal training, you are an at-will employee unless you have a written contract to the contrary, and absent illegal discrimination (based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability or age if over 40) or violation of public policy (such as ### employees for engaging in legally protected activities such as ### complaints, testifying in court, or meeting with co-workers to discuss employment conditions, just to name three common examples of violation of public policy), an employer can ###inate you at any time, for any reason, or for no reason stated.  This is true even when the ###ination is unfair.  I think you were treated very badly, and wish not only that you still had a job presently, but that you had one with a law firm with better people who would appreciate what you have to offer the organization.  That is very different, however, from concluding that you have a legal claim.  Unless I have missed something here that would strongly suggest or confirm illegal discrimination of violation of public policy, there is no claim here.  I do believe that since you were not at fault, you may qualify for unemployment benefits if that is needed for the short ### as you seek to ### your situation.  I hope that a law firm in your area that has increased demand can soon find use for your intellect and competence.God bless you and your family during this challenging time.  I hope all lands well for you and yours.43916.9722222222 I was hired in ###, ### and Haigler and The ### Law Firm. I have worked in Personal Injury for ### ###/###. When I came into the firm it was easy to see there was multiple issues. I had to learn the new way obviously a new firm. But the only person that could train me was a CNA and she couldnâ€™t tell me much. I learned by doing and then getting screamed at by ### Haigler when I didnâ€™t do it his way. He would have conference calls to embarrass me in front of the entire office by degrading me. I also learned fairly quickly that the office was about a year behind on all the demand packages that needed to go out which added more pressure to what I had to do daily. I had to answer to ### Haigler daily on any cases that were in negotiation and when I was hired I was advised I would be working for ### ### that was not the case at all. Last Friday I realized I had made a mistake on ###. I immediately owned up to mistake and explained myself. I worked all day Monday then ### pulled me in the conference room and told me that ### would no longer work with me. I argued that a lot of the issues were here when I was walked in the door. Not only did I get fired when I wasnâ€™t properly trained, not given credit for what I had done for the firm and got fired in the middle of a pandemic. I want to know if I have any basis for wrongful termination. There is a lot more to this story and multiple previous employees and current employees that can speak to the abuse that ### Haigler does to his employees. 43916.8805555556 I have a Feb. ###-related felony conviction from an incident in ###. ###.  I am serving probation and have participated in intensive in-patient treatment program and continuing voluntary out-patient treatment.   I recently interivewed for a job with Edmentum, an educational services company, as an remote-based curriculum developer.  I was offered a job; upon the job offer, at which time they had not run a background check, I informed them of my drug conviction; literally thirty minutes later they rescinded the job offer.  I then requested a ### Light review/individual assessment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of ###.  The offer was made and rescinded on ### as was my request for the ### Light Review.   It is important to note that I have been hired and am employed in similar positions, though they have been part-time and project-based, since my conviction and so do not see why now why my background is an issue for this particular company; I am not directly interacting with students and furthermore, the nature of my crime does not impact my ability to perform my job, nor is denying my employment a business necessity.

The facts you stated here are deeply troubling, and very likely constitute sex discrimination.

The only exceptions to these requirements is if the employee has been arrested, indicted, or otherwise subject to criminal process for reasons relating to the cash shortage.Additionally, even if the above requirements are met, an employer may not deduct wages if doing so would mean that the employee is paid less than the minimum wage for all hours worked, or, if the employee worked overtime hours during the week in question, less than time and one-half for overtime hours worked.Has your employer received written authorization from you before deducting from your paychecks?

Yes, the language and provision you attached is legal.  While it is a lot more detailed and thorough than many other background check authorizations/waivers of privacy I typically see in most job applications, this is perfectly legal.  In fact, it is very similar to the authorization I had to sign in order to take the bar exam and become a licensed attorney.  I do not usually see these kinds of authorizations for non-licensed, non-regulated jobs, but that does not mean that the company you are applying with cannot use this.

If you are in need of legal services, you should engage a local lawyer to provide such. 43979.0027777778 ###,Sorry to hear this. That is a difficult situation. You are asking the right questions and my firm sees many people in that spot. It depends on a multitude of factors whether you are entitled to a larger severance or faced wrongful termination. Frankly, we (NC law firms) are seeing a lot of this. Typically, employment firms start with investigating whether you fit into a wrongful termination lawsuit (discrimination, etc.). If not, we would do our best to negotiate a better severance package on your behalf (look into employment history, policies, etc.). For starters, I advise you file for unemployment (even severance pending). You are able to go back and attempt to elicit a counter offer from your employer. However, we are seeing employers tighten" greatly due to the pandemic (ie they are willing to risk litigation over a better settlement due to cash flow). The offer does seem low for your time in the company depending on salary location etc. (but it really is all over the place with what employers are willing to offer). It is highly unlikely the company is required to provide you with any severance period. Worst case scenario we advise people to take it after consulting employment attorneys (this of course falls under pro bono and limited facts scenarios). Outplacement is likely something they would extend over increased cash. I recommend going through a full consultation if you believe there is real merit to adverse employment actions taken. Feel free to reach out directly. ### ###www.###lawfirm.com"43949.0125 I have been recently terminated from my employer (almost ###), and have been offered a severance package. It states a lump sum will be provided for eight weeks of pay plus a referral service for new employment. It has the Older Worker's Benefit Protection Act of ###, and states I must respond within ### (###th). If I accept this offer, no future claims maybe made and a confidentiality agreement will be enforced. If I decide not to accept this offer, can I request additional compensation? If I reject this offer, is the company required to extend the offer or nullify it all together? What other options do I have under the law? If I decide that I do not want Outplacement Services" and would like additional compensation may I request it from the company. After almost seven years of service this offer seems rather inadequate. This offer is especially miniscule considering the current health crisis this country is facing. The company is offering additional coverage for COBRA benefits this will be for two months after all primary ones are depleted. The document also states that if a claim is to be made (not addressed in the separation letter) written correspondence should be submitted. If the agreement is to be accepted all rights to sue will be waived and the agreement is final. I feel that the offer is a "good faith gesture" however it does not provide the ability to securely care for my family (or my own needs). Is there some Act of ### or legislation that has been drafted since this epidemic has overtaken this country that will provide additional support? Facing my family with fear and uncertainty does not work well for my household. I have worked my entire adult life and have never been overwhelmed like this before. The current administration for NC has unlocked new provisions for unemployed civilians and I can't imagine that this offer being made is adequate compensation. Please inform me of what other measures I can take "other than filing for benefits through ESC". This request is solely directed to the employer from which I have been terminated.

Sent medical documentation in showing that I started the job with my health well managed and it got worse with increased work load, stress, and reduced staff. My employer's attorney turned all of my responses against me in the first appeal phone hearing. My doctor who could corroborate all of the difficulties I went through with my employer, but had another patient appointment at the time of the hearing and couldn't be my witness. So I had zero representation. For the second appeal to the Board, my doctor submitted a timeline document from my medical records showing the decline in my health and all that we were doing to improve it. Without more staff being added at work, and being out of paid leave, I had to leave to preserve my health, as it seemed nothing would be changing to alleviate the work load without more staff. I also submitted our HR representative's phone number so that the Board could verify the high employee turnover over the past ### ###/###.

This might depend on the reasons for your objection to work at night: if you have a ### basis to believe that showing up to work at night violates a statewide or local stay-at-home" order still in effect or to believe that even if you are legally allowed to work that the employer's social distancing policies are not sufficient to reasonably protect you from being infected with the coronavirus you might have a valid claim against your employer based on an OSHA regulation regarding workplace safety.  You would need an employment law specialist in order to confirm this and if you consult with a local employment law attorney in or near your hometown and s/he believes that a legitimate OSHA issue exists s/he can send a letter of warning to the employer.Otherwise if you are an at-will employee and your only objection is that you are unavailable to work because the nighttime hours are inconvenient for your situation yes the employer may lawfully require you over your objection and terminate you if you do not comply.  This is the nature of at-will employment in which the employee can be terminated at any time for any reason or for no reason stated so long as the termination does not constitute illegal discrimination or violation of public policy.I hope this helps add clarity to your thinking as you deliberate how to handle this situation.

I think that you should contact a ### employment law attorney within the next week or so, and request an initial consultation on this matter.  My understanding is that, as of ###, the ### who receive bailout support cannot make MAJOR staffing changes or pay cuts through ###20; I do not think it literally means that no employees can be terminated at all, which would probably be too strict a standard for the supported businesses to be able to perfectly honor.  However, I also know from studying other relief programs that have ### out over the past few weeks, that Treasury regulations about how to specifically interpret certain provisions of the law are still being clarified as we speak, and some areas are still ###, which has made lawyers' job in advising business owners quite difficult.  Much of the Covid-###, and so a lot of the responsibility in clarifying the vague parts of the law (such as the one that bears upon your situation) falls on the Department of the Treasury rather than ###.  This is one of the unfortunate downsides of relief legislation written so quickly as this one.My preliminary opinion, based on what I have read about the bailout legislation, is that as long as you were an at-will employee, AND as long as your termination was not part of a broader staffing shakeup, your termination would be legal, even if it were based on ###, workplace ###, ###, etc., that can often occur at many workplace settings.  This assumes of course that no illegal discrimination took place under federal law--ie., based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability or age if over 40--or violation of public policy (such as retaliation for engaging in legally protected activities).  Generally speaking, even without the Covid-###, unfair" does not always mean "wrongful" termination in the eyes of the law.Nonetheless I do think that your situation is serious enough that a follow-up consultation with an employment law attorney who can provide you more detailed guidance than this website is designed for.

You are not personally responsible for the corporation's debt simply because you own ten percent (10%), or any percentage, of the corporation's stock.  A shareholder, simply by being a shareholder alone, does not equal personal liability for corporate debts.  This assumes of course, that the owners/shareholders have not personally guaranteed any loans or other debts accruing to the corporation.  While this may have happened in the case of the founder/president, it appears that you have not made any personal guarantees as the minority owner.  If that assumption is correct, you are not personally responsible for the described debts.If you are a board of directors member, you have a special, fiduciary duty to make wise oversight decisions as to any loans undertaken in the corporation's name, and so long as you are exercising good judgment to help the corporation survive, you are protected from liability by what is called the business judgment rule which allows board members to make tough decisions, and sometimes fail, without being personally liable for those decisions.  When board members are well informed and acting in good faith towards the corporation in voting on loans, major ### and other material decisions at the board level, they will be protected from any liability arising from a lawsuit over such board decisions, so long as there is no gross negligence, self-dealing or corrupt acts by the board member(s) in question.If the corporation must dissolve due to economic stress, the corporation bylaws and the NC Corporation Act (N.C.G.S. Chapter 55) will govern the dismantling of the entity, first by paying off the corporation's outstanding debts and claims, and then, once the corporation is free and clear of any outstanding obligations, by a final disbursement to the shareholders/owners, according to both ownership percentage and class of stock (i.e., preferred, or common stock).This is a brief overview of what I think are the key issues in your situation, although if I have missed something important at this preliminary stage, please let me know.  As a shareholder, be sure that you are following the board's actions with respect to financials very carefully (assuming you are not on the board in addition to being a shareholder).Blessings and best wishes to you.43960.6875 I was given ownership stock by my employer because the company could not afford to give me a pay raise.

You would have been required to file a claim in that company's bankruptcy.  The deadline for filing a claim is ###, which was on ###, so ###. The bankruptcy petition indicates that the company has no assets to pay claims beyond the expenses of the bankruptcy, so it is unlikely you would receive any payment.If you worked directly for Mr. ###, then you properly filed a claim in the chapter ###. However, with his death, as you note the chapter ###. If it is dismissed, then in the case of personal debts, a creditor files a claim once the personal estate is being administered, sometimes called probate. That proceeding would be filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court in Wake County. The proceedings are governed by North Carolina General Statutes, chapter ###.Please let me know whether you have any remaining questions.Sincerely,### J.

It will take a while to get through to them, but you should be able to fix it. 43979.5166666667 I filed for unemployment a little over a month ago and was approved. Just one day ago I received paperwork that there w going to be a hearing from my past employer trying to appeal the unemployment. Just today I received the paperwork specifying that the appeal is because the employer has never hired me and has no record of my employment. I went back and saw that I had, in fact, file my unemployment incorrectly and had selected the incorrect employer. I am trying to correct this issue as soon as possible but I am now concerned that I will be accused of fraud since I have obtained unemployment benefits. I know I'll have to pay back the money I have received from benefits. I just want to know if I should be concerned that will be accused and charged of unemployment fraud?43974.0840277778 Hi ###,Generally, part-time employees might be able to qualify for unemployment benefits if they have earned enough money in their base period to receive benefits.

You are right in both respects.  Consider filing a wage complaint with the North Carolina Department of Labor.  I went to the website ahead of you in order to include the link below:###You can consider contacting the employer one last time to tell them that you are about to report them to NC DOL if you think that will prove ###; otherwise, you can go straight to NC DOL without notifying the employer ahead of time.  I leave that to your discretion.I am sorry you are having to deal with this; some employers are more reasonable and fair than others.Wishing you a safe and healthy summer, and a stable and even ### time despite Covid-19.  Be well.43978.1055555556 I recently quit my job when my employer accused me of stealing and suspended me before I could show them proof I didnâ€™t steal. I quit in the middle of the day and still had two jobs left for that day. They said in an email they would ### my pay of those two jobs and now they will not give me my pay check stub. I am commission based so I canâ€™t even tell if I got paid correctly or if they ###ed my pay.There is a website that we are suppose to use to get our stubs but I have never been able to get it to work even after working there for 6+ months. I even went as far as to call their IT support but they still couldnâ€™t get it to work for me. The manager has always emailed me the paystubs instead of trying to resolve the issue.What should my course of action be? Iâ€™m pretty sure ###ing pay and not providing me with a stub are both illegal. Thank you!43978.0270833333 Thank you for your quick response!When I go to file on the link provided, it asks how much my wages were ###. Since Iâ€™m not sure since I have no stub, should I just guesstimate what I think was ### or put ###?43978.1875 Yes thank you!!Stay well!43978.1923611111 You are very welcome, Ms. ###.  I would try to quantify your actual wages earned as accurately as possible.  Make some calculations on paper and double-check your math before you submit your complaint.  I believe you will be fine as long as you state the truth according to your best knowledge and ability, in good faith.  If there is a comment section anywhere, you can briefly explain why you might be off a little due to the employer's failure to provide you with accurate and timely records.  I hope this works!  Best wishes to you.43978.1895833333 You too.  Blessings.43978.1923611111 In ######, I was bitten on the face at work by a dog.

Blessings to you, again.43978.1958333333 Good evening, I hope this finds you well. I'll try to keep as brief as possible. I was ### from local company (deemed essential business during shut down) at end of March due to Coronavirus. I had attempted to use my PTO well before shutdown; followed the company policy in requesting my vacation. The Director of Operations (my immediate supervisor) failed to follow the company's policy and the request was ignored on his end.  We had an almost non-existent HR department (revolving door/ unqualified representatives situation). I was asked to adjust my request last minute because the owner was traveling out of town the same weekend. I was told I would be allowed to take it within ### (rollover from last year involved so deadline needed extending). Once government shut down started I attempted to directly request through email to my supervisor and several others in home office that I would like to use my PTO asap, as previously discussed. I attempted to get an answer on the request and was ignored several more times. Never received an answer from anyone the second time. We were unexpectedly ###  before anyone would address my request; however the owner stated herself we were not being fired and they would call us to return the second we could reopen our doors. I have yet to receive any additional communication regarding my employment status, although most of the other employees received a letter stating that their positions were terminated. I did not receive anything, even after confirming the correct address is on file in their employee self-service system. To get to my question: because they failed to follow their own policy with my first request and asked me to postpone at most, ###, and then proceeded to ### ignore my attempt to request a second time, is their any precedent for them to be required to pay out the time they refused to let me use? I understand the second time was right at beginning of pandemic. But the first request was due to their lack of following stated policy, then verbally agreed to make an exception so that I could use it, and then refused to communicate anything else regarding my situation. I received no communication until we were ###. I have not yet been able to directly communal with anyone in the organization which is very much still in operation. To be clear, the original employment agreement stated that they would not pay out unused time if I were to quit or be fired; it did not mention lay off situations at all. And i have not resigned, and they never formally terminated me. Nor did it mention instances in which they refuse to provide any kind of communication whatsoever after repeated requests for information. Also, does my employer have to provide me with copies of signed documents from my personal employee file if i request them? Or is that only if a court case is involved? Thank you for your help. 43979.0569444444 I was hired by a home health care company at an hourly rate of $9.###. The company charged clients $30. I have filed protective claims with both the IRS and NC dept of labor to ensure the employer is held responsible for their portion of federal and local taxes. Is it possible to seek lost wages and or the difference between what I was paid ($###) and what the employer fraudulently received ($###) in court? I worked for this person for ###. Literally, this person got rich off of my love and hard work taking care of elderly demented patients. I also have proof owner intentionally set up company to via s-corp to evade payroll taxes. I would appreciate any advice.Thank you!Cimdy43979.1284722222 This response is not legal advice and should not be the basis of any decision without actual and personalized guidance of an attorney engaged by you to do so.

The information provided in this response is based upon generic and ambiguous facts presented in a short question. The intricate facts of each case are different and important, and as a result it is important to receive individual and personalized legal advice and guidance prior to acting or refraining from acting.--Is it possible to seek lost wages and or the difference between what I was paid ($###) and what the employer fraudulently received ($###) in court?If the company hired you at $9.### $30.###, no, there is no loss of wages to you.  You received your wages of $9.###.  If the company did not pay you the $9.###, then you might have a claim for lost wages.  There is nothing wrong or illegal for the company hiring out your services for more than it pays you.  Nearly every company in the service industry does this ... law firms, doctor's offices, hospitals, and accountant offices are prime examples. It is unclear whether you are asking a question about the difference in the classification of an Independent Contractor vs. an Employee.  Generally, a business may pay an independent contractor and an employee for the same or similar work.  For employees, the company withholds income tax, Social Security, and Medicare from wages paid. For independent contractors, the company does not withhold taxes. Employment and labor laws also do not apply to independent contractors. The ### between classification is compliance, but one of the major differences is who has the right to control the activities of the person hired.  If the company ### complete control over the worker (what the worker does, how the worker performs the tasks assigned, etc.), the worker is an employee. That is contrasted with, a worker where the company issues the worker tasks and general guidance but does not control or dictate with specificity how to work is performed.  43990.9763888889 I recently got offered a job from ### and it was for an administrative assistant. I filled out an application, filled out reasoning as to why Iâ€™m a great candidate. I did an interview. I got hired on. Did the right hiring process. Filled out a W-4? Saved all documents that was sent to me. I worked at home. I just started this job. So all I needed was to download an app and text this person and pick up phone calls and what not. Then I was in training. First day they taught me about ### ###. They said businesses use this thing called ### because Regular transactions were too Slow and took forever to process? Well thatâ€™s why they decided to go with ###### which is basically ###. So they decided to train me how to input money in exchange for ###s. But Money was transferred from this one app into my personal bank account through my card with that app. And then I would cash out a certain amount and keep like at most $100. Then Iâ€™d have a barcode and what not. And I had to take pictures of the receipt on the screen and one sent to me. And send it back to the person training me for a confirmation of completion task of the day. Well, I still had ###. But now Iâ€™m not so sure. It seems fishy to me.... and I need advice. Iâ€™d be happy to send texts and documents. Plus the number they called me from is the same number from the legit website. So Iâ€™m just confused.43979.8972222222 I recommend you contact the North Carolina Attorney General's Office at ### or ###.   It concerns me that company funds were ### through your bank account; that is typical behavior for spammers.  You can also file a complaint online at https://ncdoj.gov/file-a-complaint/ but I suggest calling first to get advice and to alert the Attorney General to this company.  I would not recommend that you allow your bank account to be accessed any further.  Good luck.43990.8923611111 Because your hours were reduced due to no fault of your own (coronavirus) you may complete an unemployment application and they will calculate your base period and weekly allowance to determine if you are eligible for unemployment benefits based upon part-time employment. Basically, the base period is the 12-month period the unemployment office used to determine if you worked enough hours and earned sufficient wages during the base period to establish a claim for unemployment insurance benefits. An agent with the employment office will review your application to determine if you are eligible per their requirements. Below I have attached the link to apply for unemployment benefits with the NC Department of Commerce Employment Security office online:https://des.nc.gov/apply-unemploymentPlease let me know if you have any questions after reviewing their site or in completing your application and I'll be happy to help. 43987.7527777778 Hi Vanina, Your question requires a little more information. Big picture answer: Maybe. Can you let me know how many hours were you working before you dropped to ###? Also, what was the reason for your drop in hours?

When the covid crisis started our work went to about 5-###. Our company, under the claim of stepping up and doing the right thing told us not to file for partial unemployment that they were going to pay us for ###. Now that things are getting back to normal they have told us that it was a loan and we are in debt to the company. They are telling us we have to pay the money back and are taking the money out of our checks but not showing what we are actually earning with a deduction for the payment. There was no kind of agreement or communication that the money was a loan until the money was missing from the checks and there was no opportunity to opt out of receiving the money. The employment security commission says we canâ€™t file now because itâ€™s shown as earned income even though weâ€™re still going to be missing the same amount of money after repayment. Is this legal for them to do without telling us up front that it was a loan that would have to be payed back?  We feel like this was a deliberate act to keep us from filing partial unemployment claims while failing to disclose the fact the were going to reclaim the money. 43996.0861111111 Hi Sheng,I am sorry to hear about your recent employment struggles and that your job has been disrupted. Thank you for sending the detailed information with your questions.  In short, you should still be able to apply for and receive unemployment benefits.  The NC Department of Employment Security (â€œ###â€) currently allows an employee to receive benefits if her hours have been reduced due to COVID-###9.  Here are more details about potential next steps: The first thing to do would be to document your attempts to contact your employer, his failure to respond, and any communication you have with him.  Even if you do not have anything in writing, you should take detailed notes about when you called him and the details of the conversation. The purpose of unemployment is to provide you with compensation if you are unemployed or underemployed through no fault of your own. If you refuse to return to work, you may still be able to receive benefits if you do not return for good cause. However, in your situation, it seems as though you are not refusing to return to work but are more concerned about whether your boss will schedule you. Even if you have been recalled to work and you go into the restaurant, you are still able to continue to receive benefits if your hours have been reduced due to the pandemic. Whether you receive benefits, and the amount of benefits, is determined by ###. ### has a helpful Frequently Asked Questions page that you can find here: https://###.nc.gov/need-help/covid-###9-information/covid-###9-information-individuals#my-employer-has-called-me-back-to-work.-what-happens-if-i-choose-not-to-return Your situation is not fully explained on the ### webpage and I understand that it is more complicated because your employer has sent you a letter for work but has not scheduled you. The best thing for you to do in this situation is to document as much as you can. You can keep the letter that was sent, communicate with your boss primarily through email or messaging if possible and keep track of any other contact, have a witness if you speak in person, print out pictures of your schedule that he is not scheduling you on, and make it clear to your boss or other managers that you are asking to be scheduled. If your boss has asked you to return to work, but has not scheduled you at all, this could be considered constructive firing and the government does provide unemployment for that as well as the pandemic. If you are not refusing to work when your employer asks you to, you should not need to check the box of refusing employment. What you should do next is to:continue to file unemployment like you have,contact your employer once a week about trying to get on the schedule, making sure you document it,and I would suggest trying to find another job in the meantime. Even if your employer eventually begins to schedule you again, you may not want to be working for someone that has acted in the way you ###cribed in your question. Also, you should consider reaching out to an attorney that can go more in depth with you about how to work out this situation. From your message, it seems as though your boss may not be complying with employment laws and I am sorry to hear that you are afraid of his reaction. An attorney will be able to ask you more questions about your bossâ€™ behavior and determine the best way for you to move forward. Legal Aid of NC may be able to provide you with free or reduced cost services and they should also be able to refer you to another attorney if they are not able to help you.

I look forward to hearing back from you.44005.8506944444 Good evening, Mr. Clucas:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers, and for the detailed fact summary and supporting letter. In situations like yours, there are essentially two legal issues that might be in play--wrongful termination and defamation.  I see no case for the first, and only a ### case for the second.Assuming you are an at-will employee, you can be terminated in North Carolina at any time, for any reason, or for no reason stated at all.  There are of course some exceptions--such as illegal discrimination under federal law (i.e., based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability, or age if over 40), or violation of public policy under state or federal law.  I see none of that here, so unless there was a written contract in which you were protected from arbitrary or sudden termination, your termination as described here would be legal under North Carolina law.I am not totally sure about a potential defamation case with respect to your losing employment opportunities--presumably based on negative references that BB&T gave to hiring managers or other HR/personnel-related figures.  If BB&T provided negative information that they believe to have been, in good faith, reasonably grounded in facts that they were aware of during your employment, and they provided that information to prospective employers in the ### belief that the information was needed for prospective employers to make an informed decision about hiring you (or not), no legal action can be taken against BB&T, whether for defamation, malicious third-party interference with contract or prospective economic advantage, or anything else.  If, by contrast, BB&T's agents or officers knowing or recklessly made false statements about you, or made disparaging remarks as a means to hurt you rather than empower your prospective employers to make informed decisions about you, then you could have a viable claim against certain BB&T officials or agents for defamation.  The key thing would be proving the malicious intent, recklessness, or even negligence in making comments about your character that you believe are untrue.  Lastly, note that defamation requires concrete statements of fact; expressing a negative opinion of you, alone, does not mean that you can successfully pursue a defamation lawsuit.If you believe you have actual evidence of ill intent, I recommend your soon speaking with an employment lawyer to discuss this in greater detail.  Many such practitioners offer consultations in this area for free or at low cost, and this would at least give you a better idea of what if anything to do next.I hope you can soon find profitable and rewarding employment, so that you can continue making progress on your personal and professional goals.  Be safe, healthy and well during the present pandemic.44011.9236111111 Please see attached letter as well: I was notified that my employment with BB&T Corporation had ended on ###th, 20###7. I was never told an exact reason for this decision, although had made a personal banking mistake six months prior to being fired from what the investigator told me during a surprise interview in which I was unaware of until walking into the conference room back in May, 20###7.

As your post does not contain enough information, it is hard to provide you with an answer.44050.8972222222 ### -  While the EEOC process can typically be navigated without the assistance of a lawyer, filing an actual lawsuit for discrimination (which would be the next step) is much more complex.  While you would be free to represent yourself, in this type of suit your chances of success without a lawyer would be slim.  There are simply too many ### to the law and how it has to be presented.  There are plenty of lawyers who will take an employment discrimination case on a contingency basis, meaning that you don't pay their fees unless you recover something.  You would likely have to pay out of pocket for costs -- like the filing fee for the lawsuit -- but those costs would be minor in comparison to the fees.  You can Google employment discrimination attorneys, or call the North Carolina Bar Association's lawyer referral line:  800-###.  Good luck with your case.44029.4854166667 I am currently finalizing the investigative process with the EEOC and they are closing their findings. i was informed that they are pretty certain discrimination took place but,  due to the series of events, they'll more than likely rule it as a no finding" claim.  I have been advised to sue the company once I receive the Right To Sue Letter.  I'm confident I have a case as well as the intake officer but I have no legal knowledge and it hurts my argument.  What would be the best method to sue the company for damages retaliation and possibly PTSD?"44019.1659722222 I am a Tractor-Trailer Truck Driver.  I am currently unemployed seeking employment....I resigned from one Motor Carrier (last day worked ###) after accepting an employment offer from a different Motor Carrier.  On my second day of orientation with my new employer (###), I was told that they had to dismiss me because of information provided by the employer I had just left.  My previous employer reported to my new employer that I was involved in two preventable incidents/accidents while employed with them.  Together, these two incidents made me ineligible for hiring with my new employer.  Since the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)  Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) provides definitions to terms terms (390.5) such as; what is an accident/crash/incident, I expressed to my new employer that I was in one accident, not two.  I also spoke with my previous employer who was reporting the incorrect information and they refused to make any correction and said they had both the right/discretion and were required to report what they had reported.  Since the information being reported by my previous employer is not showing on any published records or reports, I was not been able to address it through the FMSA.Questions: Does a Motor Carrier have the right and authority to report an incident as an accident, when the incident does not meet standard definition(s) defined by the federal code?  (there were several terms that my previous employer used when talking with me, to affirm there ability to do what they did, that were misuses of parts of definitions used in the FCRs to support what was being told to me)Even if the previous employer is saying they are providing info as a reference, and I had consented for them to be contacted, reporting an incident as an accident in this industry implies certain things. Can they do that at there discretion?I was offered my job back without a reduction in pay but I do not wish to remain at that employer for various personal an professional reasons.  My lost wages would be part of the damages I wish to recover, will this effect damages that I can seek to recover?Thank You in advance for any insight that you are able to provide.Sincerely,Kevin Washington###44019.9743055556 I am so sorry this has happened.  Yes, trucking companies are required to report all incidents/accidents that are logged into their records.  In the event the previous employer failed to provide the new employer with this information, and you had an accident that injured someone in the future, both you and your current company would end up getting sued. In order to defend itself, your current company could sue your previous company for failing to provide information about your history of accidents so that they could decide whether or not to take the risk of hiring you.  I hope this information helps.44028.9430555556 ###,Sorry to hear this. You are owed any earned compensation under the NC Wage and Hour Act - ###.

Recently I've been in contact with friends who have tested positive for the virus, we had dinner on saturday and were within ### ###. They were already waiting for their COVID test results, and got a positive result on Monday. This is important as it plays into Spectrum's know before you go" COVID screening which is a daily set of questions that must be answered before we can begin work.

My test is scheduled for Monday ###.So I was exposed to someone who has tested positive and now I've been pulled from duty until ### for safety.  My question is this: my employer HR is now asking me to provide them with my friend's positive screening results.  Is that legal?  Can they ask me to knowingly break HIPAA laws by providing them with a non-employee's confidential medical information?  If so how do I appropriately get that information from my friend who is also under medical quarantine and ensure that it is safe and secure?  If not how do I let my employer know that I am unwilling to provide someone else's medical information?"44035.6527777778 No.  You can't be forced to provide your friend's medical information.  The friend may not even want to give it to you. However, if you had an exposure or you are awaiting test results, according to the ### you are supposed to quarantine.  You can call your doctor or even your local health department to report the exposure and a contact tracer may be assigned to you.  That contact tracer can provide you with a note to keep you out of work, as well. Honestly, though, if you are not exhibiting symptoms and your employer requires you to come back to work, it would be on them if you caused other people to get sick.  You could call North Carolina Department of Labor OSH Division and see what they recommend. If your test comes back negative though, you can return to work safely. To avoid potential problems, I would get your own doctor's note requiring you to stay out of work for ###. 44035.6958333333 That is also another requirement, the ###'s policy, not necessarily my Dr recommendation...  But I am sure my Dr will help me out in that regard.  I was just curious if they can legally force me to provide that medical information with threats of denial of benefits (my PTO for the time off) or even termination of employment.44035.6736111111 Good afternoon, Ohiniba:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  I am sorry to hear about what happened in both your marriage and your job situation.  Assuming that you are an at-will employee (which most ### employees are in North Carolina), there is nothing you can do legally about your termination.  In an at-will employee situation, an employer can terminate an employee at any time, for any reason, or for no reason stated, so long as it does not constitute illegal discrimination under federal law (i.e., based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability or age if over 40), or violation of public policy or other law (usually a statute or regulation).  If your husband's affair was the reason of your dismissal, that is very unfair, but still legal.  I wish I had better news to report.  I hope you can find a good suitable job very soon, and remain safe, healthy and financially stable during this pandemic.  Blessings and best wishes to you.44039.7229166667 I do not understand what you are saying.

As I indicated just now, I believe that is very unfair to you, but the law will uphold the employer's decision if you try to challenge it in court.  I wish that were not so, but it is.44039.7277777778 If I didn't file a discrimination lawsuit within the ###?44041.2111111111 Yes, it is too late.

What are my rights?44042.1541666667 Mr. Gentry:Thank you for your question.  You need to consult with an employment law attorney immediately, as it sounds like you might have a case for illegal retaliation.  It would require a thorough discussion of at least one hour to ascertain this for certain, since there are a number of details and facts that need to be confirmed before moving forward with a negotiation or lawsuit.  Many employment law attorneys will offer an initial consultation either for free or low cost, so I recommend searching online in your local area and seeing who you might be able to find.On ###, you can use the Find a Lawyer" feature and search under the practice areas of "Employment & Labor" and "Wrongful Termination."  I hope you can soon consult with counsel about this and see if anything further can be done.Blessings and best wishes to you during the present pandemic and I wish you good developments in finances and employment.

Four employees quit in less than a year.  Please note: there have only been five full-time employees with the company in the past two years.

He denied the request and said he had behaved this way for ### knew that others didnâ€™t like it (but it worked for him) and he did not plan to change. He has been disrespectful of race (including calling himself a "powerful white man" during the BLM protests) constantly referring to his wife and peers as "foreigners" or "the Albanian" and always making language barrier ###.  He would consistently speak ill about LGBT rights knowing I am an openly gay woman.  He treats women with more disrespect than he does men and speaks belittling to the women that work for him (including saying to me â€œdo you want to cry now?â€ during our last ###:###).  He mocks religion and insulted the religious practices of two former employees. After our last ###:### I was fearful of retaliation. I felt uncomfortable and unsafe with him as an employer.  I resigned with a ### notice which he did not allow me to complete.  Recently he requested reimbursement for the $######. It states in the contract I would be required to pay back the $###### I was let go during the COVID-###. I started ######9 â€“ I was asked to leave ######0.  Additionally the contract (attached here) stated I would receive an end-of-year bonus between $###500-$3### - which increased 40% while I was employed. I never received my bonus nor was it ever discussed because he did not conduct a year-end review (I did request this).I'm trying to better understand if this could be a case. I am fearful even now that he might come to my home demanding the money.  I am fearful for my reputation and unsure of what he might do to disparage me.

This is unpleasant indeed, given that it would be very easy for the company to just pay up and send you the commission, which is, as you say, very small.  You can send them a formal letter (mailed, and emailed as a PDF), warning them that you will take legal action if you do not receive payment in a certain time (###, ###, or whatever you desire).  If that communication is ignored, you would either have to retain a lawyer to demand payment for you, or sue the company in Small Claims Court (you could also contact NC Department of Labor to see if they would compel the company to pay, but I suspect they will not aggressively pursue it since they spend more of their enforcement time on protecting W-###, rather than ###).  Retaining counsel or suing in Small Claims Court would likely require as much money as the commission itself, so is not really desirable here.If the legal threat does not work, you may be out of desirable options to get the $###.  Be sure that you contact the highest person up the ladder as possible, and copy the HR official if you know who that is.I hope you can soon obtain your rightly deserved commission without undue hardship or expense.

North Carolina law does not require an employer by statute to pay out unused PTO hours; HOWEVER, if the employer agreed to do so as part of your employment contract, you would have a contractual right to PTO upon severance, which could be enforced against your employer in the event that the latter ### on the commitment.  That is the only way the employer would be required" to do so.  See the link below from NC Department of Labor that explains this more fully:###I hope this helps.  Best wishes to you during the present pandemic."44049.1215277778 ###,COVID based leave from the CARES Act and unemployment are two separate issues.  CARES Act leave provides:Two weeks (up to ###) of paid sick leave at the employeeâ€™s regular rate of pay where the employee is unable to work because the employee is quarantined (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), and/or experiencing COVID-###; orTwo weeks (up to ###) of paid sick leave at two-### the employeeâ€™s regular rate of pay because the employee is unable to work because of a bona fide need to care for an individual subject to quarantine (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), or to care for a child (under ###) whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the ### of the Treasury and Labor; andUp to an additional ###-### the employeeâ€™s regular rate of pay where an employee, who has been employed for at least ###, is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19.Based on the narrative you provided, you had not been diagnosed with COVID, and your mother was not diagnosed with COVID.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, the expanded family and medical leave only applies to instances where a child under the age of ###.  Based on your narrative, it does not appear that the protections of the CARES act apply to this particular situation.When you applied for unemployment, did you initially apply because the stores were closed or your work hours were reduced?  Once the same number of hours have been restored to you/there is work available, you are no longer considered unemployed.  If you applied because of closure of the business, and that business reopened, then unemployment would no longer apply.All of that being said, if you were provided another type of leave of absence pursuant to Office Max policies, you may have some recourse there.  If you happen to have a copy of Office and employee handbook, I am happy to review and see if you might have some recourse there. Thanks, ###44099.6944444444 Hello,I worked a retail position at Office Depot. in downtown High Point NC. I placed a leave of absence with my employer due to COVID-### 03/###. My mom (who I live with) has had cancer for ###, so her chemotherapy has crippled her immune system, leaving her susceptible to the virus. I had been receiving unemployment benefits to help feed my family that were supposed to last until the end of July.On ###th, my unemployment income stopped, and I couldn't figure out why. It took me hours of phone calls with NC unemployment over the course of almost ### (thinking there was an error with my unemployment since even the unemployment agents couldn't figure out the issue) just to figure out that my manager has marked me as Able to Return to Work" without ever telling me. This shut off my unemployment benefits. To this day I have still not received a single phone call email mail or text notification of any of this from my manager or anyone. When I called HR on 08/03 I found out that my leave of absence has been cancelled completely without anyone telling me. He also has never offered me hours to work since my leave began.Now the state owes me around $### I havenâ€™t been able to buy food for my family for ### and my HR case could last over a month before they decide to process the results. This doesnâ€™t even count the web of problems I will have to hammer out with the unemployment office. I can't wait another month to buy food for my family.Is this illegal activity? Do I have any legal standing in this? Thanks###"44049.5381944444 ###:Can you upload the document?To the extent the document seeks your waiver of coronavirus-related issues, it is likely invalid for several reasons, including the fact that an employee legally cannot waive their protections under OSHA or the worker's compensation statute.  An employee may be able to waive certain claims, like negligence claims, but more is likely required.As for claims under the FLSA or NC Wage and Hour Act (regarding your unpaid overtime), an employee also cannot waive such protections.  I'm not sure whether your employer is asking that you waive all of your employment rights (including an unpaid overtime claim) by signing that contract, or only your rights as they relate to the coronavirus, but either way, your overtime claim should remain intact (unless you sign a valid settlement agreement or something of that nature, but it doesn't sound like that's the issue here).Without seeing the document, my initial thought is that your signing the document will likely have no legal effect, but there is always a small degree of risk in doing so.  The law does protect you from retaliation, however.  If you refuse to sign the contract and tell your boss that you're doing so because you believe it would violate your rights under the worker's compensation statute, under the FLSA, and under the NC Wage and Hour Act, and if he fires you in retaliation for doing so, you will likely have a valid retaliation claim against your employer (in addition to your unpaid wages claim).  If you choose to go that route, I would put your refusal and reasoning in writing, as it would provide much greater evidentiary value if you need to go to court than a simple he said she said" situation.After you upload the document we can discuss further but either way if you're comfortable filing an action against your employer upon your receipt of enough hours to receive licensure you likely have a viable lawsuit on your hands.Best###"44058.4868055556 ###:Make sure you save all of those text messages, and any other evidence you may have (emails, memos, etc.).  I would recommend saving them somewhere safe, like a cloud-based program, in case anything happens to your phone.Not paying you for lunch breaks that you do not actually take (or, even if you do take them, lunch breaks that are sufficiently interrupted with work) is certainly unlawful.  If he is lying about bonuses that he pays to you in your paystubs, that could pose an issue for him with the IRS, too.Most attorneys taking these types of cases will do so on a contingency fee basis, where you only pay a percentage of what you recover, if applicable, and nothing upfront.  I would be happy to write a demand letter on your behalf, pro bono.  First, I would need to see all of your evidence to verify everything.  If your boss is not responsive to a demand letter and significant negotiations or a mediation is needed, or if a lawsuit needs to be filed (or if you'd simply like to skip the demand letter process and jump right into a lawsuit), I may be able to represent you on a contingency fee basis, but we can discuss that, or your retention of another attorney, if it comes to that.Note that retaliation against an employee complaining about unpaid wages is unlawful.  As such, if we send a demand letter or file a lawsuit and your boss treats you badly, suspends you, ### you, or fires you as a result, that may give rise to an additional claim (and additional damages) against your boss.  The prospect of an additional claim, however, may not necessarily cause your boss to think twice before taking such an action against you -- he may choose to do so anyway.  Accordingly, I always advise my clients to consider the fact that they may face consequences for taking action, and make sure they are prepared to be unemployed for some time, if their employers take adverse action.  It rarely happens, but it does happen occasionally, and it sounds like your boss in particular may be especially unscrupulous.  I would just make sure you're ready for the worst before we dive in.  Lawsuits can also take years to resolve, so even if you are ultimately successful, it may be some time before you see any recovery.Let me know what you're thinking in terms of next actions and we can go from there.  If you want to move forward with a demand letter, please send your evidence to me (if you can't send it all on this website, my email address is ###).  If you want to skip a demand letter and move forward with filing a lawsuit, we should discuss that arrangement further first, so please provide your phone number and email address and I'll follow up with you.  If you want to sit and wait before doing anything, either to secure another job or for some other reason, feel free to contact me when you are ready to move forward.

Feel free to email me the evidence when it's compiled.  I have children too and completely understand any delay.  Since you started in ######, you shouldn't lose any damages as long as we file suit by ###21, assuming we are successful in showing wilfulness.As for your questions, recordings are generally admissible if authentic, and if we did file a lawsuit, we would be able to compel his records.One question I do have to ask, however, is do you think your boss will be able to afford a judgment of tens of thousands of dollars?  Unfortunately, insurance does not cover these types of disputes, so there's always a risk when going after small businesses that they simply don't have the money they owe, or they'll declare bankruptcy if a judgment is entered against them, or something along those lines.  It's a sad reality that even if you were undoubtedly deprived of the wages owed to you, your ability to recover what is rightfully yours will turn on whether your employer actually has the money.  When you deal with the stubborn/vindictive type too, sometimes they'd rather tank their business, hide/deplete their assets, and/or declare bankruptcy than pay up.  It wouldn't be the first time I saw an unscrupulous business owner go to extreme ends to try to avoid paying out a judgment.Best,###44062.0138888889 ###:Yes, that document has no legal effect.  Coercing you like that will invalidate it, even though it was probably already invalid on its face. You should be sure to save the text message that your boss sent you about it, too, as it could be valuable evidence down the line.  Documenting as much as possible is good on your side, but under the law, it is the employer's responsibility to document hours worked, wages earned, etc.  Your evidence that he has been changing your hours will certainly help to demonstrate that he is not reliable on the issue, and that the court should defer to any reasonable and grounded explanation that you provide.  An estimation of unpaid wages is admissible in these types of situations, as long as they have a factual basis.How long have you been working there?  Note that the statute of limitations is two years by default (three if you can show willfulness, which may be the case here), so if you filed today, you would be limited to recovering wages accrued since ###### (or ###).  If you file in a year, the period of recovery moves accordingly (limited to ###19/20###).Also, how many other employees does Volt employ, and how many do you think experienced similar issues?  That could help for leverage.Best,###44060.3895833333 Background: My boss does not follow labor laws. I have documented him changing my 'hours worked' on my ###, paying me less than I'm owed.

My boss texted me last Thursday morning to say that he would not pay me until I signed the contract, so because the next day was payday, I did. I literally can not miss a check.

Based on the facts you described here, I would say that your husband would not be successful in suing his employer.  If your husband is instructed by his employer to take reasonable precautions in light of Covid-19, and is provided a reasonable degree of ### and other resources that would allow him to do his regular job without unreasonable exposure to the virus, it would be lawful for the employer to require performance of normal work duties even if there is some discomfort by the employee.

It looks like you submitted the question in September, and I am not sure if you have already had your inquiry answered.Typically, the job protection law that applies when a person takes maternity leave is the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA).    I am sorry to say that the Family Medical Leave Act applies to private employers who have at least ###.  If your employer only has seven employees, the employer is not required to comply with FMLA, and that means you are not entitled to job protections for leave.  Have you discussed trying to use any sick or vacation leave to cobble together the time off that you need?  If you want to keep the job, it may be worth trying to negotiate leave with your employer.  Unfortunately, the employer does not have to give you this leave due to the size.  When the law was written, it probably took into account the difficulty small employers could have with complying.

However, it will likely be easier for everyone to follow what is important to you and your case if you greatly condense your evidence into a short brief.  Not all evidence is relevant, and so, it may be useful for you to pick out the most important parts you want to convey.It was kind of the Director to consider reopening the case.  If the EEOC issues another Right to Sue letter or if it does not reopen your case, your only recourse is to file a lawsuit in federal court in the Western District of NC within ###.  If you opt to do this, I suggest greatly condensing and editing what you wish to present so that everyone can follow the points that are most important to you.  If you file a suit in federal court, you will want the judge to focus on your main points.Good luck! 44121.0729166667 I have filed ###, both received a Right to Sue" with a No Determination of cause issued. My case is rather large with a local powerful connected influential rich entity and therefore I have a lot of evidence. The Director has offered an opportunity to defend my request to reopen my case.

When I look through my evidence video's recording's that is too big to email btw or upload into the portal (Not Their Fault!)

I was then informed by the supervisor on duty that I had to write a statement, then he had to send me home for the day. HR would contact me the following day.

If you are a member of a union, look at the collective bargaining agreement.  If you are not a member of a union, look at your offer letter or employment agreement (if you have one). Also, look at your employee handbook and see what it says about payment of PTO when employment ends.44139.8902777778 I am sorry to hear this. On one hand, Door Dash business model is based on a balance between driver's security and customer's security. Folks dont want to open their doors to complete strangers bearing gifts, or in this case, food they paid for already. Thus, the policy requiring that your full name or other information is disclosed.  there may be a better solution, but you cant make a legal claim that they have a second-rate system. HOWEVER, if they recovered , through their recovery contractor, the money that should have gone into your account, they should be willing to make you whole, less their cost to recover the money. I expect that they pay a percentage to Stripe, and you would have similar cost in trying to recover as well. So stay after them to re-deposit in your account, but be prepared for them to take their recovery cost off the top. You cant sue Stripe, directly, in small claims court or otherwise because they have no contract with you and no duty to you. Your beef is with Door  Dash.

If you were not performing to standards at your job, it would be cause for termination of employment, even if you have a disability.  However, the EEOC can help if you were fired not for misconduct, but due to your disability.  You can find the local office and file an intake questionnaire at eeoc.gov.  44112.5597222222 Dear Ms. ###: I am very sorry to hear what you experienced in your workplace. That type of conduct is unacceptable, and it is illegal. Based on what you said about the sexual harassment, I suggest you consider filing a claim at the EEOC as soon as possible.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission office that reviews claims from ### County is in Greensboro.  I will paste the contact information below.  The EEOC will investigate your claim and make a conclusion about whether there is a basis to hold the employer accountable for a hostile work environment or any Title VII protections.  You will need to know the date of the last time you were sexually harassed, but be sure to say that it has been ongoing for over three years.  Include any text messages you have as evidence in your Charging documents if the portal allows it. As to what your supervisor said about slitting your throat, I am sorry this person said this awful thing to you.  If you actually feel threated by the statement, you can report it to the police. Be sure to say you have a text and voicemail.  You could also pursue a restraining order against this person known as a 50C No Contact Order.  If you have ever been in a relationship with that person, you could instead file for a domestic violence protective order or a 50 (b). I am glad to hear you did not finish your notice.

I highly recommend that you explain to HR or your manager what happened so there is a record.  Make it clear that nothing the employee did at the time of the injury made you think it was big deal or a reportable accident.  If it is a compensable claim, it will be on the company to pay the expense, if there are any.  It will not fall on you financially.

Any guidance regarding my potential eligibility would be much appreciated.### MacPherson44123.8791666667 There are four criteria that you must meet to be eligible for unemployment benefits in North Carolina: (###) You must be unemployed due to no fault of your own (NC Division of Employment Security will make this determination based upon information provided by you and your last employer); (###) You must be considered monetarily eligible (earned sufficient wages to establish a claim); (###) You must be physically able, available and actively seeking work; and (###) You must register for work with your resident state's job service office.It looks like you are still employed by your employer, which makes it difficult to meet the first criteria above.  If you are laid off work temporarily or if your hours are reduced due to a business slowdown or a lack of demand as a result of COVID-###9, then you may be able to receive unemployment benefits. In order to determine eligibility, you must first apply for unemployment. You can apply for unemployment by visiting https://des.nc.gov/apply-unemployment. If you're temporarily out of work or working reduced hours due to COVID-###9, select one of those two separation reasons when filing your claim. If, however, youâ€™re working reduced hours due to reasons not related to COVID-###9, then you may not be eligible for unemployment compensation. I recommend that you contact the NC Division of Employment Security to discuss your eligibility questions in more detail. The customer call centerâ€™s number is ###-###.44147.875 Contact your local Legal Aid of North Carolina office - they provide free representation in most unemployment cases.44133.0875 Is this fair that they waited so long to let me know about this?

You are legally permitted to secretly record any conversation--including one with a supervisor or boss--AS LONG AS you are a party to the conversation.

Everything I am about to explain was either observed or made aware of to the manager of that specific store, ###. There is a big hole located in the back storage room, which poured rain into the storage room during heavy rains. Also, the water ran into the former kitchen area (now used as an office/cleaning supply area) causing mold to grow in the bottom border of the wall itself. Became even worse after Hurricane ###. In ###20, the bathrooms were shut down due to a busted pipe, customers relieved themselves behind the building and employees were also expected to do it as well (yes, I had NO choice as the store could not be shut down for any reason other then robbery or risk termination). As the ### mandate began in N.C., the manager ### refused to follow said order. Other smaller but still important instances were when the power went out, ### sandwiches, milk, cheese, and other ### products were left out by same manager or sometimes placed in another freezer located in the office/cleaning supply area which rarely actually worked.

As far as a case I am not sure that you can get any monetary compensation for what was happening.  Although you may want to seek out an attorney who will talk to you regarding whether a demand letter would be helpful in providing some severance option for you.  44151.8583333333 Employers are not required to pay out unpaid vacation and/or sick time. It is dependent on your employer's policy/handbook. Nor are employers required to pay severances. I would suggest that you file for unemployment, if you have not already, and hopefully you will be called back to work. NC, like many other states, is an at will employment state, meaning that employees can be let got for any reason (unless it is discriminatory, i.e. based on race, gender, etc). Thus, they are not required to rehire employees either.44166.9652777778 You may also want to contact the ND Department of Wage, Claim and Labor if you think you should have been paid out.44166.9673611111 i will like to know what law prevent my employer for paying me my earned income for ###. my human resources told me that they are not understanding the law.

My place of work is in Carrboro in Orange County, North Carolina. I currently have no pending case or legal action. Contact with the Federal and NC DOL have so far been circuitous and frustrating. My employment was terminated ### this year related to the imminent closure of all dine-in service in the state but I returned to work ###. Effective upon my return, my employer, Acme Food & Beverage, had changed the pay structure of hourly employees to ### involve a full-house tip pool. Previously a front-of-house only tip pool existed.Now all hourly employees are guaranteed" $### by our employer to obtain Orange County Living Wage Certification but this requires little material risk by them. This is because as I have learned by discussing with our accountant in practice what is done is that all employees in question are paid $### wage by the restaurant to avoid violation of the Federal FLSA then the net tips turned in to the restaurant (a very large portion of which are received by me personally as the sole full-time server though a significant portion is also received through take-out orders) are redistributed among the hourly employees that are employed during dinner service. This is done in two steps first to bring all these employees from the $### wage paid to $### to obtain "living wage" certification (at this point the restaurant would in principle pay any deficit found there but I am unaware of this having occurred and if it were to that deficit would be slight) then any remaining tips turned in are distributed in proportion to hours worked over the pay period (two weeks) to the members of the pool to raise the hourly wage of all equally (this has never exceeded 3$/hr).I understand this change of policy to be in violation of NC GS 95-25.3(f) as it both establishes a tip pool for those who do not customarily receive tips and my tips are reduced by a great deal more than 15% (considering a $### ### they have been reduced by around 60%-75% each period). By the most charitable comparison to a situation where I am paid the minimum wage that is legal with tip credit $2.13/hr and the tip pool is assumed to be legal so that I only have legal claim to 85% of my tips received I have lost more than $### "guaranteeing living wage" to all employees. This has caused directly caused me financial difficulty and I seek to compel an end to this ### practice and hopefully the return of some of my legally owed tips.I have made records and calculations of my tips and pay available at http://tipsheet.tallyl.net but I have also attached a PDF of its current contents.Thank youTally ###"44151.8534722222 This response is not legal advice and should not be the basis of any decision without actual and personalized guidance of an attorney engaged by you to do so.

One manager, ###, a married man in his ###, transferred from another store less than six months ago in order to cover for our long ### manager going on maternity leave. She's back from maternity leave and he's still here until another position opens up for him. He's upset many team members with his abrasive and ineffectual management style and we've been looking forward to his eventual transfer. On Friday a former employee made a public Facebook post detailing his alarming sexual harassment and the mismanagement of it by hr and upper store managers. She and another still current employee, both young girls under 21, made separate cases with hr. He would show up at work well after his shift ended to make conversation, bring them food and gifts, blatantly ogle them, messaging them on Facebook, and told one that he bet she was a freak in bed. My team has witnessed him behave like this towards a ###. She's married with a baby. He'll frequently stare at her and sidle up to her to show her videos on his phone, joke around and flirt with her. She tries to ignore it and act like its not happening. We found out that he was transferred to our store because of this same behavior. I'm an older female who significantly taller than him and on the spectrum, so I don't read social ### as well and don't have any strong incidents personally, but have frequently had to redirect and laugh off multiple unprofessionally friendly conversations, including one this past week where he seemed obsessed withrepeatedly telling me that a customer found me super cute." The whole store knows that he hasn't been disciplined and I don't know what happens next or what I can do. I absolutely do not want to continue working for him and do not want him having input on my job performance. Most of my team feels the same way. Can we make a collective complaint to hr? If we composed a letter and had enough employees sign it could we get him fired? Can we complain to hr on behalf of the team member with the strongest case? Can we collectively strike or walk out if this continues to be mishandled? My goal here is for him to be removed from the store as quickly as possible without anyone else quitting their job or getting fired. So far two people have quit because of this and its being used as an excuse to ignore the situation. Our regional manager refuses to read the Facebook post saying that since she's no longer an employee its no longer a concern. HR dropped both cases because there were no witnesses and no physical contact. They also allowed him to retaliate and claim that the girl who quit was sleeping with .multiple store employees (she wasn't).

He can deduct for ### or theft, but can't withhold the full paycheck. 44168.8708333333 Hi Ociane,Thank you for your commitment to the animals. Iâ€™m so sorry your employment at Reverence ### did not end the way you had intended. I can see that you were very concerned about the needs of your employer and that they would not be short-staffed after you left. North Carolina is a right to work state. We donâ€™t have unions. You are free to work for whomever you choose and leave when you want to. You can be ###inated for no reason or any reason so long as the reason is not based entirely on illegal discrimination (age, ethnicity, gender, family status, disability).    If you have an employment contract that guarantees employment for a period of time and you are then fired before the end of the ###, you would likely have recourse in the form of liquidated damages as a part of the contract. You did not mention that you had an employment contract, and I wouldnâ€™t expect you to have one. You would think that if you gave your employer notice (two weeks is customary) that the employer would be obliged to accept it and allow you to work through the notice period. They are not. This is essentially what has happened to you. They did not ###inate your employment, they accepted your notice. I read your letter. Your intent was to tell them that you had concluded that the job was not working out for you and at some point in the future you were going to give them proper notice. However, they have interpreted your letter to mean that you were in fact giving notice. This is a fair interpretation, but not what you intended to convey. You donâ€™t mention the nature of your disability, but I wanted to mention it in case you were wondering if it would have an impact. Even if were a protected disability, it is unlikely that you would be able to allege unlawful ###ination (and recover damages) for the very fact that you told the employer you had decided to leave the employment. You are entitled to any unused vacation/PTO days that are credited to you. Be sure to confirm you have been paid for these. Review the employee handbook for specifics. Severance is at the discretion of the employer and not required. It's common to see severance during lay-offs or when an employer is incentivizing employees to resign.  I realize I have painted a very grim picture and what happened to you doesnâ€™t seem fair. It is clear to me that you were trying to work with them. I wish I could say that what happened to you is uncommon. It is not. If you are on good ###s with your employer, you can try to work with them to get what you need going forward, such as a recommendation/reference. Some time has passed since you left. Would you be willing to work for them again if the situation were improved? Is it worth contacting them to see if they need help?~###44177.9479166667 I moved from ### to ###, NC to work for Reverence ###. As previously agreed with my employed, my job was suppose to consist of: Ordering feed and supplies and ### feed, conducting weekly all-staff team huddles in coordination with farm manager; drafting and helping implement SOPâ€™s, with input of farm management team; ensuring animals are being cared for daily, including water, feed and management and performing general maintenance and upkeep of buildings, grounds and equipment; working with team to ensure ### and sanitation in the work area; drafting staff training program, staff manual with input of farm management team; assists farm manager in managing employees, in ### performance evaluations and serving as acting farm manager on farm managerâ€™s days off; assisting with electronic and written record keeping. Salary offered was $42,### 40-###, depending on season, ###.During my time at Reverence, the tasks that I was asked to do were almost all field work and farm work. I worked on average ###, in the field. At most, I did a couple hours of record keeping each week. Even though I was considered an exempt employee and payed bi-monthly, my employer did not let me take part in administrative tasks.On ### in the morning, I sent an email to my manager ### Tafel to give her details about my health and current status at work. My courtesy letter described the overwhelming working conditions I was submitted to, my current health conditions, and mentioned that I would be looking for another job. I explained that I would keep them posted on my job search and give them an appropriate notice so that they could find a replacement.I was fired mid-day, immediately after my manager ### Tafel sent my letter to the owner, ### ###.

I was told that they were not going to allow me to work at the new steakhouse, because they would not be willing to take servers away from the old company to be at the new one. Are they legally allowed to do this to me? I was really looking forward to moving up in the world. (At least as a server) This was a major blow up in my face. Please help me. 44171.2006944444 Good evening, ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  Unfortunately, there is no legal requirement that the owners of the two businesses allow your lateral entry from one company to the next one; there is also no legal requirement that they promote you to other, higher positions within either company, even if you have very good reason to believe that you deserve promotions, raises, bonuses, and/or other benefits as a reward for your hard work in the first business.  I can understand how you, like anyone else with self respect, would desire that your efforts be rewarded with greater benefits, but it is legal for the employer to deny you such ### ###, even if it is unfair from your point of view.I ### with how you feel, but note that there is no legal implication here based on the facts that you related in your post.  I wish I could offer a more encouraging answer.An employee in your situation must weigh whether remaining at the business (especially if you have a guaranteed job for now at a time when others do not have jobs) is worth your getting a steady paycheck, versus your leaving and trying to find alternative employment, where you believe your contributions are going to be better appreciated.  Best wishes to you this ensuring pandemic winter.44171.9708333333 It is a family owned business if that helps at all. I just feel stuck with this company.

It is difficult to offer you a precise, definite answer to your question, since the question of whether to put a case before a jury (in state or federal court, civil or criminal) is really a matter of trial strategy on the part of the lawyer, who might take different tacks based on the case at any given time.Sometimes a lawyer will refuse settlement and proceed to trial if s/he believes that the highest settlement offer made is simply too low to accept for the client's best interests.  Juries are often unpredictable, but when a lawyer opts to proceed before one, that is usually a sign that s/he has a high degree of confidence that a good result will occur.Other than this, one would have to ask the lawyer in question as to what his/her rationale is in utilizing a jury trial.  This differs from lawyer to lawyer.Best wishes to you during this pandemic winter.  Stay safe, healthy, and ###.44173.1902777778 why would someone want a case heard by a jury in federal employment discrimination case?44172.8319444444 I live in New ### County. I have a hearing this Thirsday with the Department of Employment Security about an appeal my previous employer filed about my uninsurance claim I filed back in ###. I'm confused about what is happening. According to what I got from ###, i was not disqualified for benefits. Then, I got this notice for a hearing, which seems to contradict what I've been told previously by ### (the determination letter).  In ###, i was sent home from work, due to my coughing, and my boss wanting me to get a COVID test. I complied, and quarantined the necessary ###. Previous to this, i had requested assistance at work with scheduling, as my mother is older and lives by herself, as do i, and if i got sick, I would be unable to help her. I was able to extend my leave through the end of the month. When I returned to work, i started sneezing and coughing, resulting in my being send home again, and my boss requiring another COVID test. They wanted me to come back to work before the quarantine was over, and when I said I was still quarantining,  they said I was voluntarily resigning. I responded that I was not voluntarily resigning,  but that it sounded to me as though if I didn't come in, that they were choosing to let me go.A month after that, I filed for unemployment, having gone through what money I had in my bank account to pay my bills and mortgage,  and to apply for the stimulus check.I have been applying and ### for jobs since then, and filing my weekly certification to that effect. I heard nothing about any issue, until recently, when I got the notification for the hearing.I'm very confused by the legal language in the paperwork, and need someone to help me understand what is happening.I can submit the documents from ###, if that would help.44172.8708333333 This response is not legal advice and should not be the basis of any decision without actual and personalized guidance of an attorney engaged by you to do so.

That decision by ### was sent to both you and your former employer.  It looks like after your former employer received that notice, your employer filed an appeal with ###.  As a result a hearing appears to be scheduled to determine (###) if you left work without good cause that is attributable to your employer, (###) whether you were discharged for misconduct connected to work, and (###) whether you are unemployed within the meaning of the law (so as to receive benefits).  So, it looks like there is now a hearing to decide whether you get to keep receiving unemployment benefits.44175.9909722222 Good evening, Mr. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  While your fact summary does not appear to indicate wrongful termination or racial or sexual orientation (at least not that can be maintained in a court of law), you might want to consult at least once with an experienced employment law attorney, who can ask you questions and elicit more details and ### about the differences between your treatment and that of others from different groups (white women for example, or heterosexuals), which this website is not set up to facilitate.  While I acknowledge that I do not know this situation as well as you do, if I were basing my answer only on what you wrote here, I would say that while you have an ### or intuition (correctly or incorrectly) that you were treated harshly because of your race and/or sexual orientation, the at-will employee rule will most likely prevail in favor of the employer, absent hard proof of particularly egregious conduct by the employer that constitutes illegal discrimination (i.e., based on race, sex, sexual orientation, color, national origin, religion, disability or age if over 40), or some other violation of law or public policy.Nonetheless, given that you have a ### job on the line here, I recommend that you find a good employment law attorney and request a ### consultation (some offer free consults, and others do not, but even if not, it is worth paying a fee for in order to have a thorough vetting discussion of key facts).  Once you have consulted with employment law counsel, you will at least have the peace of mind, regardless of the outcome as to the attorney's conclusion, that you did right by yourself in doing whatever you needed to get the best information about your rights.Among your available resources is ### Find a Lawyer" feature (search by NC city/town under "Wrongful Employment" and "Employment & Labor" practice area categories) and the referral sources of both the Wake County Bar and the North Carolina Bar Association (call them and ask for lawyer referral service if interested).While this is not necessarily a complete or satisfactory answer to your worthwhile question I hope it at least gives you a start and gives you a sense of what would need to be proven should you decide to sue your former employer.Blessings and best wishes to you and your family this winter."44183.10625 I am aware that NC is a right to work state but I was fired from my job of ###. I felt that the firing was unjust and biased due the fact there was managers who did not want me to be there and wanted to bully and harassment. The firing all happen within the same week that I got a step ###. I called HR and spoke with the District Manager at the time and she asked why I did not call the store manager at the time and I told her how I could not reach someone over the phone and did not have the store manager phone number who was also on vacation at the time. I did spoke with an assiocate to let them know that I had made the schedule and sent it to her email. They did not investigate my claims and I felt very much discriminated against because I am a gay black young in a position normally held by women. The same company I worked for allowed another manager same position as me who assaulted a pregnant co-worker and was able to keep her job but same policy states that that person should be terminated as well. Also another manager harass multiple women sexually and verbally and still able to keep his job. I would like to know if I have a case or not I feel like I do and I have multiple eye witnesses and accounts.44182.7243055556 Good Morning,I appreciate your response.The contract actually doesn't say much, except for the ###, compensation and benefits, and job responsibilities- see attachment.However, I have also included the ###ination policy section of the personnel manual, which clearly outlines the grounds for immediate ###ination and the required steps of the ###ination process. All staff and managers must sign and agree to this process, and it was not followed in my case.There were no grounds for immediate ###ination according to the policy, and the required steps for warnings and signed documentation were not taken.Would the contract and policy take precedence over the at-will status?Thank you,44183.7034722222 Good evening, Ms. ###:Thank you for posting on NC Free Legal Answers.  This is a very good question, and the precise answer depends on the exact language of the contract.  If your written contract states that you cannot be removed except for cause I agree that you cannot simply be terminated for no reason or warning, at least during the one year in question.  For purposes of the one year, in that instance, you would not be an at-will employee, although you would become one after the one year expires, if you remain with the employer and a new contract with tenure guarantees is not signed for a new period.All of this comes down to what precise grounds the employer could still invoke during the one year protection, and whether your behavior, conduct or performance triggered the reserved grounds that your employer could still invoke under the written contract.  It is on this upon which the legality or illegality of your employer's actions hinges.What does your contract say about termination during the one year?Thanks and be well.44183.1145833333 I appreciate your time Mr. ###. I will contact Ms. Richberg.Best regards,44183.7423611111 I was terminated from my job without warning, while under a one year contract, in violation of company policy. Is employment at-will when there is an employment contract?44183.0895833333 Ms. ###:Thanks for the follow up.  As I indicated in my first message, you do not become an at-will employee until the year is over, assuming the contract guarantees you a set ### of employment.  Your contract strongly suggests that, but does not say that explicitly, so I would say that the contract and policy have to be read together to fully understand what your status and rights are, as you appear to appreciate already from having sent me both documents.If you did not violate any of the conditions set forth on pages ### ###, I would say that you have a strong ground for breach of contract.  You might consider retaining a lawyer to send a letter of warning to the employer, demanding either reinstatement for the remainder of your one year as outlined in the contract, or payment to a certain sum in order to avoid legal action in court.  If your employer gets a threatening letter from a lawyer who agrees that your contractual rights were violated, such a letter might be enough to restore you substantially, even if it is not a perfect fix.There are many good employment lawyers in and around ### who could help you with this.  Try going to ### and using the Find a Lawyer" feature searching under "Employment & Labor."  You can narrow search results by NC town/city.  ### County alone is full of small firms and solo practices with employment law matters.  You might specifically consider looking at Shalya Richberg my colleague on the board of directors of the ### County Bar Association.  See her page below:http://www.richberglaw.com/If you reach out to Shayla about a consultation let her know that her ### colleague ### ### strongly recommended you to her.  I believe Shayla can be a firm and highly competent counselor and protector of your interests.I sincerely hope this goes well Ms. ### as it appears to me that you were treated unfairly in this situation."44183.7208333333 You are so welcome, and God bless you.

I live in ###, NC. I work full time with the Public School system. I am a ###. I work part time for the City of ### nights and weekends throughout the school year.

We worked virtually with the school system until June12th. My part time job paid us a base salary until ###th. City of ### sent us a letter telling us we could apply for unemployment benefits. I did as instructed and I called and had a ### agent assist me with filing my claim. I explained to them from day one that I was not applying for benefits against Wake county Public Schools but against City of ### (my part time job). My son who also works for City of ### and I applied on the same day and he started receiving his benefits the next week. When my benefits didn't come after a week or two I started calling. I received different answers as to why my benefits had not arrived. Eventually I received notice my claim was denied. I appealed. I had my hearing on ###th. After explaining that my claim was never against Wake County Public schools and that I did not apply for benefits during a time I was getting paid from Wake county and that my part time income was very necessary to my financial survival I received notice on the 18th that my claim was still denied. I was asked by the appeals referee if I had applied for pandemic unemployment. I guess I assumed that when I indicated that my job closed due to  Covid-###. I only needed assistance for the job that I would have worked all summer but because of Covid those hours were unavailable. Once school resumed in late August I did not file for benefits any more. I am really not understanding why I was denied since I proved I missed out on income because of Covid 19. As a matter of fact my part time job has still not reopened. I have a coworker at school who also works for City of ### whose benefits were first denied but after calling in ###. I don't know why the adjudicator could not see that my claim was wrong and offer assistance to correct it and get me the back pay I feel I was entitled to. I have ###.

While not clear from your post, it sounds like a contract may have never been entered into - if the employee wanted a ### that the company did not want or accept, it does not sound like there was a contract ever entered. A contract gener###ly requires both the employee and company to agree on ###l ###s.44188.1520833333 I live near Hickory, NC and do not have a pending case. Iâ€™ve been sent home after refusing to wear a ### when stuck in the warehouse. I have a class B CDL and typically drive. In the warehouse several employees work very close and wear their ### below their nose or below their chin. I simply donâ€™t feel comfortable or protected with one. Iâ€™ve volunteered as an EMT and firefighter and am aware of the risk and protocols during a â€œpandemicâ€. Even with clear visibility from his office, my boss has seen other with a ### pointlessly hanging from others ### and say nothing. Yet when I simply say Iâ€™m uncomfortable with it and canâ€™t wear one. I was threatened with discipline and or termination. The first time I was sent home over this, my boss was literally nose to nose screaming about me needing to have a ### on with witnesses present. Iâ€™m the only person whoâ€™s been sent home over this. I was informed by HR that if others ###s were down (rendering the ### useless), it was ok if they put it up when asked, but being uncomfortable with one and not willing to put one on was insubordination of the policy that everyone is supposed to be accountable for. There was a rash of COVID at this plant a month or so ago even with ###s being mandatory. Either people werenâ€™t wearing their ### or ### doesnâ€™t work. When everything came about with COVID, I stayed home for a few weeks just to be precautionary, we knew nothing about it. After learning more about the spread of it, I went back to work after learning more. I wasnâ€™t the only to take time off but thatâ€™s being held over my head and I feel discriminated against and embarrassed being treated this way. Do I have a case and if so, how can I get past a consultation fee given my money situation. My wife is also disabled due to Touretteâ€™s. May will ### ###â€™ve been at this company. 44194.7104166667 I was under a ### â€˜###, but none since. Iâ€™m not a part of a union either. Iâ€™m not sure if the home office in Pa is union or not, or if it would even apply to me. Iâ€™m the only person who has been sent home over not wearing a ###. I have pics of employees and non employees inside the plant without a ### on but Iâ€™ve been sent home ###. It seems wrong if the standards arenâ€™t applied equally and not everybody else is being sent home. If the ### is hanging from ### head and they only put it on when the boss comes around, theyâ€™re knowingly disobeying the standard or they wouldnâ€™t put it on when they see their boss. The boss sees this yet picks and chooses who he enforces it upon. The file is too large to upload in the designated place44194.7763888889 I'm so terribly sorry to hear about your termination.Unfortunately, based on the details I have thus far, I do not see any obvious employment law claims in what you're describing. Having said that, it sounds like there might be some value in a consultation with a lawyer who specializes in employment law where you can spend time drilling down on some of the other things you've referenced in passing (but that we haven't focused on) to determine whether there are claims that we have not identified.  I do not know of a way to avoid consultation fees entirely as you'd asked in the initial question, but the North Carolina Bar does have a referral service where you can call and request a referral to a lawyer that specializes in employment law and the lawyer will provide an initial consultation at a reduced fee (usually it's a ### $50).  That referral service can be reached at: 800-###.I am also happy to answer any other questions or concerns and help get your thoughts organized, so feel free to keep using this conversation to reach me.  Thank you and all the best.44195.6284722222 I'm sorry for the extra email, but I should have also asked how many employees the company has.  This should include all employees ###.  If you aren't sure, the thresholds that matter are whether there are more or less than ### ###, so if you could give a rough guess that can help work through the analysis.44194.7979166667 Mr. ###, Thanks for posting your question.  In general employment is at-will" and employers have the ability to impose workplace standards and rules with pretty broad latitude.  There can be exceptions so before getting to deep into answering your question it would be very helpful if you could let me know if you are in a union or otherwise have a contract for employment.  If either of those things are the case there may be specific procedures your employer needs to follow in order to discipline you. Please let me know the answer to this and I should be able to get you a more detailed specific answer.  Thanks!"44194.7194444444 Thanks for the quick reply. I'm sorry the website wouldn't let you upload the pictures, but there is no need to (I have no reason to doubt your description of them). You are correct that the union (or ###) status of the PA office won't matter for your purposes.  And it sounds like you would be an at-will employee due to the expiration of the initial contract. In that case, whether or not disciplinary action taken at work is fair" or consistently applied is not necessarily grounds for a lawsuit.  But if you don't mind answering a few more questions we should be able to pin down whether it makes sense to schedule a consultation with an employment attorney.How was the time off you took early in COVID classified? In other words was it a leave of absence sick time vacation days or something else? There are certain types of leave that are protected from retaliation and so the type of leave is important. Are there other differences between you and the employees that are not being disciplined for wearing the ###?  Other than that they go through the motions of putting them on when the boss comes around.  Are there differences between you and the employees that have not been retaliated against for taking time off in the early days of COVID?Thanks again."44194.7868055556 The time off was taken at our discretion once the President started to offer ### for companies allowing it. The company tries to use things like that verbally as leverage over their employees. The inmates that were working there at the time were pulled out of the plant by the state at the beginning of COVID and production went down. I donâ€™t believe our vacation time was used. The other employees in the plant work side by within feet of each other as to where Iâ€™m usually confined to my truck. I deliver what they produce. There are times where I would have to be stuck at the plant when my truck would go down for repairs. One employee recently had pacemaker implanted and works less than ### from another employee with a face covering around his neck most of the time inside the plant, within the bosses view from his office. There are non employees alike delivering loads to UPG without wearing face coverings within the bosses view. If Iâ€™m not mistaken they employ between 200-### ###. I was terminated this evening as a Driver for UPG. The things weâ€™ve been carrying on about are just the beginning of what kind of stuff that goes on there 44194.9194444444 I have been ### with the Unemployment people/ person's since the month ### September on why I was not getting my weekly benefits any longer.

I want the first one I filed for handled and to receive the money owed, so I can pay my rent that I am now behind on up. I have yet to get a proper answer on why I was even terminated with ###'t even used up that you've been pre approved for and I still can not ### the pier ### ###. What can I do to possibly get this handled and straigthened out to receive the money they terminated without notice or regurd. As I am currently seeking employement inwhich I will not be re applying for another claim I just want what I was already pre aporoved for to be paid in full and for me to use that money to pay my bills im now behind on.44199.5625 You can appeal your determination letter.  44285.7159722222 On disability since 2008,SSDI as of 10/2010.Medical Coverage through Large Group Health Plan.Advised by Medicare I did not need to enroll in Medicare Part B as I had employer coverage.

Those that work less than ###. did not get paid.44204.5625 It is discriminatory, but not in a legal sense.  An employer can create a policy to provide pay for holidays that he or she chooses.  They can do the same with vacation and sick leave.  Pay is not required in North Carolina for any of those for a private employer.  44204.58125 Hello, I am a truck driver and I am trying to get ### $###.

What is the easier course to take? Should I just go to small claims instead? Or do I need to go through the Department of Labor first in order to take the right steps? The company missclassified me as ###'m having trouble getting a lawyer to take my case on contingency. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you. 44204.9333333333 Hello, Thanks for your response on this. The dates worked and unpaid are ###th to ###th. When I called the NC DOL they told me that they could only fight for wages earned IN North Carolina. Should i try them again? I think I may bring a small claims case against them but I will exhaust my efforts with the DOL if you think that will be effective. Thank you for the links on independent contractors. I will read over the info.To be clear, I did not have a written contract with this employer. I asked for one at the beginning of my employment but they consistently delayed providing it. I DO have very good records of the driving that I did as well as previous paystubs from them. I also have voice recordings of them telling me that they're going to pay me, and texts from them during the work period in question regarding daily work affairs. So, perhaps I can't sue for breach of contract but do I still have a case for my wages?Thank you again for your time with this. Best Regards, ###44217.0201388889 Sorry to hear about your situation. You noted your last day of work was ### and you were fired on ###. But you then say that for two weeks, you drove around the country for your employer. Can you please specify the dates you were working and unpaid (for example, was it ### through ###?).Regardless of my question above, it appears you did work and were not paid your wages for that work by your North Carolina employer. Given these facts, you would not need to go through the labor departments in all of the states you drove through. You can instead just contact the North Carolina Department of Labor.You can also bring a lawsuit directly to recover for unpaid wages under NCGS 95-25.22. Here is a link to Chapter ###. That Chapter includes the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act, which ### NCGS 95-25.### 95-25.25.

Best Regards, ###44218.9006944444 You do not have to have a written contract to recover unpaid wages from your employer. The voice recordings you have and texts will bolster your claim.Since your company is based in NC and you are a NC citizen, it appears to me that the NC Wage and Hour Act applies to your claims. I would try the DOL again and emphasize that your are a NC citizen that was working for a NC employer. If they still say they cannot help you, politely ask them if there is a statute or rule that keeps them from helping you.Another route to take would be to consult with a plaintiff's labor law firm. These firms usually take cases on a contingency basis. That means you do not pay them by the hour and they only get paid from a percentage of what they recover for you. Here is a link to a few firms that may be willing to take your case on that basis. I would also expect them to at least give you a free consultation:### NC Employment Law Lawyers | Wrongful Termination & Discrimination Law Firm (maloneylegal.com)### Business & Employment Law | Personal Injury Lawyer (kinglatham.com)### North Carolina Employment & Disability Lawyers | ### Leis, PLLC (carolinaemploymentlawyer.com)44218.8895833333 ###,Your question noted that you had your lawyer send a letter on your behalf. If you are still using that lawyer, I would pose these questions to that person and follow that lawyer's advice.However, if you are no longer using that lawyer, I would enforce the deadline you gave the owner / manager to pay your wages. Thus, if that deadline has passed, I would file suit under the NC Wage and Hour Act for unpaid wages and I would also make a claim for breach of contract. The company cannot bring criminal charges--only the District Attorney can on behalf of the state. I think the District Attorney would see this as a commercial dispute and refuse to bring criminal charges. Even if the DA brings charges, the text messages you have should provide you a complete defense.However, you noted that the company would likely counter sue you. Therefore, understand that if you sue this company, they will likely counter sue you for taking their property (conversion). But any counterclaims will be in a civil lawsuit and not impose any potential criminal liability.Here is a guide on filing small claims actions in North Carolina.A Guide to Small Claims Court | Legal Aid of North Carolina (legalaidnc.org)44207.8 Also, I noted that you could sue under the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act (the Act").Here is a link to the Act:Chapter 95 - Article ### (###)See particularly NCGS 95-25.22."44207.8006944444 Hello, I was fired on ###th after complaining to the company owner on ###th of various safety concerns. When I was fired I was in possession of a few items owned by the company - some cords and a laptop bag. Combined value of $###. When I was fired I asked the owner to send me an address to ship the items. He asked me to instead return them to the manager and I said that I would be happy to do that, and to please ask the manager to get in touch with me to arrange the drop off or mailing of these items. This correspondence occured by text and I have records of it. The Manager did not get in touch with me, did not try to call and was not returning my messages. I reiterated again, to the owner, that I had not heard from the manager. A week later I had my lawyer send a letter to the owner and manager asking for my unpaid wages with a deadline, after which I would be filing complaints with government agencies and a suit for my wages if necessary. The manager wrote back immediately claiming that I had stolen company property and threatening to bring a criminal suit against me for larceny. How should I proceed if they are unwilling to organize the return and obviously want to use this to set up or threaten a counter claim? They also are holding items of mine valuing $###.###.

While each case is different from another, generally speaking, a no-fault settlement means that the case is resolved through private settlement between adverse parties, and the respondent does not admit fault or liability.  It is a basically a way for the respondent to pay the petitioner a sum of money to resolve a dispute, yet not be held responsible or at fault for any illegal or actionable conduct.I hope the following link below from EEOC might help you in terms of further reading and information:https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/resolving-chargeBlessings and best wishes to you in 2021.44208.0895833333 what is a a no fault settlement to the respondent mean in terms of a EEOC case?44208.0076388889
